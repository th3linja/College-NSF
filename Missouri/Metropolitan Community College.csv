The project has a dual focus as it delivers services to these populations. The first emphasis is on those students who have participated in the articulated Tech Prep programs facilitated by Metropolitan Community College (MCC) in the College's four-county service area in eastern Nebraska. The second emphasis targets former and current students from the Omaha Public School (OPS) District's Banneker Partnership. <br/><br/>MCC's Tech Prep program delivers career opportunities to hundreds of high school students from twenty-eight high schools in the College's service area. This program helps students to identify and explore potential careers of interest. <br/><br/>The Banneker Partnership is an NSF Urban Systemic Initiative Grant with OPS that focuses on preparing high schools for success at the postsecondary level in math and science courses. <br/><br/>Project PISCES is providing scholarships to twenty-five individuals who are enrolled as full-time students at Metropolitan Community College, majoring in computer science or pre- engineering. These students are, upon attainment of their two-year Associate's Degree, either transitioning into the workforce or transferring into a four-year Bachelor's Degree at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. In addition to scholarship support, Project PISCES includes a student support infrastructure that includes a variety of support activities, such as mentoring, tutoring, job shadowing, internships, and cohort support groups. <br/>"

This degree program will be housed in the newly refurbished state-of-the-art Advanced Manufacturing Institute at Metropolitan Community College. According to the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center, manufacturing accounts for 17% of the job market and 18% of total income in the Kansas City Region. Due to industry growth, the Mid-America Regional Council projects the need for 34,000 production workers in Kansas City over the next five years. The current Computer Integrated Machining and Manufacturing program educates technicians in Precision Machining and offers internships and job placement with industry partners. Although working at capacity, the program cannot educate enough technicians to meet current industry needs. This project aims to increase the number of highly skilled machining technicians in the Kansas City region by providing distance learning opportunities in precision machining to students in rural areas within the region served by the college.<br/><br/>This project aims to increase the number of highly skilled precision machining technicians in the Greater Kansas City area by 1) providing virtual instruction through a Zoom link platform to students in rural service areas who cannot travel to the college campus for classes, and 2) offering contextualized machining math through a video module platform. The project expects these efforts to provide rural students with access to a highly successful machining program and to prepare them for work as precision machining technicians. As a result, the distance program has the potential to expand the current pipeline of precision machining technicians to include rural students who will gain the knowledge and skills needed to enter the precision machining workforce in local industries.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For industry, the Metropolitan Community College (MCC) BAS IT degree option is preparing skilled technicians for a variety of careers demanding strong foundations in IT concepts and skills - from critical facilities operations to advanced manufacturing, network security, energy management, and continuous commissioning. Upon completion of the BAS option IT Associates, graduates are prepared for a wide range of IT-enhanced careers such as managing interoperable facilities systems, advanced manufacturing operations, network security, general IT systems, and critical facilities such as data centers. <br/><br/>MCC and partners are developing, field testing, and delivering learning resources for technician training through a new Building Automation Systems (BAS) option within an Information Technology Associates Degree. The primary audiences for the developed resources are two-year college students, dual credit high school BAS Academy students, and dual credit high school and college students. <br/><br/>Eight new BAS-contextualized IT courses will be developed, including lesson plans, assessments, hands-on kits, video, and other visual based elements. Access to Automate! resources will be available through the cloud and through open online venues such as YouTube.<br/><br/>The project is examining the effectiveness of the process of materials development; the impact of the BAS contextualized IT learning on student enrollment, performance and retention in the BAS option and the IT Associates degree track; and the value of the BAS technician training to industry."

Consequently, industries increasingly need teams of workers who can fill multiple roles and communicate clearly with others, while performing a variety of tasks. This collaborative, flexible work environment is supported by an Intelligent Industrial Internet-of-Things (I4T), a sophisticated network of machines, systems, and humans that work together to manufacture goods. This project will develop and deploy an online learning platform and curriculum to prepare skilled technicians to work effectively in I4T settings. Working in cross-functional teams assigned to hands-on projects, students will learn to use a shared vocabulary, and to work effectively and collaboratively in diverse teams. The training aims to establish a pipeline of manufacturing technicians who can use technologies for competitive advantages. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop, pilot, refine, and deliver interdisciplinary team-based training on I4T systems for manufacturing. To achieve these goals, the project aims to develop learning modules to support training in Rapid Prototyping, Lean Production, Just-In-Time Inventory Management, and Predictive Maintenance/Reduced Downtime; these learning modules will also form an integral part of a Prototype Design degree. The faculty developing the learning modules will collaborate with Instructional Designers on curriculum design. Experts in advanced manufacturing and automated guided vehicles will provide subject matter expertise, to ensure that modules are relevant to industry needs.  The learning modules will feature hands-on, problem-based activity kits designed to train both high school and college students to work with I4T. Industry partners will provide both hardware, such as sensors and web-based dashboards, and the expertise required to develop real life scenarios across the four topic areas. The cost of individual kits will be kept low by using readily available materials. Teams of high school and college teachers will be invited to participate in Train-the-Trainer workshops, to learn how to deploy the learning modules at their schools. The trainers will subsequently offer a series of one-day workshops and three-day summer boot camps to middle school, high school, and college students. Faculty will be trained to incorporate the platform and modules across production-related programs. In addition, they will receive training in problem-based learning techniques and ways to engage women. The low cost and supportive training should facilitate adoption by other institutions. Resources and results will be disseminated broadly through venues such as Hi-Tech annual conferences, the National Convergence Technology Center, the ATE Central website, and professional research journals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
