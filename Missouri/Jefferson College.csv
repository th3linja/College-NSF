SPM represents a family of techniques that can image surfaces at the nanoscopic level and would play an integral role in both our research and our curriculum.  AFM would be used in several research projects, including 1) the controlled patterning of block copolymer nanostructures, 2) the development of synthetic cells consisting of an inorganic core, lipid membranes, and biological proteins, and 3) the measurement of nanoscale liquid droplet wetting on rough surfaces.  Understanding and controlling the patterning of nanostructures is crucial in the continued push for smaller and smaller technologies while synthetic cells would combine biological properties with the ease of handling stable inorganic molecules.  Wetting research uses the AFM in ways that are just beginning to be explored, investigating the pinning of the contact line on nanoscale defects, an important topic in all applications of spreading.  The SPM will be housed in the new $32 million John A. Swanson Science Center, scheduled to open in 2010.  Training on the instrument will be significantly enhanced by a proposed SPM virtual instrument.  AFM and STM will also be integrated into the teaching of introductory physics, upper level physics and chemistry classes, as well as general education courses for non-science majors on nanotechnology.  Local high school students will be impacted through our science education outreach programs.  The SPM would thus introduce an entirely new direction in both the research and teaching curriculum at W&J by introducing concepts inherent to surface science and materials research. <br/><br/>Non-Technical Abstract:<br/>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). <br/><br/>This is a multi-disciplinary proposal to purchase a scanning probe microscopy system (SPM) for Washington & Jefferson (W&J) College, a private four year undergraduate institution.  SPM allows us to image surfaces at the nanoscopic level and would play an integral role in both our research and our curriculum.  The SPM would be used in several research projects.  For example, polymer nanostructures could be seen through SPM, allowing us to investigate different ways of controlling the size, shape, and structure of these tiny domains.  Being able to pattern these nanostructures is crucial in the continued push for smaller and smaller technologies.  The SPM would also allow us to develop synthetic cells; these would mimic real cell surfaces but be more robust and easier to handle, providing a model for biochemical research.  Another project would use the SPM to image nano-sized liquid droplets wetting rough surfaces.  This research is important in better understanding how a liquid spreads on a surface, with industrial applications ranging from semiconductor manufacture and oil extraction to paper towels and dish soap.  The SPM will be housed in the new $32 million John A. Swanson Science Center, scheduled to open in 2010.  To train students, we intend to develop a simulated instrument, allowing them to practice on a computer before touching the actual one.  SPM will also be integrated into the teaching of introductory physics, upper level physics and chemistry classes, as well as general education courses for non-science majors on nanotechnology.  Local high school students will be impacted through our science education outreach programs.

The development of new materials continues to improve our daily lives, and it is often at the molecular-level that one finds the most important behavior of these materials.  Increasingly, scientists produce novel materials for which it is not possible to obtain structures utilizing traditional diffraction methods. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has become a premier tool for structure determination in these cases. The chemical shift, a property describing the electronic environment of molecules, is a key feature of NMR spectroscopy. By measuring and modeling the chemical shift anisotropy, NMR spectroscopy becomes a more powerful tool in explaining the structure of materials. <br/> <br/>Professor Iuliucci will be exploring the relationship between complex quantum mechanical calculations and chemical-shift anisotropy measurements.   With the use of a database of experimental chemical-shift anisotropy measurements, calculations of the shift can be calibrated enabling a precise knowledge of the relationship between molecular structure and the NMR spectrum.  The creation of new experimental databases of accurate anisotropy measurements is necessary to expand this structure-shift relationship to functional materials.  This research thus aims to make solid-state NMR an accessible and realiable tool for analysis, allowing scientists to develop new materials with predictable properties and applications.  <br/><br/>A key focus of this endeavor is the training of students for careers in the physical sciences.  Research experience augments the undergraduate's education and exposes the student to cutting-edge scientific areas of study.  While most work will be conducted at Washington and Jefferson College, a primarily undergraduate institution, students will also have the opportunity to use top-notch resources through collaborations with research institutions (high-field NMR at Pennsylvania State University, computer clusters at the University of Utah, and micro-scale NMR probes at Radboud University Nijmegen, the Netherlands).  Such experiences will enhance the undergraduate's education, allowing them to participate in the international scientific community."

The eye tracking system enables pursuing further work and greater quantitative analysis in design and usability research focused on issues such as the effect of the interface design of security-focused software on the secure behaviors and awareness of security features of the software users.<br/>Current work at the institution focuses on the particular application of these methods in an introductory programming course. The Information Technology Leadership (ITL) faculty have broaden their research to encompass more mobile computing that has contributed in developing a collaboration with Biology faculty. In turn, this collaboration has given rise to a mobile application used when collecting ecological data in the field. A beta version, now under assessment, has been created and deployed where the eye tracking methods will be used to confirm that mobile technologies enable not only more accurate data collection, but better learning and retention on the part of the student researchers in the field.<br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>This solely undergraduate institution core mission focuses on research involving significant undergraduate collaboration. In particular, the ITL Department is committed to enabling its majors to take part in significant research projects that allow them to act as true collaborators and not simply as coders or lab technicians. Thus, with an existing history of engaging undergraduates in design and usability research, a modern eye tracking system will strengthen the program making it accessible to more students. The system will play a role in classroom activities, labs, and independent projects. Students should gain fluency with the tool and with appropriate methods for using it in regular coursework. A service management course will be required for all seniors to partner with local non-profits to provide technical consulting or development. The system provides a platform for continued interdisciplinary research, including ongoing work in Biology and potential projects that involve Political Science, Gender and Women?s Studies, Sociology, and Psychology."

Questions concerning when and how categorical representations emerge in infancy is therefore  central to the study of perceptual and cognitive development.  The aim of this project is to further our knowledge about the development of complex, perceptually-based categorical representations in young infants.  The results will help us to understand how children learn, and should have relevance for issues concerning early childhood education, and developmental disabilities.<br/><br/>A series of experiments using the familiarization-novelty preference procedure will be conducted to study the categorical representations formed by infants at superordinate (e.g., animal, furniture), basic (e.g., dog, chair), and subordinate (e.g., German Shepherd, living room chair) levels across the first year of life. Specific experiments are planned to examine: (1) the ages at which infants first develop representations for superordinate, basic, and subordinate categories;  (2) whether representations for superordinate categories precede those at the basic and subordinate levels;  (3) whether methodological factors such as the number of exemplars presented to the infant underlie apparent differences in previous findings on the development of representations for superordinate and basic categories; and (4) what surface attributes of the stimuli (e.g., overall shape, particular parts, color, texture, etc.) infants extract when forming category representations at different levels.<br/>"
