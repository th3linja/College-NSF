The goal is to prepare students so they may complete associate degrees, matriculate to four-year institutions, and enter the STEM workforce. Experienced faculty and staff and industry partners support student recruitment and career placement and select sixteen S3 Academy scholarship recipients each year. <br/><br/>This five-year project continues successful practices by:  <br/>(1) Increasing the number of students receiving degrees in biotechnology, chemical technology, computer science, engineering science, engineering technology, and mathematics. <br/>(2) Increasing the academic success of S3 Academy students compared to non-S3 Academy students. <br/>(3) Increasing the number of women, racial and ethnic minorities, and persons with disabilities in the S3 Academy as compared to STEM students at the college. <br/>(4) Maintaining the S3 Academy community. <br/>(5) Strengthening college partnerships with academic and industrial STEM leaders. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This project advances knowledge and understanding within six STEM fields by providing scholarships and multiple support services, thereby increasing number of students studying and succeeding in these high-quality academic programs at the college. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The project prepares S3 Academy students to participate as scientists working together on task forces to solve problems; communicate effectively; and learn lifelong skills adaptable to workplace changes. The S3 Academy opens doors that otherwise would remain closed to many students. Through dissemination, the college aims to make the S3 Academy a model program for replication at community colleges nationwide."

These include both large companies such as Bayer Crop Sciences (formerly Monsanto) and the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, and small start-up companies. As basic research in genetics leads to the development of new technologies across these companies, current and future employees must learn new skills. Through this project, to address growing industry education and training needs, St. Louis Community College (STLCC) will develop new courses in targeted genome editing to enhance its Biotechnology AAS and Certificate programs. The project will combine academic and industry interests to develop a set of courses that will meet the high standards needed in a demanding but fulfilling field.  STLCC will collaborate with industry partners in the development, testing, and refinement of curriculum pertaining to targeted genome editing. As a result STLCC's 2-year biotechnician graduates will be able to gain cutting edge training and education, internship, and employment opportunities. These programmatic improvements will support the region's need for qualified technicians and extend graduates' employment opportunities to national and international enterprises. <br/><br/>Building on the success of a previous ATE award, this project will develop a highly technical curriculum, driven by industry needs, to address the demand for mid-level technicians with genome editing bench skills, including critical downstream assessment capabilities to evaluate the success or failure of the intended genomic change. The development of these courses will benefit new students entering the Biotechnology program at STLCC and will also be available to incumbent workers in need of these additional skills to advance in their current positions. Students and incumbent workers will also gain valuable specialized training on the equipment obtained through this award. With the support of leaders at all levels of the region's bioscience industry this academic-business partnership will ensure the project's skills curriculum, and its implementation, will meet the needs of researchers and provide highly skilled, technically proficient graduates. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To accomplish this goal, the St. Louis Community College (SLCC) Center for Plant and Life Sciences, with a biotechnology technician training program in a post-incubator facility, allows SLCC to assist growing companies as they navigate the early years of existence. The SLCC provides local companies with a Contract Research Organization (CRO) with which they can contract work to the SLCC training programs, allowing them to get work completed locally, and utilizing equipment that the company doesn't have access to, while giving the technicians training in real-world experiences. The CRO provides a much needed service for growing companies, while providing on-site internships for students enrolled in the technician program.  Students in the program will gain cutting edge technical skills and scientific knowledge to advance their future careers in the life sciences.  The project also provides awareness programs for middle and high school students within the St. Louis region to educate them on the opportunities available within the plant and life science industry. Local teachers receive training on plant and life science-related concepts and procedures that can be incorporated into their existing science curriculums that raise the awareness and understanding of students as to the critical need for the industry and the many employment opportunities available.  The project is guided by an industry advisory committee from partner organizations to establish training needs, establish partnerships with growing companies, and assist with the identification of candidates for the program.  In addition, the project provides emerging companies with needed incentives to stay in the region and grow to fuel the growth of the entire life sciences industry within the city and state."

We plan a collaborative effort between the Biology students, Technical Illustration students and English Department staff in the production of lab guides for the equipment. These lab guides will be produced as Hypercard stacks that will allow the students to step through the processes of equipment set-up, data acquisition and reporting of results. Producing these lab guides as an on-screen manual, and utilizing the talents of students and faculty in several different departments represents an exciting innovation in the use of this type of equipment.The equipment and lab guides will be demonstrated at the Women's Math and Science Network, at a local Middle School and at the Missouri Community College Association annual meeting. ***"
