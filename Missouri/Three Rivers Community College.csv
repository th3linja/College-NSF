Thederegulation and globalization of the telecommunications industry has resulted in a rapid increase in the demand for technicians educated in lightwave communications. A recent federally funded study predicted that the demand for photonics technicians, including fiber optics technicians, would nearly double to 740,000 by the year 2000. A meeting of the Connecticut Photonics Industry Cluster inthe Spring of 1997 described a critical need for technicians in the state, and urged that fiber optics programs at the State's Community-Technical Colleges be strengthened. To address this need, the Lightwave Communications Laboratory is providing students with experience with a state-of-the-art fiber optic communication system. Each station emulates a ""real world"" lightwave communication system, capable of transmitting multi-gigabit information through several kilometers of optical fiber. The opportunity to gain hands-on experience better prepares students for careers in photonics or telecommunications or to pursue additional studies at the baccalaureate level."

The program is<br/>integrated into the network built upon the Tech Prep School-to-Career program at the college, a well established partnership of 20 high schools and the college. The promotion of the program is accomplished by a project team of college faculty, counselors and administrators assisted by a network of high school teachers and counselors, local industry and community groups. Throughout their college program of study, TOP Scholars are mentored by a faculty member to ensure they make full use of available support services, including a range of workshops , short courses, and peer tutoring offered by the Tutoring and Academic Success Center. The cohort of TOP scholarship students forms a clearly identifiable learning community, with program specific enrichment opportunities such as group meetings and industry tours and speakers. Upon graduation, students are assisted by the Career Placement Office and full time Transfer Counselor to secure placement in the workforce or in a four -year engineering, physics or computer science program.<br/><br/>The goals of the project are<br/>1.  to increase the number of academically- talented and low-income students who complete associate degree programs in computer science and technology; <br/>2.  to increase the number of women and minority students in these programs;<br/>3.  to create a partnership of educators and industry to enhance the experience and participation of scholarship students; and <br/>4.  to establish a system to document the impact of the TOP Scholars program on participants in order to affect continuous program improvements.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this program is that a pathway is being created to enable economically disadvantaged, mostly first generation college students to successfully earn<br/>a college degree and transition to employment in computer science or technology or to a four year institution. The broader impact is that a community of scholars is being formed, mentored by faculty and community members, which enhances the vitality of the Technology Department. Support services created for TOP scholars serve as a model for student retention in all college programs.<br/>"

The project is adding fiber optic wavelength division multiplexing capability to their existing laboratory and providing students with a hands-on experience with sophisticated equipment. They are adapting four experiments developed by NCTT and are considering four new ones based on suggestions by their industry partners. In the evaluation effort, they will analyze student report, written exams, and the students' performance on practical exams to determine if the students achieve the learning objectives. The dissemination plan involves presentation to PHOTON project participants, at the NCTT workshop, and at national conferences along with publications in the PROTON and NCTT newsletters and in professional journals."

It is recruiting high school students to technology academic programs and creating new mechanisms for retaining those students. Central Connecticut State University, Fairfield University School of Engineering and the University of Connecticut (2 colleges) are assisting in the project and take part in 2+2+2 programs. The South Carolina ATE Center is assisting with curriculum development.<br/><br/>Project activities include:<br/>1. Improving the academic readiness of students entering engineering technology programs (primarily with a summer institute); <br/>2. Creating a learning community model for application in community college engineering technology programs, including on site and online mentors;<br/>3. Developing and testing paired algebra and technology interdisciplinary courses, one in mathematics and one an introduction to technology;<br/>4. Developing a project-based interdisciplinary capstone course that includes all of the engineering technology programs; and<br/>5. Raising student, faculty and counselor awareness of educational and career opportunities in technology fields, particularly for members of under-represented groups.<br/>"

This project permits the mathematics faculty to incorporate new and existing computer software into the curriculum of college algebra, trigonometry, calculus I, II, and III. The project provides 15 microcomputers, six printers, and Derive software for use by mathematics faculty in addition to software provided by textbook publishers. Derive intelligently applies the rules of algebra, trigonometry, calculus, and matrix algebra to solve a wide range of mathematical problems. Powerful capabilities exist for both two-dimensional (Cartesian, polar, and parametric) and three- dimensional graphing."
