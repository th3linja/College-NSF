Lab modules involve experimentation, computerized analysis of results, and linking of results to material on the World Wide Web and elsewhere on the Internet. Module themes are reinforced by concept review kiosks in the classroom corridors and by computer-controlled multimedia material in the classroom. To update the CASE lab, the project involves acquiring Macintosh Power PC computers and Logal instrument Interface bundles and networking the computers to a server and to the Internet. Lab instructions are produced as HyperText Markup Language documents located on the server. Also located on the server are a commercial networkable database, statistical analysis package, and a multi-user version of HyperCard. The kiosks house computers with continuously running HyperCard stacks that provide spoken pronunciation of terms, definitions, and illustrations where useful. The programs can be manipulated through touch screen controls. Identical programs are available to students in the Learning Resource Center (LRC). Kiosk and LRC computers can be networked to the CASE lab for ease of maintenance and updating. Mobile stand-alone computer carts with multimedia control devices enable instructors to refer to the lab modules while in the classroom and also to reinforce the protein themes through use of laser discs, videocassettes, and CD-ROMs ."
