The project directed by Nebraska Indian Community College (NICC) titled ?Expansion of the Science Discipline at the Nebraska Indian Community Project? addresses this goal through the implementation of a planning grant to assist in guiding the college in the development of a long-term STEM capacity-building plan. The project?s objectives are to conduct a needs assessment and feasibility study to gather information about the types of STEM programs that would most benefit the college and community and NICC?s readiness to deliver those programs. Findings will be used to guide the college in directing resources and applying for future funding to support the expansion of their STEM offerings.<br/><br/>Providing quality higher education and lifelong educational opportunities to all learners is NICC?s mission. One way to advance that mission is through the expansion of the STEM degree and research programs at the college. This project?s work will support that agenda through a comprehensive assessment of NICC?s existing STEM capacity and compilation of data about tribal community and student interest in STEM program expansion. Findings generated will be applied to informing the college?s future steps for expanding their STEM capacity through the addition of new STEM baccalaureate programs and STEM research programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project directed by Nebraska Indian Community College (NICC) titled ?Transformative Capacity Building: Targeted STEM Infusion Project? directly addresses TCUP?s goal through the establishment of a microbiology laboratory and the development of a microbiology laboratory course that better prepares their students to enter the workforce and/or matriculate to another institution to pursue a four-year STEM degree. The project?s objectives are to ensure that the laboratory is fully equipped and protocols and training are in place that prioritize student and staff safety. The laboratory course will include locally relevant content and evidence-based instructional methods and will be pilot tested to optimize its effectiveness in support student learning. The course is guaranteed fully transferable across Nebraska institutions of higher education. NICC's videoconferencing capabilities successfully enable the delivery of courses, including this one, to serve three campuses, broadening the reach of the project.<br/><br/>NICC?s mission is to provide quality higher education and lifelong educational opportunities to all learners. Expansion of the science disciplines at the college is one way to advance that mission. The addition of microbiology, a required course and/or approved elective for numerous STEM baccalaureate degree programs, supports students? pathways to baccalaureate degrees as well as additional careers options for graduates with public, private, and tribal entities. The project?s work to strength NICC?s Laboratory Health and Safety Plan (HSP) and to train all STEM faculty in the HSP protocols benefits all laboratory courses and degree programs at the college, thereby building NICC?s capacity in STEM education and research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Humans overwhelmingly organize information in order to facilitate maximum comprehension.  In spoken and signed language, salient information is most often presented to the conversant first.  This is then followed with a contextualizing comment or additional modification.  This organization of information is thought to facilitate comprehension.  The main meaning of a word, for example, often comes first, and then, may be followed by suffixes that lend further modification, e.g. English 'like' and 'liked'.  There are a small set of languages worldwide that place all or most modifying information at the beginning of the word, that is, in prefixes rather than in suffixes.  These languages challenge theories of how speakers package information so that hearers can best comprehend a message.  Many such prefixing languages are endangered so that the key to the cognitive processes that allow for comprehension even in the face of unexpected information organization will soon be lost.  <br/><br/>The highly endangered Siouan Native American language Omaha is one such complex prefixing language.  This project will lead to valuable documentation of a variety of genres of Omaha from the few remaining elders who speak the language fluently.  The data gathered will inform theories on the cognitive processing of word structure where comment and modification precede the semantic core of the word.  In addition Omaha data will contribute to morphological theories on the organization of affixes:  most languages organize derivational morphology before inflection but in Omaha inflectional and derivational morphology are interdigitated.<br/><br/>Community members Micheal Oltrogge and Alice Saunsoci of the Omaha language department of the Nebraska Indian Community College will work with the tribe's Elders Language Advisory Council to create a database of conversational and narrative discourse in Omaha from thirty fluent Elders.  The team will use state-of-the art language documentation protocol to collect, transcribe, and translate the data.  This work will be conducted in collaboration with linguist Ardis Eschenberg who will also help the team produce a book on Omaha verbs.  <br/><br/>Both the audio and video documentation and material on Omaha verbs will be accessible from the Sam Noble museum.  The project will broaden participation of Native American language experts through the training in documentary linguistics they will receive as a result of this project."
