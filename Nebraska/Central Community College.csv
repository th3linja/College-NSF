The camp will utilize classroom and lab facilities at Seattle Central Community College. The goal of the program is to motivate underachieving minority students to pursue science, math and technology studies as they continue in school. Activities are designed to increase awareness of the region's environment and how urbanization has affected water quality in the Puget Sound region. The camp will serve approximately 75 students recruited from Seattle area middle schools with the assistance of counselors, teachers, community organizations, case workers, churches and parents. Careers in Electronics, Engineering, Computer Science, Biotechnology and Environmental Science have been targeted for their job growth potential in Washington state. The Biosphere Of Tomorrow integrates activities in life, earth and physical sciences with math and computers to current social and environmental issues. Principles from these areas will be linked to daily life through experiments, design problems,field studies and collaborative group problem-solving activities. Sessions will be held six hours a day, Monday through Thursday, with Fridays devoted to field studies. Students rotate in teams attending team- taught sessions with professionals from the representative fields. The camp will focus on water quality, exploring the hydrologic cycle, watershed management, conservation, pollution, and hazardous waste disposal. Uses of water, including the generation of electricity and its role in the economic vitality of the region will be explored. S tudents will conduct longitudinal site studies examining impacts to water quality. Water samples will be collected and analyzed from four diverse sites in Puget Sound. An overnight ""Camp-In"" will be held at the Pacific Science Center. Years two and three, students will grow bacteria that produce plastic naturally and learn how to extract DNA from cultures. Results from site studies will be utilized from year to year tracing impacts to water quality in the region over time. Problem- solving exercises, probability, statistics, entering data into spreadsheets and graphs, and visual documentation will integrate lab activities with math and computer studies. Students will learn software authoring skills in order to produce a multi-media presentation and display of their group's results for a culminating event open to the public. Hot lunches and daily transportation are provided. At the end of the camp, students are recognized with a certificate and take-home science kit. Two scholarships to camps at the Pacific Science Center will be awarded to a boy and a girl selected by faculty. Teaching Assistants will recruited from high school and college minority science programs including Math, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA), and the Minority Teaching Academy to work with community mentors in the camp. Career assistance workshops, a parent outreach event and follow-u activities during the school year are included to reinforce and support the efforts of the program. A corresponding in-service teacher training institute will be offered to fifteen Washington state teachers to develop culturally relevant, anti-bias science teaching strategies with at- risk students. ***"

The central goal of this project is to promote collaboration between teachers of mathematics and earth and environmental science, and encourage partial or comprehensive curricular revision linking these disciplines. One reason for the absence of such course materials in colleges and high schools is that few appropriate classroom-ready resources have been available, particularly in environmental mathematics. This project is addressing this need by generating resources that are modular, flexible, and easy to implement in diverse educational settings. <br/><br/>This project is creating a series of classroom exercises designed to investigate topics in environmental and earth science using introductory college mathematics. These educational materials draw heavily on real world data, promote student investigation and collaboration, and make use of existing classroom technologies. The project is designing a website with links to data sets for approximately 15 environmental science and 15 mathematics topics. Each data set is packaged with background information and a short description of its utility for classroom use. Each data set will be made available in a variety of formats to promote maximum accessibility by the community of users through different technologies. The website also offers a ""forum"" devoted to sharing ideas and teaching methods related to these resources. <br/><br/>The materials are being assessed by site testers in community colleges, high schools, and four-year colleges. The project will be evaluated based on student learning gains. In particular, the project will assess the impact on female students. The project will conclude with a workshop for the site testers.

The goal of the project is to increase the number of qualified I&C technicians to meet the state's current workforce needs and promote a pipeline of future technicians. To accomplish this goal, the project is leveraging CCC's state-of-the-art Mechatronics Education Center and well-established business, education, and community relationships to develop a Process Instrumentation and Controls specialization within its existing Mechatronics AAS degree program. While the fundamentals found in the first year of both the existing electromechanical and the new I&C program pathways are similar, the I&C pathway distinguishes itself in that the fundamentals are applied in a processing environment instead of an advanced manufacturing environment. The I&C pathway is the first AAS degree program in Nebraska to focus primarily on the unique needs of Nebraska processing facilities. This is important because there is a shortage of qualified skilled technicians for both processing and manufacturing businesses, and, prior to the project, processing facilities could only compete with manufacturers for graduates of manufacturing-related technician programs. <br/><br/>With guidance from its Business-Industry Leadership Team, the project will modify/create up to 18 credit hours of new Process Instrumentation and Controls material for integration and alignment with existing coursework to form the new I&C specialization. The I&C specialization will provide education and skills that emphasize properties of liquids and gases using sensing and control devices that measure pressure, temperature, flow, volume density, and chemical composition. The new specialization will help create a pipeline of skilled I&C technicians and promote a Nebraska workforce with improved skills, knowledge, and abilities ultimately leading to more competitive businesses. To build and promote early college pipelines, the project is providing professional development and awareness activities for secondary educators and their students so they can introduce and integrate Mechatronics career pathways into the schools. To increase the diversity of the program, the project is implementing strategies to attract women, Hispanics, and military veterans from rural communities. To enhance student retention and completion, the project is embedding proven successful methods for engaging student cohorts throughout the curriculum and college experience. The project is using formative and summative efforts to document its impact on processing industries and to help urgent national calls to increase the number of workers entering Mechatronics-related careers."

Nationwide, few technician education programs offer specific credentials in plastics engineering technologies. To prepare technicians with the desired knowledge and skills, Central Community College will partner with industry to develop and deliver the first certificate program in plastics engineering technology in Nebraska. The college will also use the new coursework to enhance its associate degree program in advanced manufacturing. The enhanced advanced manufacturing program will be designed to include pathways to help existing workers, underrepresented minorities, and veterans obtain the skills needed for jobs in plastics-related manufacturing. The project will therefore help strengthen the manufacturing workforce in this technology area for Nebraska and the nation.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to increase the number of qualified technicians with skills in plastics engineering technology to meet the increasing workforce demands. The proposed curriculum in plastics engineering technology will emphasize the operation of injection molding presses, knowledge about implementing molding techniques, and improving the quality and productivity of molding processes. The project will gather input from a Business and Industry Leadership Team to ensure that the developed curriculum incorporates industry-relevant skills. The identified skills will be used as the foundation in creating four new courses on plastics engineering. These courses will be integrated into the existing advanced manufacturing degree program, and also lead to a stand-alone certificate in plastics engineering technology. A Plastics Technology Learning Laboratory will also be established. This facility will incorporate state-of-the-art equipment to promote student learning through authentic, hands-on problems in a work-like setting. Alternative course scheduling options for the curriculum, including short-term intensive workshops or courses, will be offered to increase accessibility to students, including incumbent workers and veterans. The project will also develop opportunities for existing workers or other potential students to receive credit for their existing knowledge, skills, or experience. This credit for prior learning could be applied toward the certificate or the associate degree. The project evaluation will investigate the influence of alternative scheduling and credit for prior learning within the advanced manufacturing program as well as document the project's effect on increasing the skills of technicians for the workplace. The curricular materials will be available on the project website and linked to other resource libraries for broad dissemination. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The course and the materials are aimed at students with only one term of calculus preparation and a strong interest in premedical studies. All course materials lead to modeling problems of current medical or ecological interest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The goal for the complete course is that students should be able to read the research literature after six weeks of instruction and conduct their own research. In addition the materials are being designed so that they may also be integrated into existing calculus courses. A formative evaluation of student responses at all three institutions ensures that the materials are revised to meet the needs of a diverse student body.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project is addressing the need to provide a mathematical biology experience to students who are not mathematics majors. Students who are preparing for a career in medicine are not always exposed to the tools required to read the professional literature in a critical way. These new materials seek to engage students with interesting and relevant modeling problems that allow them to integrate undergraduate research into their coursework. The combination of a compelling subject, an undergraduate research experience, and a dynamic interactive classroom experience serves as a useful prototype for the mathematical education of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The course and materials being developed in the project draw the attention of students to topics of current concern. Global heath issues, environmental issues, and the context in which these occur help students to understand that biology is about more than being in the laboratory, and that mathematics is about more than routine calculation. The collaborations between two and four-year institutions, between public and private institutions, and between biologists and mathematicians, allow these materials to serve a broad diversity of student populations."
