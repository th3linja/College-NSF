Through this center, SCC will coordinate and direct a comprehensive curriculum and educational materials development project for chemistry-based technician education. The new curriculum will be developed for associate degree programs with input from a national consortium of employed technicians, business and industry representatives, community college and high school instructors, university professors, and the American Chemical Society's National Voluntary Industry Standards project. A new curriculum will also be developed for those already employed as chemistry technicians following a comprehensive survey of as many employed technicians as can be reached nationally with the help of local alliances and the American Chemical Society's Division of Chemical Technicians. Both traditional and technologically advanced educational materials will be developed for all curriculum projects and published and/or distributed for the purpose of delivering the new curricula in a manner consistent with modern educational theories and systems. Workshops for the enhancement of high school and community college faculty will be held during the summers in cooperation with local industries. Topics of the workshops will center around the modern work place and associated instrumentation and technologies community colleges use in the training of technicians. Marketing of chemistry technology as a career will be addressed, with special attention given to underrepresented groups, To help the center achieve these goals, all chemistry technician training programs, their students and graduates, the business and industrial communities they serve, and the feeder high schools in their areas will be united into a national community college network centered at SCC. The entire project will be guided by a national advisory board and a s teering committee."

The center, which will be based at  the Southeast Community College in Lincoln Nebraska, will serve as  a national model for program and materials development, and will  serve as a clearinghouse for information critical to  chemistry-based technician education.  The working group for the  proposed NCE builds on the broad experience and national leadership  of its members and is comprehensively considering issues related to  the Center's development, including:  curriculum reform and  implementation, alliances with industry, direct transfer of credit  to four-year institutions, and ""2+2+2"" articulation.  During the planning period, the working group will be developing  the structural and programmatic basis to create a National Center  of Excellence at Southeast Community College which can take the  national lead in the development of a dynamic and cooperative  approach to chemistry-based technician education.  ***"

This project, entitled ""Assignment: Chemical Technology II"", or ACT-II, is continuing the work of the current NSF-supported project (DUE 9553674) awarded to SCC in 1995 (""Assignment: Chemical Technology - I, or ACT-I), in which the curriculum and student materials for the first-year chemistry course in these technology programs is targeted. The ACT-II project targets four major areas: 1) the laboratory program for the first-year chemistry course, 2) the analytical chemistry and organic/biochemistry courses, including laboratories, found in the second year of these programs, 3) multimedia materials to include world wide web supplements and CD-ROM materials, to complete the work already begun for the first-year course and to also address the second-year courses, 4) a distance learning component to assist in the training of incumbent chemistry technician in these topics. The curriculum and materials developed is being guided in part by the Voluntary Industry Skill Standards for the chemical process and bioscience industries, Good Laboratory and Management Practices (GLP and GMP), and safety and occupational health issues."

The purpose of the project is to further enhance chemical technology educational programs in 2-year colleges by building on two previous successful NSF/ATE projects, called ACT-I and ACT-II, which were also lead by SCC. The new project completes the development of analytical chemistry course work begun by this group in ACT-II and also addresses organic/biochemistry courses. The analytical and organic chemistry courses are considered extremely important for these programs because they embody the heart of chemical technology education in the United States and are the primary vehicle by which the American Chemical Society's Voluntary Industry Standards (VIS) will be implemented. The project utilizes the VIS heavily and generate a variety of useful nationally disseminated products for such education, including a number of modules and monographs covering topics appropriate to these courses, a series of innovative laboratory activities for students, two interactive multimedia programs on CD-ROM modeled after the popular I.O.N.S. concept utilized in the previous projects, distance education models for these courses, and model 2+2+2 articulation agreements. Methods to be utilized include the American Chemical Society's Gap Analysis, faculty enhancement and participation workshops and development institutes, and research to create and practice various distance education models. The partnership includes the DuPont Company, which has donated $50,000 in matching funds, and also a National Visiting Committee consisting of real-world chemistry technicians and others who have a stake in the outcomes."

To meet this need, this project is adapting and implementing cybersecurity curricula, strengthening the recruitment and retention of students in information technology (IT), and providing professional development in cybersecurity for educators and industry professionals.<br/><br/>By adapting curricula developed through CyberWatch, an ATE National Center of Excellence, the project is developing an associate degree that meets the requirements for transfer to four-year institutions. To ensure transferability and relevance, the curriculum incorporates standards required for the Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education-Two Year (CAE2Y) designation.<br/><br/>Incumbent IT workers often lack adequate training in cybersecurity. To fill this skills gap in the current workforce, the project team is collaborating with local employers to package credit-bearing curricula into a model online/blended training track culminating in a Certificate of Completion.<br/><br/>To produce more graduates for the high-demand, high-pay career pathways that IT and cybersecurity offer, the project is working to increase graduation rates in the college's Computer Information Technology program and is working to increase the number of women students, in particular, who enroll in the program. The project team is reviewing and modifying curricula to include active learning strategies, such as the ""flipped"" classroom, as a means to engage students, heighten learning, and improve retention. The project is also providing faculty with training on gender-inclusive practices to help overcome stereotypes that discourage women from pursuing careers in computing.<br/><br/>The project is collaborating with the Midwest Center for Information Technology (MCIT), an NSF ATE Regional Center of Excellence based in Omaha, NE, to provide professional development in cybersecurity to community college faculty, high school teachers, and industry representatives in a four-state region during MCIT's annual ""Working Connections"" conference.<br/><br/>Collaboration with MCIT and CyberWatch provides a means of nationally disseminating the project's new curricula and other models."
