According to projections from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, technicians are needed to fulfill growing demand in fields that require precision agriculture such as agriculture and food science, environmental science and protection, farm equipment mechanics and service, and land surveying and mapping. Jobs in precision agriculture require a unique combination of technical and agricultural expertise that is not widely available for secondary and college students. The gap between evolving industry need and existing training means that even incumbent workers must seek additional training or education in precision agriculture technologies and practices to acquire jobs and succeed in them. By offering a ladder of enhanced educational experiences to secondary students, two-year college students, and incumbent industry workers, Northeast Community College in Nebraska will educate a wide variety of agriculture workers in line with industry needs as it provides a robust education and training program to support the vital agricultural industry of Nebraska and the United States. A focus of the project is on increasing the number of women and individuals of Hispanic origin in precision agriculture, which will strengthen and diversify an emerging U.S. industry. The deliverables and best practices developed through the project will be disseminated in coordination with ATE Central, at websites reaching agriculture education communities, through regional agriculture and cultural events, and through agriculture education journals and conferences.<br/><br/>Due to the highly technical nature of precision agriculture jobs, the agriculture curriculum is often outdated and does not fully prepare students for available positions. Enhancing precision agriculture curriculum for two-year colleges and connecting this curriculum with secondary schools and incumbent worker education will dramatically improve the preparedness of technicians in a number of agricultural sectors. Faculty at Northeast Community College in Nebraska, collaborating with Erudite Ingenuity and consulting with local agriculture industry, will utilize the college's existing precision agriculture curriculum as the foundation for a more technology-enabled, data-driven, and experiential Associates of Applied Science (A.A.S.) degree program. Integration of emerging technologies and longitudinal farm data throughout the precision agriculture A.A.S. program will provide important opportunities for college students to engage in real-world farm scenarios, the processes of gathering and analyzing farm data, and deciding on informed action plans. In addition, after modularizing three core courses of the precision agriculture A.A.S. program, investigators will flexibly adapt the course modules for use in the secondary Intro Ag course and in Northeast's early college precision agriculture course(s) to encourage students to complete high school and seek college-level education. The course modules will also be the foundation of a series of credit-eligible workshops and hybrid courses for incumbent agriculture workers to support their productivity. Local secondary teachers will collaborate with the project team to co-develop and pilot a precision agriculture unit that could be used in the Introduction Ag course offered by all Nebraska agriculture education schools. Local industry representatives will provide input on program and curriculum design as members of Northeast's Precision Agriculture Program advisory committee. The project will support a full-time Precision Agriculture Training Associate that will contribute to the proposed educational activities and will facilitate relationships between Northeast Community College and the high schools and incumbent workforce in its service area. A formative and summative evaluation process will be employed to continuously enhance the project activities and provide opportunities for researching and evaluating the success of the project and deliverables."

The TANN Academy is working to increase the number and preparedness of electronics and information technology technicians by developing, implementing, evaluating, and disseminating a cost-effective model for educating highly skilled electronics and information technology specialists in sparsely populated, rural communities. <br/><br/>Building on a successful partnership that has spanned the last three years, as well as NECC's involvement in the Midwest Center for Information Technology (MCIT), an ATE regional IT center of excellence, the TANN Academy is creating a replicable model technician education program that includes the following features: articulated, seamless education from high school to community college to four-year college; joint delivery of technical courses in the community college setting for dual enrollment; coordinated student outreach and recruitment focusing especially on underrepresented populations (females and students of color); expanded work-based learning opportunities; and, shared teacher/faculty development opportunities. Through NECC's active participation in the MCIT, the project deliverables have immediate access to an established regional distribution system. Dissemination of the model also occurs through presentations at state, regional, and national workshops and conferences, the development and implementation of a project website, and through publication in refereed journals. <br/>"

The engineering field struggles to develop sufficient interest and sustained participation across underrepresented demographic groups including women and individuals from rural, Hispanic, or Native American origin. This project addresses the shortage of diverse students entering into engineering fields by developing a course to engage rural and underrepresented high school students in maker design and creativity and to determine best practices that attract and retain these students. It is critical to foster interest in engineering during formative years when students are deciding career paths. The College created a Fridays@Northeast program that targets high school seniors, offering them the opportunity to learn from College faculty in Northeast lab spaces and classrooms to earn early college credit. Using this platform, a Pre-Engineering Multidisciplinary Design course augmented with the incorporation of a maker design area is taught at two of the community college's campuses to high school students. A maker design area outfitted with a set of prototype and model development tools and equipment allows the students to conduct activities that increase problem-solving and creativity while the course dispels misconceptions and transforms careers in engineering into a tangible and viable option. Variability in the student diversity between the campuses, such as racial, ethnic, or rural/metropolitan origin, facilitates educational research to develop a theoretical explanation for the development of interest in engineering careers for students from diverse backgrounds. Researchers are investigating how the activities increase problem-solving and creativity experiences, and how they influence diverse high school student postsecondary career pathway selection into engineering and STEM related careers.<br/><br/>This project addresses the shortage of diverse students entering into engineering fields by creating a course that engages rural and underrepresented high school students in maker design and creativity and determines the best practices that attract and retain these students. The high school students are provided learning activities and career exploration that help them understand engineering design and creativity while earning college credit. Educational researchers work with instructors to collect data through a multi-phase mixed methods design to develop a theoretical explanation for the development of interest in engineering careers for students from diverse backgrounds. They collect baseline and relevant continuing data on student background, academic preparation, engineering perceptions, career interests, course engagement, and overall student experiences. This is accomplished through a combination of student assessments, interest inventories, recorded class sessions reviews, and in-person class visits. This research will create a theoretical explanation for the development of interest in engineering careers for students from underrepresented demographic groups including women and individuals from rural, Hispanic, or Native American origin. The theoretical models derived by the project will be shared in state-wide education conferences and nationally to secondary schools, post-secondary institutions, and industry at National Science Teachers Association and American Society for Engineering Education conferences. In addition, project materials including curriculum, technical reports, and de-identified linked supporting data will be shared with the larger STEM community at the University of Nebraska Lincoln's Digital Commons open access repository. To preserve data access, the de-identified dataset and study codebook will be submitted to the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research at the University of Michigan as public-use data files and will subsequently be created into substantive metadata. Overall, this project supports exploratory work on untested, but potentially transformative research that will create a theoretical explanation for the development of interest in engineering careers for students from underrepresented demographic groups and will advance understanding of the professional formation of engineers."
