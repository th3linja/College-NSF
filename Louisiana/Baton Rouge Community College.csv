"2021761","Statewide Conference on the Redesign of  Remedial Math Curriculum","DUE","IUSE","04/01/2020","03/26/2020","Dennis Taylor","LA","Baton Rouge Community College","Standard Grant","Karen Keene","03/31/2021","$49,971.00","","taylord@mybrcc.edu","201 Community College Dr.","Baton Rouge","LA","708064129","2252168723","EHR","1998","7556, 9150, 9178","$0.00","This project will serve the national need for improving college mathematics instruction so that more students graduate and can pursue STEM fields. As a first step, this project will organize a conference to gain insight into the implementation of corequisite mathematics courses.  Many institutions require students who don?t pass mathematics placement tests when they enter college to take remedial, non-credit courses, thus delaying their college progress.  An alternative is to provide students with corequisite mathematics courses while they take a college level mathematics course.  Considerable research shows that the corequisite course model can significantly increase the achievement and retention of students who traditionally do not do well in mathematics. The project will explore this topic by convening representatives from the mathematics departments of all 13 member colleges in the Louisiana Community and Technical College System.  At the conference, they will learn about implementing corequisite mathematics from experts at the Carnegie Math Pathways-West End at Baton Rouge Community College, which will facilitate the two-day conference. <br/><br/>The Conference has four specific aims:  explore options and trends in implementation of developmental and corequisite models for mathematics instruction; support institutional team building and sharing between the workshop participants; catalyze redesign of the remedial math curriculum at the participating colleges; and disseminate the corequisite model within the participating colleges' faculty and administrators. It is expected that increasing the corequisite model in mathematics will increase the graduation rate of students, as well as increase the number and diversity of students who pursue STEM careers.  This project is supported by the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: EHR Program that supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. This conference is aligned with the Engaged Learning track, which supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools. It is also aligned with the Institutional and Community Transformation track, which supports efforts to transform and improve STEM education across institutions of higher education and disciplinary communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One project outcome is to increase the number of BRCC AS/AAS E/CM graduates to 25 annually who have strong academic foundations for further E/CM study at LSU.  For LSU, the goal is to improve the overall 2nd-3rd year retention and ultimately the cumulative 6th year graduation rate in engineering by 2-3% annually to the current university average for all entering freshmen (59%). Grounded in the ""sense of community"" lessons learned from an earlier STEP project, the results of small group discussions with BRCC students and research-based educational practices, these goals are being met through the following actions:  1) designing and implementing a pre-engineering learning community at BRCC; 2) integrating supplemental instruction/academic support such as Peer Lead Team Learning (PLTL) in core STEM/Engineering courses at both institutions; 3) expanding faculty development opportunities and supporting faculty-student interaction/collaboration across institutions that improves student learning; 4) providing the environment and training necessary to develop mentoring relationships among students (particularly transfer students), faculty and practicing professional/industry partners; and 5) implementing  mechanisms for effective monitoring and continuous improvement. This project is serving as a model for STEM Student Success."

This project focuses on the critical need for professional development of biology faculty at post-secondary institutions throughout the state of Louisiana. A series of three faculty workshops (STAR Mini-institutes) are modeled on the National Academies Summer Institute (NASI) on Undergraduate Education in Biology and are designed to develop a community of biology faculty who are trained in scientific approaches to teaching. The two and a half day long mini-institutes are describing and modeling scientific teaching and methods to promote active learning, and introducing participants to the data supporting these approaches. Background information on how to align instruction and assessment, diversity of learning styles and students, and how to document teaching effectiveness is also being presented in the institutes. To obtain experience in implementing these instructional approaches, participants are being grouped based on their teaching interests. These teams are working together to develop ""teachable units"" that incorporate scientific teaching, include formative and summative assessments, and address how to present information to students with a diversity of learning styles and needs. Participants in the mini-institutes are sharing their experiences with other faculty at their institutions, and maintaining their involvement in the project through various mechanisms designed to continue their development and foster community.<br/><br/>The mini-institutes are directly impacting biology faculty on campuses across Louisiana, but the broader impact extends to the large number and diversity of students enrolled in biology courses at the thirty target institutions, including six HBCU's and a number of community colleges. Results of the project are being disseminated through regional and national meetings and through publication in peer-reviewed journals on science education.<br/>"

The Gulf States -- Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida -- are geographically, socially, and economically linked and have similar job needs for environmental and engineering related technicians.<br/><br/>Skilled technicians are needed for preserving and restoring coastal and wetland ecosystems; building levees and other containment structures for retaining water; building structures for offshore energy production and transport; rebuilding and repairing storm damaged infrastructure; facilitating shipping, logistics, and commerce at ports; cleaning up oil spills; implementing the designs of city planners; hurricane response and dredging.<br/><br/>The planning team and its advisory board combine the intellectual capacities and real world work experiences of leaders in industry, academia, and government. Participants contribute marine and engineering technical experience, administrative experience, knowledge of science, and educational leadership in preserving coastal and wetland ecosystems.<br/><br/>During the planning process the PI team is making site visits to successful ATE Centers with similar goals in order to determine the best organizational structure and to develop a strategic plan for the programs and activities of the new center.  They are forming regional partnerships with representatives of community and four-year colleges, high schools, business and industry, and federal and state agencies. To reduce duplication and align program components with industry standards and industry needs, they are reviewing existing associate degree programs in technician fields, identifying workforce skills and required knowledge sets, evaluating GIS, AutoCad, and related tools, investigating distance learning and making plans to integrate internships and field experiences in the new curriculum. Methods to recruit and retain underrepresented groups and high school students are being adapted from previously validated models and incorporated into the Center plan. <br/>"
