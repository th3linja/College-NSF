Chalona Connection to NSFNET Proposal No. NCR-9415245 Nunez request support from NSF for connection of their campus networks to LaChen and from there to SURAnet. SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the southeastern United States. It will provide operations management and information services and it will give Nunez Community College a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore innovative educational resources."

A panel of instructors evaluates each student's potential for success to complete the degree and selects participants. Selected participants receive tuition and books paid for by the grant. Students meet with the Computer Science Advisor/Mentor during the semester to monitor progress. Students also participate in a series of specialized workshops to help them with logic skills, job-seeking skills, and transferring to a 4 year university. The Mentoring Model and the series of specialized workshops are used to enhance the scholarship students' success rates. The workshops and mentoring skills provided to students receiving scholarships prepare them for either a satisfying career or entry into a 4-year institution."

The goal is to encourage eligible students to study CS, and help them find a desirable job upon completion of their Associate Degree or transfer to a four-year university to enter in a baccalaureate program. Selected participants receive tuition, books and fees paid for by the grant. In addition to the financial assistance, they meet with the CS Advisor/Mentor on a bi-monthly basis during the semester. This helps monitor their progress and assure their success in the program. A series of workshops, offered throughout the program, allow students to improve their problem solving skills, interviewing skills, job-hunting techniques, and writing a resume. Students also receive individualized support and peer mentoring as they move through the program."
