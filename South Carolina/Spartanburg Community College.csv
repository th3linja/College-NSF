To meet this need, community colleges must work collaboratively with industry to develop programs that can educate more workers with these skills. This project at Spartanburg Community College aims to decrease the shortage of skilled technicians trained in network/cybersecurity technology in the Upstate South Carolina region. The project's leadership team will include regional industry employers, with the goal of developing a networking/cybersecurity curriculum that meets the needs of area employers. To ensure that future IT workers keep up with new developments, Spartanburg Community College will enhance the current Associate of Applied Science in Information/Network Technology by adding cybersecurity components.  This addition can help prepare students for modern challenges facing network and cybersecurity professionals.  In addition, these network/cybersecurity skills will increase their competitiveness for IT technician jobs. Recruitment activities include giving high school members of Cyber Patriot teams an option to attend Spartanburg Community College to pursue a cybersecurity career.  In addition, undecided majors at the college will be encouraged to talk with faculty about career opportunities in networking/cybersecurity.  Finally, the co-principal investigators, who are both veterans, will work with veteran groups within the college and greater community. Many students in these groups are members of underserved populations, who could benefit from increased employment opportunities following completion of the enhanced networking/cybersecurity degree. The program model will be shared with other colleges and universities via conference presentations and through website updates.  This information has the potential to help small to mid-sized schools improve education for cybersecurity technicians, reach out to underserved populations, and meet industry demand.<br/><br/>The program will leverage the experience and knowledge of regional business leaders, who will serve as the Business and Industry Leadership Team.  The involvement of potential employers has the potential to enhance an existing educational model by including cybersecurity content.  Program activities include: 1) creating and expanding the Business and Industry Leadership Team; 2) aligning the existing AAS curriculum with industry needs by adding cybersecurity concepts to existing courses and developing two new cybersecurity courses; 3) providing faculty with professional development needed to teach the enhanced curriculum effectively; and 4) using recruitment and retention activities to reach out to populations that will benefit from expanded educational opportunities. Engaging in new processes with the Cyber Patriot program will allow the college to reach underserved populations. The project aims create an advanced Associate in Applied Science program in Information/Network Technology that uniquely serves the needs of upstate South Carolina.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to increase the recruitment, retention, academic success, and graduation rates of these students  who begin their academic path at community colleges and transfer into engineering and computing degree programs at four-year institutions.Over a five-year period, this project will provide scholarships to 316 transfer students to pursue bachelor's degrees in engineering or computing. A national challenge in STEM education is the low graduation rate of engineering students who transfer from community colleges to four-year institutions. One driver of this low success rate is the insufficient preparation of community college students for the cultural differences they will face at the four-year institution. In addition, the four-year institution often lacks social and academic support to help bridge this gap.  The project components include: 1) a scholarship program to financially support low-income, high-achieving transfer students; 2) an evidence-based mentorship and cohort building program that supports transfer success; and 3) a Ph.D. student traineeship program that includes training in teaching, mentoring, and education research. It is expected that the program will contribute to the quality and diversity of the national STEM workforce and increase understanding of what works to support success of transfer students.<br/><br/>In addition to providing scholarships to low-income, academically high-achieving transfer students, this project addresses the well-known hurdles for transfer students by implementing and assessing a cohort mentoring model based on evidence-based strategies including communities of practice and cognitive mentorship.  The program elements are designed to support transfer student enculturation in the university, as well as degree completion and placement in the industrial workforce.  The program will recruit and train ten Clemson STEM PhD students for careers in academia by engaging them in immersive experiences in teaching, mentoring, and applied educational research. This training will include a residency at the community college sites where they will: 1) co-teach engineering courses with community college faculty; 2) develop and lead a cohort of low-income community college students in a project-based Creative Inquiry course that will be a focus of applied educational research; and 3) return to Clemson with the developed cohort, thus helping to bridge the institutional gap.  The program will conduct rigorous internal and external educational assessment and program evaluation to identify key indicators of student success and to provide information that can be used to improve STEM education at other institutions. Results from this work will be broadly disseminated through digital outlets (e.g., e-newsletters; listservs), presentations at national conferences, and publications in peer-reviewed and trade journals to reach audiences ranging from higher education to low-income students with aspirations of excellence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
