Graduates of the program are being prepared to become engineering technology managers for local and regional industries. Community College partners include Greenville Technical College, Piedmont Technical College, Spartanburg Technical College, Tri-County Technical College and York Technical College. Areas within the BS degree include project management, contract management, engineering cost analysis and systems decision-making. Applicable technologies at the community colleges include Architectural, Civil, Construction, Electronics, Graphics, General, and Mechanical Engineering Technologies. <br/><br/>The degree has a cross-functional focus that integrates best business and technical practice with an applications-oriented approach. Curriculum is being developed collaboratively between all of the institutions in the collaboration to ensure a seamless block transfer of associate degree recipients to the BSETM program. The project is building institutional infrastructure and use of best practices to nurture students and insure satisfactory academic progress, program completion and transfer to the baccalaureate management program. Included is a bi-annual shared ""Advising Academy"" for all advisors and counselors in the collaboration, mentoring and mentor training, creating a cyber-advising system, a student success banquet and development of student honor societies. <br/><br/>The leadership team is engaging in an outreach program to high schools students, parents and teachers to increase the awareness of opportunities in engineering technology. The outreach effort is focusing on recruiting and retaining women and minority students. Students recruited to the program are being supported through a bridge program. An educational/occupational outlook and opportunity CD/DVD is being developed and distributed across the 17 northern counties of South Carolina."

Our model has emphasized the curriculum development and workplace preparedness needed by modern aircraft maintenance technology for local, state and national audiences. Our effort has brought together a multidisciplinary team including a two-year technical college, research university, high schools and industry. Our participants have expertise in aircraft maintenance technology education, VR, human/machine systems design, inspection and maintenance processes in aviation, asynchronous learning and curriculum assessment with demonstrable results from previous NSF, FAA and NASA grants. Moreover, we have had the resources of the Advanced Technology Systems Laboratory and Virtual Reality Eye Tracking Laboratory at our disposal. The industry partners contributed experienced practitioners, a diversity of inspection tasks and test beds for integrating our VR products. This innovative approach is the first effort to extend tested VR technology to the aircraft maintenance technology curriculum in a two-year college. Existing approaches have not been able to mimic accurately the complexity of the aircraft maintenance process, reporting limited transfer capabilities and student preparedness for the workplace. The outcome of our collective efforts have lead to the following: an innovative, high-impact model for curriculum application in aircraft maintenance technology for college students and industry employees; an increased workplace pool of aircraft maintenance technicians prepared for the transition from learning to workforce; recruiting and mentoring material to attract under-represented groups to aircraft maintenance technology; a program providing the use of VR technology as a pedagogical tool; and a national model for collaboration among research institutions, community colleges, industry and high schools. Most importantly, this effort has integrated deliverables from on-going research funded by NASA and FAA in the use of advanced technology and virtual reality to improve the aircraft inspection and maintenance processes."

The laboratory is a national resource for the use of high fidelity 3-D knowledge objects to train aircraft maintenance technology students. The project is developing and disseminating curriculum and education materials based on the ViSIns laboratory to support the training in non-destructive methods in aircraft inspection and maintenance training operations.  It also is providing professional development in the use and assessment of ViSIns for college teaching faculty members and in the use of virtual reality as a pedagogical tool for regional secondary school teachers.  In addition, the project is assessing the effectiveness of ViSIns in supporting inspection and maintenance training and the transferability of the training to on-the-job skills. The industry partners contribute experienced practitioners, a diversity of inspection tasks, and test beds for integrating the virtual reality products.  This effort is filling state and national needs for well-prepared students entering the aircraft maintenance industry, and it is providing a better understanding of the use of 3D knowledge objects as a pedagogical tool.  The evaluation effort, led by an outside evaluator, is using surveys from high school and community college students and from employers. Dissemination plans include presenting the material through project websites, faculty and teacher development workshops, journal publication, and conferences presentations at the aviation maintenance, FAA, and technician education meetings. The broader impacts include dissemination of the instructional materials and outreach."

The courses of focus are college algebra and statistics, two courses of great importance for the technical workforce. Three objectives are being accomplished: 1) revision of the mathematics curriculum, incorporating work-based experiences technology, an interactive learning environment, and traditional curriculum development activities; 2) expansion of faculty dialogue throughout the mathematics community (secondary, two- and four-year postsecondary); and 3) provision of faculty development opportunities to support collaborative teaching methodology, student engagement in learning, and curriculum development. Methods used to accomplish these objectives include: 1) interaction with local businesses and industries through site visits, shadowing, and internship opportunities; 2) participation in professional development activities to increase teamwork and interaction; 3) increase in understanding of learning styles, collaborative learning, and use of technology as a tool for problem-solving; and 4) team efforts to develop, pilot, refine, and implement new teaching methods, work-based problems, and student interaction. Diaries of math applications in the workplace are being kept by faculty participants as they visit, shadow, and intern with local businesses and industries. Teaching portfolios are being developed by faculty participants for dissemination, detailing the types of learning activities and methodologies introduced into classes, what was successful and why, and students' reactions."

This collegial approach will be facilitated by the use of computer workstations that will be utilized by groups of 5-7 students. A microscope/video system will be used to provide more effective instruction concerning the proper usage of microscopes. This system will enable faculty to illustrate, for the class as a whole, important techniques for understanding and mastering skills necessary for proper and effective microscope usage. A laser disk player/TV monitor system will also be utilized to fully integrate a system of study and reference during lecture and group time. This pedagogy incorporates the three elements of an exemplary biology program: an investigative laboratory; use of biological techniques; and use of computers. It also accommodates a variety of learning and teaching strategies, fosters critical thinking and problem solving, includes collaborative learning and fosters active student participation."
