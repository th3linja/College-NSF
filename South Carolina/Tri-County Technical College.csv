These applications and the implementation of new photonics developments requires technicians who understand how integrated systems operate and who can support engineers at all levels. The Alliance uses a variety of resources, including collaborations with institutions/organizations knowledgeable in photonics, past experiences in the design and implementation of SC's ATE Center of Excellence, etc., to focus on building the capacity for Upstate South Carolina to compete in drawing photonics research and development companies to the Upstate. Four objectives are identified: 1) to increase the awareness of photonics as a career choice at the high school level; 2) to increase faculty capacity to develop distance learning and remote laboratories for photonics courses; 3) to align photonics courses to existing engineering technology curricula through the development of a scope and sequence; and 4) adapt content materials developed at the Center for Organization Research and Development (CORD) with a problem-based emphasis and ready the material for distance learning. The design elements of this project address the need to focus on attracting diverse population groups to the photonics industry. This is particularly true in the high school awareness component. Lessons learned from the SC ATE Center of Excellence project are particularly beneficial in this initiative since recruitment of women and under-represented minorities are identified as one of four critical success factors. The Alliance will disseminate the results learned from these activities through presentations at national, regional, and state workshops and conferences."

The state-of-the- art laboratory will consist of a Hampden Instrumentation and Process Control System to include the four major instrumentation and control functions: flow, level, temperature, and pressure; plus computer interface, calibration, pneumatic utilities, and troubleshooting support modules. This allows the College's Industrial & Engineering Technology (I&ET) Division to move from a series of islands of expertise to an integrated approach enabling students to gain the broadened perspective required in today's high tech manufacturing marketplace. Curriculum reforms for the project include: (1) to develop and implement comprehensive automatic process control and instrumentation curriculum courses within the General Engineering Technology, Electronics Engineering Technology, and Industrial Electronics Technology programs; (2) to reconfigure course content in current I&ET and Business division offerings to reflect a multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary CIM approach; and (3) to develop process control and instrumentation curriculum modules which other academic disciplines, at both the post-secondary and secondary levels, will be able to draw upon for illustrative and/or hands-on applications. A clear connectivity between theory and real-world application will be achieved through this project."

The purpose of  the Center is to provide leadership toward reform for the state,  the south, and the nation in meeting the challenges of achieving  success in today's high-technology marketplace, specifically in the  areas of advanced science and engineering technology education.   The planning objectives are to design systemic approaches for  transforming technological education at the two-year college level  including the following five major components:  (1)  Teaching/Learning Reform; (2) Instructional Technology use; (3)  Faculty Development; (4) Collaboration among types of institutions;  and (5) Accountability and Dissemination.Partners include all the  two-year colleges in the state of South Carolina, Clemson  University, the South Carolina Department of Education, the Academy  for Education Development, the South Carolina State Systemic  Initiative, the South Carolina Tech Prep Consortium, and numerous  representatives from business and industry."

The basis for this project is that students must be actively involved in teaching themselves, and therefore require training to more effectively do so.<br/><br/>The ""Excellence Through Mathematics Communication and Collaboration"" project is providing such training. Students are assigned to ""Focus Teams"" of 4 students who are given a set of 10 projects to be completed outside of normal class time involving the soft skills of learning mathematics such as note-taking skills, homework techniques, test preparation skills, and other basic mathematical skills (i.e., organization, logic, notation, and the ability to communicate mathematics verbally.) Each project is a self-contained unit. Projects are being presented on videotape and include written instructions, team exercises, and reports to turn in. Students are held accountable for attendance and participation.<br/><br/>Outcomes from the project include (a) a set of 10 video-based projects along with written instructions, worksheets, and web components; (b) a guidebook with detailed instructions for faculty; (c) a pilot test of the project; (d) an evaluation/assessment plan for effectiveness of the project and a report of the results; and (e) dissemination of the project to the professional community."
