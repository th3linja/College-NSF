Most new students at Trident are required to take Intermediate Algebra because they lack adequate skills to take College Algebra. College Algebra is considered a 'gatekeeper"" course since it is a requirement for many of the other math and engineering courses offered at Trident. Class sizes and limited technology induce Trident to use a lecture based instructional method for Intermediate Algebra courses. The lecture-based approach does not meet the needs of the various learning styles and mathematical ability levels represented by Intermediate Algebra students, thus only one in two students pass the course.    The College is eliminating the current lecture-based approach used in Intermediate Algebra and creating a learning environment to improve student success in Intermediate Algebra and better preparing students for College Algebra. By redesigning the delivery, the project is addressing major areas of mathematical reform and creating a Mediated Learning Mathematics Lab supporting interactive algebra software.    The mediated learning environment allows students with diverse learning styles to learn the material according to their individual learning styles and mathematical ability levels. Faculty utilize small group cooperative learning activities to support instruction. Faculty use specific writing activities to solicit student feedback through software ""E-mail"" and ""on-line journal"" features. Instructors use these features, other software management tools and increased student-instructor interaction to monitor student and adjust instruction to address problem areas. Faculty are receiving extensive training to prepare them to teach this newly designed course.    Project deliverables include a project Implementation Manual to be used by Trident faculty and other colleges interested in implementing the reform course, and a student training manual: How to Succeed in College Mat h to help students understand and use learning strategies."

Implementation of this project will allow Trident to address three curriculum deficiencies: (1 ) Trident is unable to teach GPS surveying techniques to train surveyors to comply with recent South Carolina legislation mandates; (2) surveying students are often underprepared for employment because of the lack of GPS training; and (3) the existing equipment limits course content in surveying courses.  Introduction to GPS survey equipment is necessary for the education of students entering the civil engineering technology field since the two-year technical colleges are the main source of education and degrees which qualify students to become licensed land surveyors.  Through this project Trident Technical College will: revise curriculum in 3 existing civil engineering technology and civil engineering transfer courses to include the use of GPS surveying and mapping equipment; develop laboratory exercises that allow students to develop technical skills in utilizing GPS equipment and surveying software that prepares them for state mandated changes in surveying procedures; work with other technical colleges in the state to provide a flexible training program for students throughout the state interested in becoming registered land surveyors; and expand the introduction to surveying classes to the high school level including GPS and conventional surveying technology."

This project aims to increase the recruitment, retention, academic success, and graduation rates of these students  who begin their academic path at community colleges and transfer into engineering and computing degree programs at four-year institutions.Over a five-year period, this project will provide scholarships to 316 transfer students to pursue bachelor's degrees in engineering or computing. A national challenge in STEM education is the low graduation rate of engineering students who transfer from community colleges to four-year institutions. One driver of this low success rate is the insufficient preparation of community college students for the cultural differences they will face at the four-year institution. In addition, the four-year institution often lacks social and academic support to help bridge this gap.  The project components include: 1) a scholarship program to financially support low-income, high-achieving transfer students; 2) an evidence-based mentorship and cohort building program that supports transfer success; and 3) a Ph.D. student traineeship program that includes training in teaching, mentoring, and education research. It is expected that the program will contribute to the quality and diversity of the national STEM workforce and increase understanding of what works to support success of transfer students.<br/><br/>In addition to providing scholarships to low-income, academically high-achieving transfer students, this project addresses the well-known hurdles for transfer students by implementing and assessing a cohort mentoring model based on evidence-based strategies including communities of practice and cognitive mentorship.  The program elements are designed to support transfer student enculturation in the university, as well as degree completion and placement in the industrial workforce.  The program will recruit and train ten Clemson STEM PhD students for careers in academia by engaging them in immersive experiences in teaching, mentoring, and applied educational research. This training will include a residency at the community college sites where they will: 1) co-teach engineering courses with community college faculty; 2) develop and lead a cohort of low-income community college students in a project-based Creative Inquiry course that will be a focus of applied educational research; and 3) return to Clemson with the developed cohort, thus helping to bridge the institutional gap.  The program will conduct rigorous internal and external educational assessment and program evaluation to identify key indicators of student success and to provide information that can be used to improve STEM education at other institutions. Results from this work will be broadly disseminated through digital outlets (e.g., e-newsletters; listservs), presentations at national conferences, and publications in peer-reviewed and trade journals to reach audiences ranging from higher education to low-income students with aspirations of excellence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project provides an opportunity to  address two different, but equally important postsecondary  education issues.  The first is the lack of educational  opportunities available to environmental technicians in advanced  technologies.  A second, but equally important issue, is the lack  of environmental education available to students at the secondary  and postsecondary level of studies.  Curriculum activities will  include development of:  (1) a curriculum course in X-Ray  Fluorescence Analysis of Lead Based Paint and Building Materials;  (2) stand-alone laboratory experiments in analysis of lead in  drinking water, GIS applications in environmental assessment and  remediation, and gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer sugar analysis  identification of viable airborne organisms; and (3) environmental  applications for integration into math, science, and technology.   Opportunities for faculty enhancement will be provided through  internships with industrial partners, as well as participation in  conferences and workshops.  A curriculum work group, composed of  project part (industry, secondary and postsecondary educators) will  facilitate a comprehensive approach to materials development and  sharing of expertise.  A one-week faculty training institute will  be held in the second year of the project to disseminate course  materials and train instructor technologies.  A variety of  activities designed to increase career awareness in secondary and  postsecondary minority student populations are planned for both  years of the grant."

Students, using a robotic system, synthesize conventional welding theory and skills training with automated application. The robot, indexing fixture, and power sources, when integrated are capable of replicating the automated production welding processes found in industry.   The final project exposes students from welding, machine tool, computer-assisted design, automated manufacturing, computer-integrated manufacturing, and mechanical engineering technology programs to a realistic manufacturing exercise. Students use knowledge gained from their curricula as they work together in teams (manufacturing units) to develop and manufacture a product (project).   A project of this magnitude, involving teamwork, electronic communication, planning, and problem-solving is invaluable to students entering an industrial/manufacturing environment."
