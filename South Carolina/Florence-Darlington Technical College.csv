The United States needs a workforce with the right mix of skills to remain competitive while fostering greater innovations and boosting shared prosperity."" The Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program focuses on the education of the skilled technical workforce and supports two-year institutions of higher education (IHEs) in leadership roles to support this workforce sector. However, many two-year IHEs have not taken advantage of the ATE program. The Mentor-Connect-3 (M-C-3) project disseminates strategies and results that are useful to prospective grantees; provides unique resources to guide and, effectively engages those faculty and institutions underrepresented geographically and demographically in the ATE Program to develop future talent for STEM/technician education.<br/><br/>Mentor-Connect-3 (M-C-3) expands the successful model that was informed by an award-winning IBM global mentoring program. Mentoring, technical support and resources engage new two-year IHEs as ATE grantees for the improvement of technician education. To stimulate longer-term engagement with ATE, mentoring is provided for new grantees seeking a second, larger grant, and second-chance mentoring encourages and supports vulnerable community college faculty for whom a first or second proposal has been declined by NSF. The problem-based construct of Mentor-Connect technical assistance embeds leadership development. Peer mentoring will facilitate knowledge transfer and help prepare the next generation of community college faculty leaders in advanced technological education fields critical to economic development and national security. Proactive and targeted outreach draws diverse faculty and two-year IHEs into Mentor-Connect and the ATE Program. Florence-Darlington Technical College, in partnership with the American Association of Community Colleges(AACC), will implement M-C-3 with the following deliverables:<br/>(1) A regenerative mentoring system that broadens the impacts of the ATE Program through knowledge transfer and leadership development;<br/>(2) An increase in engagement with and submission of competitive first and second proposals from underserved colleges and underrepresented populations in the NSF/ATE Program; <br/>(3) Technical assistance and online resources for use by mentors, all prospective and current PIs, and NSF Program Officers;  <br/>(4) A cadre of new, diverse ATE Principal Investigators with leadership skills;<br/>(5) Well prepared, successful ATE PIs who serve as Mentor-Connect mentors; and, <br/>(6) Publication of long and short-term impacts on the ATE Program, faculty, and 2-yr. colleges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The center is initiating a sustainable process for transforming implicit know-how from mature ATE Centers and projects into explicit knowledge and tools to improve technician education, in part, through the adaptation of a successful business model developed by the National Dropout Prevention Center, Clemson University. The adaptations are linking educators to advice and evidence-based ""ATE Solutions"" to move ATE forward and minimize duplication of effort in technician education."

The primary goal of the project is to meet industry's current and future needs for engineering technicians by stepping up efforts to prepare high school students for college ET programs, reducing the number of credit hours required for associate degrees in ET, and specifically addressing the learning and financial needs of minority, female, and working students. Improved student learning of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is realized by (1) an expanded and continued use of an integrated, problem-based curricula developed by a previous ATE project, and (2) a new focus on relevant, smart, teaching that extends best practices to second-year ET students and reduces overall credit hours required for graduation. An image and marketing campaign is enhancing the status of ET careers and publicizing corporate sponsorship of ATE ET students. The project is also demonstrating academic value to the students and economic value to the employers of paid internships as early as the freshman and sophomore years. The outcomes of this project, supported by detailed evaluation research, are being widely disseminated through workshops, publications, presentations, and a web site in collaboration with the National Center for Engineering Technology Education.<br/><br/><br/>"

Appropriate field equipment is being purchased to                    support this diverse program. Projects involve individual and class             research with the steps of selecting a problem, literature review,              research procedure, data compilation, discussion of results,                    summary and conclusion. Research papers will be written and                     reported. This program allows students to experience the scientific             method directly through field research. This fosters the students'              interest in science, and their development of an understanding of               environmental science which will allow for wise environmental and               natural resource decisions. The college will contribute an amount               equal to the award."
