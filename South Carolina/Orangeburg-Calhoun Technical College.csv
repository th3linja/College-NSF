Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College aims to address this need in its region by enhancing the preparation of students for TDL technician careers. Courses in advanced manufacturing and TDL at the college will be expanded to include a simulation laboratory component. The simulations will include a set of modular real-world scenarios that combine the business, logistics, production, and security sides of automated manufacturing. Teams of students will use these problem-based simulations to interactively troubleshoot, find solutions, and review the process. This approach will use emerging simulation technologies to better prepare students for the changing workplace. The project will also introduce high school students to the types of job opportunities in these fields and education requirements for these positions. In addition, high school students will be able to enroll and obtain dual credit for the TDL-related courses. Recruitment efforts will focus on increasing the number of women and underrepresented minorities in the manufacturing workforce. <br/><br/>This project aims to prepare TDL technicians by exposing students to emerging simulation technologies in a multi-disciplinary work environment. Twelve interdisciplinary, real-world simulations will be developed in the areas of advanced manufacturing and TDL, with input from local industry partners. These simulations will be used to enhance existing courses at the institution. A simulation laboratory will be established using a small production line that is fully networked and equipped with several sensors. In conjunction with this system, a resource planning system will allow students to monitor production and control the business processes associated with the manufacturing and order fulfillment process. This integration is designed to provide students with the technical skills and disciplinary knowledge, as well as an understanding of the business side of manufacturing. A Middle College Pathway in TDL will be added so that high school students can obtain transferable credit for completing these courses. Workshops for postsecondary students and teachers will be conducted to promote awareness of career options and industry needs in advanced manufacturing and TDL technology areas. Outreach activities will include a focus on increasing participation of women and underrepresented minorities in these fields. The college location enables it to engage rural student populations in its advanced manufacturing training and outreach. The project aims to increase the number of skilled technicians and to strengthen the regional workforce by connecting supply chain issues, production applications, and network security in a coordinated program that emphasizes real-world simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To achieve this goal, the project team will implement a three-step plan focused on awareness, preparation, and career-readiness.  Within the region served by OCtech, interest in STEM careers and student achievement in STEM subjects lags behind the nation and behind many areas within the state of South Carolina. The five counties being targeted for this project are in the top six of South Carolina's forty-six (46) counties with the highest unemployment rates.  Efforts are being made to shore up the lagging economy in the area by recruiting a variety of high tech industries. These employers will need workers with knowledge and skills in STEM subjects, namely robotics and automated manufacturing (AM). Without a skilled workforce to offer, this region of South Carolina will fail to fulfill its potential role as a home to these much needed industries. In partnership with local industry and school districts, ATE-RAMP will help meet current and future workforce needs by attracting and engaging students from poor, rural communities who are not typically exposed to robotics, AM, and STEM career opportunities.  The partnering school districts have significant minority and female student populations.<br/><br/>The objectives of the project are to: (1) introduce opportunities for underrepresented groups to have access to programs involving robotics and AM; (2) provide dual credit courses in robotics and AM for high school students; and (3) expand the course offerings in the computer engineering curriculum at OCtech to include robotics and AM and share developed resources with other colleges.  These objectives will be met through activities including, but not limited to, hosting Vex Robotics teams, competitions, and summer camps for rural K-12 students, deploying traveling robotics and AM demonstrations, adding dual credit courses to the STEM Academy of the Middle College at OCtech, expanding capacity of existing courses to facilitate better hands-on experiences for students, and revising the Associate in Applied Science (AAS) in Engineering Technology to ensure that it produces technicians with marketable skills necessary to work in fields related to robotics and AM.  Achievement of desired goals will be determined by employing mixed methods that assess affective and cognitive outcomes using both quantitative and qualitative data.  The results will help build the knowledge base on promising practices for engaging students from underrepresented groups who live in poor, rural communities in STEM activities, technician programs, and in the workforce."

The partnership is a formal alliance of ten school districts; industry; a predominately minority technical college, a private Historically Black College or University (HBCU); and a publicly funded HBCU. The project also includes a State Department of Education (SDE) and the State Board for Technical and Comprehensive Education (SBTCE). <br/><br/>The stated goal of the partnership is to increase both the number and diversity of students who enter and complete associate degrees in existing and emerging science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) cluster disciplines. It  accomplishes the following objectives: (1) Increasing both the number and diversity of students entering associate degree programs in the computer engineering, instrumentation, and other engineering technology disciplines through the implementation and articulation of high school STEM cluster majors (programs of study); (2) Improving success rates and professional advancement opportunities for transitioning students from both high schools and industry through a formal articulated K-16 STEM career pathway and Bridge Program designed to provide transition courses in science, mathematics and engineering technology; (3) Improving postsecondary delivery of science, mathematics, and technology workplace skills, focusing on Mechatronics, Advanced Manufacturing, and Computer Technology; and (4) Improving employer satisfaction with graduates in core competencies and workplace skills. <br/><br/>The project is promoting access to STEM careers and provides courses for under prepared students, especially women and under represented minorities. Strategies include high school STEM career majors and STEM College Academies that build on national models, such as Project Lead the Way; middle school STEM exploration activities and summer camps, high school Individual Graduation Plans; program revision that includes secondary and postsecondary faculty and student cooperative projects and mentoring using a technology platform for remote equipment and process diagnostics and collaboration; faculty development; and broad industry involvement in curriculum development, internships and co-op opportunities, scholarships, and Foundation support."
