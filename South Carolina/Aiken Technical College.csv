Hydrogen energy technologies are moving out of the research lab and are rapidly becoming economically competitive solutions in niche markets such as backup power and utility vehicle applications. As hydrogen technologies are adopted on a wider basis, a technician base will be needed to support the manufacture, installation, and operation of these technologies. A strategic plan that fulfills the workforce training needs of all aspects of the hydrogen energy industry is needed. The planning effort focuses on developing and sustaining the Hydrogen Energy Technology (HET) workforce within the United States through the creation of a Center for Hydrogen Energy Technology. The project is anchored by a planning partnership between Aiken Technical College and Texas State Technical College-Waco, with participation of an extensive research and industry collaborative that includes the Savannah River National Lab, the Center for Hydrogen Research, industry, government, higher education, and K-12 school districts. The planning process for the Center unites regional and national industry, universities, federal research facilities, non-profit economic organizations, and two-year colleges to build a regional workforce with expertise in the generation, storage, and usage of hydrogen and efficient local usage of the energy produced by hydrogen fuels. A detailed strategic plan that outlines the workforce needs of the hydrogen energy technology industry by sector and identifies goals and milestones for the Center for Hydrogen Energy Technology is being produced."
