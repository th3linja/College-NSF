Each institution enrolls approximately 3,500 curricula students, with Horry-Georgetown enrolling over 325 students in the targeted curricula and York enrolling almost 250. At both institutions, over 50% of their enrollment receives PELL or other Federally subsidized support. <br/><br/>Each institution has nationally recognized advanced computer and engineering technology curricula that have a specific need (1) to assist academically prepared students to complete their two-year degree in the prescribed time. All of the participating programs are academically strenuous and require a full summer semester between the freshman and sophomore years. However, as community colleges with predominantly local/regional enrollments, many students to need to work during the summer. Through the implementation of the CSEMS grant, the Colleges are identifying up to forty (40) students of academic merit who are at risk of not completing their degree requirements due to financial need, and to support and insure their graduation. <br/><br/>(1) Computer, Electronic Engineering, and Civil Engineering Technologies at Horry-Georgetown, and Electrical Engineering, Engineering Graphics, Mechanical Engineering, and Computer Engineering Technologies at York. <br/>"

The experiments will reinforce classroom work in all facets of network design, installation, maintenance, and management. The laboratory equipment will allow us to build a wide variety of computer networking scenarios which represent the challenges faced in the science, industrial, and business world today. In addition to integrating computer networking concepts and laboratory exercises into the curriculum for computing majors, the project will lead to a Computer Network Operations Certificate for non-degree seeking students and others returning to enhance their workplace skills."

The project is supporting the Scholars with peer and faculty mentoring, engaging them in an active student chapter of the Association of Information Technology, providing child care for students with children at a child development center, supporting their academic progress in academic achievement centers, and developing partnerships and support systems with technology employers within their own discipline. The project is building upon the lessons learned from a previously awarded CSEMS project. Previous recipients, who are working in industry, are becoming role models by giving presentations and supporting current CSEMS recipients. <br/><br/>Departmental faculty within each of the three programs are providing an identification and referral process to improve retention, graduation and transfer rates of the scholars. Recruitment and retention efforts are specifically targeting underrepresented and non-traditional students through a federally funded Educational Talent Search program, TRIO programs that include an Upward Bound program, and a Program for Accelerated College Enrollment. <br/>"
