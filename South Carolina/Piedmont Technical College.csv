""Tweaking"" the mathematics program has not helped sufficiently. The problems seem to lie with an emphasis on number-crunching rather than application and meaning, problems and data lacking interest and relevance, and a teacher-driven pedagogy. This project is infusing parallel strands of activity across some 18 mathematics and 24 related science and technology courses, to place students, realistic applications, and the use of mathematics at the heart of learning. The Computer-Based Laboratory (CBL) system is being infused into 25 courses as a way both to bring math to life and to focus on analysis and use of data rather than on its calculation. With this technology, student teams are designing and implementing their own experiments, adjusting variables, raising and testing hypotheses, and seeing mathematics as a tool for inquiry and understanding, not a topic for memorization and rote processing. A dedicated mathematics computer lab allows for the introduction of Minitab statistical software. This application is shifting the focus from monotonous calculations and number crunching towards experimentation, hypotheses testing, use of real-world data sets, team assignments, and mathematical displays not now possible in our program. Cumulatively, these initiatives are being used by some 50 faculty in 300 sections of 40 different courses, affecting over 2,000 students over the two-year grant period. Dissemination focuses on internal and area groups as well as state and national conferences and associations, with a particular focus on the participants in South Carolina's 16-college ATE Center for Excellence."

Employers are eager to here people who can establish and maintain networks, set up and upgrade microcomputers and software, and troubleshoot problems arising from the interaction of hardware, software, and networks, and pay them well (an area average of over $32,000/year). Yet there is no program in the area to systematically train such technicians. This project will create a 39-credit, three-semester Microcomputer Service Technician Certificate which will efficiently and effectively move students from turn the computer on"" to ""set up, manage, and troubleshoot a network"". The thirteen courses (six new and seven modified) will equip students to: (a) install, configure, and troubleshoot operating systems; (b) install and replace cards, boards, and peripherals; (c) install, upgrade, and troubleshoot applications software; (d) establish, maintain, and upgrade microcomputer networks; (e) diagnose freestanding and networked microcomputer problems using standard diagnostic equipment and software; and (f3 develop and manage internet website. The coursework building on the capabilities of a 25-station dedicated microcomputer lab, will be highly interactive, with student projects ranging from assembling and disassembling basic rnicrocomputers through creating and operating ""mini-networks"" using multiple network software. The three strands of activity will focus on: microcomputer basics (e.g. operating systems, basic programming, and applications packages); internet basics (both programming and website development); and networking (including LAN service, support, and management). In keeping with the national need, proactive dissemination will target both internal and area audiences and regional and national groups."

This creates three urgent problems for Piedmont Technical College's MTT program (and many MTT programs): problems of quality (students can no longer measure reliably to expected tolerances), problems of complexity (current equipment cannot even measure some of the newly-important dimensions), and problems of quantity (traditional measurement to more precise tolerances takes too long, allowing fewer rather than more such activities of our students). The Objective. To alleviate these problems through creation of a Precision Machining Measurement Center which contains fifteen pieces of equipment within five systems designed to measure linear, surface, angular, coordinate, and optical dimensions of machined products. The Methods. To redesign all seventeen current MTT courses (and add an 18th) to: (a) teach and reinforce application of this equipment in all courses; (b) redesign student projects to include explicit, graded in-process measurement of products (to supplement current end-process measurement); and (c) modify capstone courses to expect students to independently select and use appropriate measurement equipment. These activities will, in effect, add quality measurement to the curriculum's current emphasis on quality production. The Impact. Eight integrated activities will answer three questions: how much, and how, did the MTT instructional program, and with what impact? We will disseminate the PMMC model statewide through presentations, a report and the S.C. ATE Center for Excellence, and nationally through presentations and letters to the chairs of all 233 similar MTT programs."

One problem is that, as a result of 6 years of no state equipment funding, most of the courses (many of which are new) have only minimal equipment to support instruction and laboratory activities. This equipment is too scanty when science is proliferating and student knowledge and interest are declining. The other problem is that providing equal educational access to residents of six outlying counties requires delivering courses through distance-learning teleclassrooms. Off-campus students, however, lack access to science laboratories for laboratory experiments and procedures. The college seeks to develop the IDEALS system, which uses a combination of computers, internet, software, and broadcast technology to enrich each laboratory science course while providing off-campus students with fully effective laboratory experiences. The system matches computer software, Internet websites, and other resources with each learning objective and laboratory activity in 11 science courses. Content learning is enriched by graded assignments using these resources. Off-campus students use these resources to effectively emulate live laboratory activities. All students have the same laboratory reports, learning activities, and tests. Four biology and astronomy courses can be converted during the first 2 years, with the remaining seven courses converted during the following 18 months. Ten evaluative activities will answer three questions: the magnitude and the quality of these new learning activities and their impact on student learning. *"

It combines the investigators' experience in distance learning with their background in developing and implementing instructional strategies for promoting student success in engineering technology career pathways. The investigators are developing a template and instructional guide format for online laboratories that maximizes student learning.  Using this template and format, the project team is installing hardware and related software to allow virtual remote control of a set of expensive laboratory equipment.   To make the experience more realistic, the investigators are developing an affordable package of laboratory equipment that students can purchase and use at home to support interaction with the centrally located equipment.  They also are producing video instructions for the laboratory activities in 71 different on-line laboratory experiments and an on-line resource for dealing with frequently asked questions.  The project will provide remote access to on-campus laboratory equipment for on-line courses for students that maximize the potential for success of students with varying learning styles and hands-on learning needs. The laboratory model for distance learners is being disseminated via the South Carolina ATE National Resource Center, through a faculty workshop, and through conference presentations.  The evaluation effort is comparing course success rates, program graduation rates, student attitudes, and achieved competencies for students using the remote laboratory to those physically present in the laboratory."
