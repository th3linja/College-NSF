This project builds on the success of prior NSF funded scholarship programs.  The scholarship program targets academically talented students from rural areas whose high schools might not have the ability to offer the full complement of math and science courses.   The program offers a special remediation program to address any math and science deficiencies.  The scholars participate in the Math, Chemistry and Physics Preparation Program to provide the necessary skills to succeed in engineering degree programs.   This program also becomes the basis for a learning community.  Scholars also have the opportunity to participate in summer research and educational programs.  Student achievement is monitored at both the community college and the four-year institution where the students choose to complete their baccalaureate degree.   Approximately 70 scholarships are awarded during the life of this project."

This addresses four specific problems: (1) limited computer laboratory facilities, (2) low student success rates in precalculus and calculus, (3) low retention of students in mathematics classes, and (4) low enrollment and retention in related science and engineering courses. <br/><br/>The overall objective of this project is to make majoring in Science, Math, and Engineering (SME) more accessible through improved student learning in precalculus and calculus, thus empowering students to succeed when they transfer to four year institutions. To achieve this objective the mathematics faculty have established the following goals: (1) adaptation and implementation of exemplary educational materials, and proven techniques of previously funded National Science Foundation projects especially the Connected Curriculum Project and the University of Alabama Integrated Mathematics and Science Curriculum; and (2) establishment on one campus of a Mathematics Laboratory in which to use these new materials, thus creating an effective, interactive learning environment, which also provides Internet access for local students.<br/><br/>Activities include the following: (1) requiring all students in precalculus and the calculus sequence to enroll in a mathematics laboratory semester hour class designed to complete mathematics laboratory exercises; (2) enhancing faculty professional development by participation in the Duke University Connected Curriculum Project (CCP) workshops and by consultation with The University of Alabama to adopt and implement effective learning strategies; (3) developing of CCP modules in MATHCAD and MATLAB for use in the mathematics laboratory; (4) developing Internet courses; and (5) collaborating with faculty on other campuses of the college to initiate college wide reform of mathematics education."

In a simple analytic formulation or in simulation models, the rings result from a disk's turning bar perturbation. If the perturbation is not too strong, the disk gas clouds' motions are reduced to a damped harmonic oscillation about the circular orbit. Rings of luminous young stars occur via gentle cloud collisions which occur near oscillation resonances with the turning bar. The projected ring morphology of a galaxy plus radial velocity data can give the galaxy's three dimensional orientation, bar strength and pattern speed. <br/>Formation of stellar associations is promoted in rings where gas clouds are crowded near the end of<br/>the bar. As these associations orbit, they age as they move along the periodic orbits making up the rings. Age determinations are important for checking star formation<br/>models in other galaxies. <br/><br/>In this project, Drs. Tarsh Freeman and Gene Byrd will carefully model  Hubble Space Telescope observations of the galaxy NGC3081's inner and also outer rings, and they will theoretically investigate  NGC 4736 and NGC 1291, the two nearest resonance ring galaxies. Byrd and Freeman have successfully simulated the self-gravitational aggregation of ring gas clouds into ""associations"" near the ends of the inner ring of NGC3081. Larger clumps can be made to form by increasing the contribution of the gas cloud disk to the total centripetal acceleration (i.e. increasing disk gas surface mass density). Freeman and Byrd will extend these studies of the outer ring of NGC3081 and the rings of NGC 4736 and NGC 1291 to simulate formation of smaller associations, aging, and the importance of disk self-gravity relative to high velocity dispersion halo or disk components.<br/>***<br/>"

One type of ring, the inner resonance ring, appears in 76% of SBabSBc type galaxies. Thus rings are important in at least half of all spiral galaxies. Analytic studies and computer simulations of these rings will be carried out to see what they can also tell us about the pattern speeds of the bars and the disk/halo properties of galaxies. The latter are relevant to the dark matter problem. An analytic formulation permits determination of properties of resonance ring galaxies using basic observations of the rotation curve and an image of the galaxy. The disk gas clouds and stars' motion is reduced to a damped harmonic oscillation about a circular orbit. Rings occur near resonances of this oscillation with turning bars. Matching the analytic model to the morphology of the rings in a galaxy gives the galaxy's inclination, line of nodes, bar strength and pattern speed. Velocity data can also be used for more inclined galaxies. A variety of resonance ring galaxies will be modeled for which the data is available. Besides pattern speed and bar strength, we propose to use the matches to study whether four-fold resonances are important for outer as well as inner rings. Resonance rings appear to be a very good star formation laboratory. Star formation is promoted in rings when gas clouds are crowded near the end of the bar. As these stars orbit away from the bar, they age and their colors change. In contrast to difficulties in observing this effect across spiral arms, the change in color with increasing angle away from the bar is clear in the galaxy NGC 3081. Methods will be developed by using analytic theory and simulations to determine bar pattern speeds relative to the rotation curve. The change in color index with angle can thus be calibrated in years. This relation should be an alternative to and a test of theoretical color models versus ages in years of star formation complexes. These age determinations are important for star formation studies in other galaxies. ***"
