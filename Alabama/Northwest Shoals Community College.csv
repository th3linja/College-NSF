The Alabama Appalachian area the College serves contains significant numbers of needy students from underrepresented groups who are currently enrolled in math, engineering, and/or computer science degree and non-degree programs. Students are given financial assistance and opportunity to study in these fields, graduate with either a two-year terminal degree in these fields or transfer to four-year colleges to complete their degrees. A solid foundation of networking between the College and local employers is used as a base for mentoring scholars and for placing the trained students into a career related to their education."

We are targeting for our program students of all minority groups in the College's service area with special emphasis on populations of Native Americans and Hispanics. These students have been historically underrepresented in the STEM disciplines and we believe that a systematic approach to alleviate this problem is needed. Our specific objectives for the program include improving educational opportunities for minority students in the STEM disciplines, increasing retention of students to degree achievement, improving students support programs at our institution, and strengthening partnerships between secondary education institutions and postsecondary education within Northwest-Shoals Community College's service areas. The project consists of the following components: Recruitment and Selection, Student Needs Assessment, Support Services, Academic Achievement, Retention and Tracking, Career and Personal Counseling, Graduation, and Transfer. Specifically, the strategies for the program include outreach activities to encourage interest in STEM fields of study among minority students, use of state-of-the-art technological facilities for instruction, mentoring, student tutoring, offering developmental education, campus visits, professional seminars, and facilitating student transfer to four-year institutions. We believe that these activities would provide all STEP participants at NW-SCC a solid foundation to obtain academic and personal success and would help us to achieve our goal. The results from this project will be disseminated locally through campus publications, emails and professional meetings. We also plan to develop a website in order to disseminate the project's activities and results throughout the state and nationwide. <br/><br/><br/>"
