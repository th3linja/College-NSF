Fredd Campus of Shelton State Community College, founded in 1963, is a small Historically Black College with a strong presence in West Alabama. This HBCU-UP program is designed as a result of a thorough needs assessment that was supported through the use of an HBCU-UP planning grant.<br/><br/>The proposed HBCU-UP project will establish a STEM institute on the C.A. Fredd campus of Shelton State Community College, which has an overall aim of strengthening current STEM programs. Six components comprise the Institute: i) high school component; ii) undergraduate student activities; iii) infusion of technology; iv) curricular enhancement; v) faculty development activities and vi) transition to four year college, and subsequently to graduate school. The implementation project is a continuum that begins with the high school component, strengthens the 2-year STEM curriculum at the college, and then encourage and facilitate entrance into 4-year STEM programs.<br/><br/>Activities that will be a part of the STEM Institute include: a six week, intensive High School Summer Institute for rising seniors, and incoming college freshmen; professional development for high school STEM teachers; well defined faculty-student mentoring supported by professional development activities for faculty; implementation of undergraduate student research and summer internships; technology enhancement in STEM courses; and course restructuring aimed at gatekeeper courses. The transition to four year institutions will be encouraged and enhanced by student participation in research with faculty from four year colleges and Ph.D. granting institutions. This is further facilitated by a statewide transfer articulation agreement within Alabama.<br/><br/>This comprehensive project is aimed at increasing the number of C.A. Fredd campus students successfully completing introductory and advanced DTEM courses, increase academic performance in these courses; increase the number of students participating in research and internship activities, and increase the number of students gaining admission to 4-year STEM degree programs."

Fredd State campus (which is designated as a Historically Black College and University) and the Martin campus.  Shelton State will implement a comprehensive analysis of the C.A. Fredd State campus' Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) educational programs as part of a planning process to develop a five-year Implementation Project proposal to HBCU-UP. <br/><br/>The planning grant will use a straight forward, sequential strategy using the basic scientific method: Hypothesize, Collect Data, Analyze Data, Identify Problems, Develop Solutions, and Create Plan of Action. The planning grant objectives include the: 1) Assessment of the present needs in STEM Courses by careful compilation and analysis of historic data; 2) Professional development of faculty to enhance their  knowledge of model STEM enhancement programs and their expertise in developing solutions for enhancing STEM programs at their campus; 3) Creation of plans to strengthen STEM resources including laboratories and technology; 4) Development of a curricula redesign and restructuring plan that will improve participation by minorities and close gaps from high schools to the community college and four year institutions; and 5) Development of a strategy that will enable the college to identify, recruit, and retain minority students in STEM majors and careers.  The planning grant will allow the institution to develop and enhance partnerships within the community to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the College in order to move towards growth and improvements in each STEM area.<br/>"

The reading apprenticeship pedagogy focusing on strengthening disciplinary science reading skills would address the academic developmental needs of entering community college students in west central Alabama, known as the Black Belt for the acute poverty, inadequate public education, poor health, and high unemployment that exists in the region. The critical thinking skill development pedagogy would change the focus from simply covering science content at the community college to fill gaps in student preparation to developing their critical thinking and reasoning to improve students' problem solving ability.  The project will contribute knowledge on what are effective approaches in teaching science in an HBCU community college specifically, and could generalize to other community colleges."

The curricula, proven to assist students in understanding physics concepts, enhances the physics laboratory at Shelton State Community College. The advantage of MBL is to stimulate students into actively engaging in their physics education. MBL promotes group learning by encouraging students to interact with each other while performing their laboratory projects. Active participation by the students enhances the efficiency of their learning. Microcomputer based laboratories are powerful learning tools enabling students to visualize the intricacies of physical phenomena. This project impacts five physics courses: calculus-based physics (two courses), non-calculus based physics (two courses) and physics for the non-science major (one course)."
