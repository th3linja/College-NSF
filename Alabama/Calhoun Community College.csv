In this study, government agencies, businesses and industries are contacted to determine to identify the common core of skills needed by visualization technicians and to determine future national trends in the skill levels needed. Two year colleges are contacted to determine what level of education is being offered and to share curricula. Information is also gathered at various conferences on visualization and related topics. A web page carries the information. The information is used to establish skill standards and curricula for community colleges educating technicians for these industries."

Objectives include increasing the number of members of under-represented groups majoring in CMT, increasing retention to degree completion, encouraging academic success through developing a learning community cohort with tutoring and mentoring, and enhancing partnerships with area industry and institutions of higher education to ensure increased transfer rates and employment opportunities for Scholars. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit.  A CMT Project Advisory Team comprised of faculty, staff, and industry representatives is responsible for recruiting eligible applicants, selecting scholars, ensuring their success through mentoring and access to support services, and providing guidance on maintaining and enhancing program activities.  College support provided to the scholars includes recruitment, advising, an array of student support services and career placement.  The scholars are part of an active learning community cohort designed to help them succeed as students and later as professionals.<br/> <br/>Broader Impacts.  The program is resulting in an overall increase in retention, graduation, and transfer rates of CMT students and increasing the numbers of students and graduates from underrepresented populations entering CMT careers.  The project has a long-term benefit to society by filling jobs in high demand areas and increasing the successful entry of women and minorities into these fields. <br/>"

For TEAMS scholars, who are majoring in Mathematics/Pre-engineering, Computer Information Systems, Biology, Biotechnology, Chemistry, Physics, Aerospace Technology or Process Technology, the program is providing numerous career awareness activities and developing a learning community cohort with enhanced tutoring, mentoring and additional student support services. Enhanced partnerships with area institutions of higher education and with industry are helping to ensure increased transfer rates and employment opportunities for the scholars. Major goals of the program are to increase by 5% each year the number of students majoring in STEM disciplines through intensive recruiting at local high schools and via web-based media, to increase transfer rates and employment opportunities for TEAMS scholars, and to contribute to the K-20 educational pipeline for preparing a qualified workforce for regional high growth/high demand biotechnology and nanotechnology industries."
