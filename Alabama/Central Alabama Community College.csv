The Open Laboratory expands the use of computers in mathematics and science classes and laboratories using an integrated four level instructional approach. The four levels of instruction include: (1) computer simulation, (2) data analysis and graphing,(3) data acquisition, and (4) construction of a computer interface device. This stepped approach is allowing students to become familiar with one level of computer use before proceeding to the next, more difficult level of instruction. Interactive video discs/software and conventional software, previously used as lecture demonstrations, are being used by individual students to enhance their laboratory experiences. Students are seeing how computer skills important in one subject area can be applied to and overlap with other disciplines. Russell Corporation, a local manufacturer, is matching the NSF grant in support of the project."

Straley","10/31/1996","$13,546.00","","nnicholson@cacc.edu","1675 Cherokee Road","Alexander City","AL","350100000","2562346346","EHR","7400","9267","$0.00","Students are utilizing the concepts of Calculus to solve applied problems in both Calculus and Physics. The instructional approaches are modeled after the methods developed by Priscilla Laws, Ron Thornton, Alan Van Heuvelan, David Maloney, and others, to teach Physics. The approaches also involve stressing the graphical, numerical, and analytical aspects of Calculus in keeping with the ideas forwarded by the Harvard Based Calculus Consortium. An important aspect of this method of teaching is a set of short, simple conceptual experiments whose outcomes are recorded and graphed in real-time by a computer. Concepts are first developed qualitatively using experiments and their graphs, then quantitatively through mathematical representation of physical phenomena, and finally with overview case study problems."
