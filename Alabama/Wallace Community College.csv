To meet this challenge, 16 two-year colleges have formed the Alabama College System Microelectronics Consortium in partnership with the Economic Development Partnership of Alabama (EDPA). EDPA is an alliance of 67 leading business and industry companies committed to supporting quality economic growth in the state. Traditional engineering, electronics, telecommunications and manufacturing programs are not  adequate to prepare students for occupations in the high performance workplace of the future. The shortage of highly trained engineering technicians impacts the state's ability to keep its existing industries competitive and to attract new industry to the state. Community and technical colleges must play a major role in eliminating the shortage of highly trained technicians in response to current and future industry needs. However, the cost of advanced engineering-related programs limits the ability of any one college to effectively meet the demands of a rapidly changing workplace.<br/><br/>The ACETEA Consortium (Alabama Colleges for Engineering Technology Educational<br/>Advancement) is a joint effort of two-year colleges and engineering technology employers from throughout Alabama. The Consortium's purpose is providing a statewide approach to the preparation (education and training) of technicians in both traditional and specialized fields of engineering technology. Through innovative and flexible strategies, the Consortium is educating and training the work force for new, electronic based, advanced engineering technology fields. These fields include electromechanical automation (robotics), electronic manufacturing, instrumentation/data acquisition, aerospace electronics, informational technology, networking (WAN & LAN), and computer maintenance. The ACETEA Consortium is developing advanced engineering technology programs that begin with a common core curriculum in engineering technology. Each college is offering two to five advanced technology specialties that match the needs of industry in its region of the state. This regional approach is resulting in a statewide upgrade of current science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) curriculum; enabling colleges to grow with industry and meet the future needs of the high performance workplace; providing upgrade training to current industry employees; strengthening engineering technology education throughout the state at the secondary, associate degree, and baccalaureate level; nurturing new teaching methodologies in the classroom, laboratory, and workplace; and attracting many students to engineering technology programs including low-income, minority and other underrepresented groups.<br/>"

This project at Lurleen B. Wallace Community College (LBW) in rural South Alabama, which is designed to enhance energy efficiency, will have a widespread impact by meeting the needs of students, educators, and regional employers. The primary goal of the project is to meet emerging needs for increased energy efficiency by improving the quality of technician education in Industrial Electronics and Diesel and Heavy Equipment Mechanics. Faculty will actively recruit diverse student groups including veterans and other non-traditional groups to programs through career fairs, campus visits, and visits to military installations.  The program responds to industry demands as graduates of the Industrial Electronics program will have experience with Siemens Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), which are widely used in industry for their efficiency and scalability. Graduates of the Diesel and Mechanics program with preparation on natural gas engines will serve employers not only on offshore rigs, but also in the transportation industry with fleet vehicles and local and regional carriers. Diesel technicians who have experience with these engines are integral to the continued growth and evolution of the natural gas industry. By better preparing program graduates and providing instructional resources for classroom integration, the college will advance technician education in the diesel and electronics fields.<br/><br/>The college plans to meet its project goals through professional development for faculty, to include instruction in natural-gas engines and Siemens components, and through respective curriculum revisions that will ensure graduates are more fully prepared for the workforce. Students enrolled in the Industrial Electronics and Diesel and Heavy Equipment Mechanics programs will receive an enhanced curriculum taught by instructors who have participated in extensive professional development in their fields. The inclusion in the curriculum of instruction on natural gas engines will assure that the enhanced programs meet the needs of employers as these additions respond directly to industry demands. Technicians with this additional knowledge will be more flexible and better able to respond to the developments in their field. During the professional development phase of the project, faculty will participate in rigorous industry training and gain the knowledge and expertise needed to master emerging trends, expand their technical programs, and meet workforce demands. During the curriculum revision phase, faculty will collaborate with one another, the Dean of Applied Technologies, their technical advisory committees, and state-wide curriculum development committees to ensure the creation of well-developed course objectives, activities, and student learning outcomes. The programs will include additional mathematics and science courses, and more mathematics and science will be integrated into the technical courses.  Extensive assessment of student learning will ensure that students are graduating with the knowledge and skills required to be successful in their field. Articulation agreements are in place with two universities for students who wish to continue their educations."

This partnership generates new talent in the instrumentation and control subsections of nuclear technology. Southern Nuclear Company has pointed to this skill as a key labor shortfall area. Project participants are undergoing professional development that results in an improved quality of education and training received by students. The new and existing courses at WCC are taught primarily by existing faculty with additional instruction from subject area experts from Plant Farley. WCC and partners are educating faculty in order to maintain a nationwide supply of highly qualified nuclear technicians. The project enhances the skill sets of instructors in disciplines related to nuclear technology. Existing courses and new courses are presently taught by faculty members who have a limited knowledge of the nuclear power industry. These instructors are being provided with industry related training so that they understand how the skills they are teaching are applied to the nuclear technology field."
