In the southeastern US, production of catfish contributes nearly $3.5 billion to each of the four major production states (Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi). Advances in aquaculture technologies during the last decade have further increased the productive capabilities of the US. Although aquaculture curricula exist, few secondary or two-year educational programs introduce students to the field of aquaculture and the potential career opportunities that exist within this industry. Of the existing programs, few provide students with those hands-on, laboratory experiences necessary to meet industry standards for skilled technicians. One goal of this project is to develop an educational partnership between Gadsden State Community College (GSCC) and three Alabama secondary schools in order to provide experiences in aquaculture sciences for high-potential students. Faculty from GSCC and Auburn University are providing technical expertise to secondary schools so they may set up and maintain demonstration aquaculture systems--mini-fish farms--in the schools. GSCC is also developing a partnership with Auburn University and local industry in Alabama to offer educational experiences in aquaculture sciences for secondary and two-year school students and secondary teachers. This partnership is introducing technical curricula in aquaculture technologies at secondary and two-year schools, (2) providing information to students about potential careers in aquaculture, and (3) giving students an opportunity to participate in the ""Intern and Learn"" program--which places students on working fish farms. The project's program methods and materials will be disseminated to other secondary and two-year schools in Alabama that have recently been encouraged by the aquaculture industry to begin aquaculture programs."

Technological advances in recent years are changing Alabama's manufacturing industry. The number of jobs for technicians in this advanced manufacturing industry is growing rapidly, and there is shortage of skilled workers to fill this need. To help meet this need, Gadsden State Community College will work with industry partners to develop an advanced industrial automation program to prepare a greater number of technicians skilled in the blend of mechanical, electrical, and computerized technologies - also known as ""mechatronics."" The new program will be designed to provide students with the important knowledge and skills to operate, troubleshoot, repair, and make design changes to the kinds of equipment and operations that they would work with on the job. The program will also allow existing workers to upgrade their skills. This project will include activities that help to increase the interest of more female students in advanced technician careers. The Alabama Community College System will also promote the new program as a teaching model for other colleges to help fill the demand for skilled workers in Alabama and the nation.<br/><br/>The goal of this project will be to develop an advanced mechatronics program that has an integrated lab component to prepare highly-skilled technicians in advanced manufacturing. The curriculum will offer two new short-term programs leading to advanced certificates in Mechatronics and Robotics. The program will incorporate the innovative Mechatronics Laboratory comprised of an integrated and automated production line. The laboratory equipment consists of a line-based manufacturing system which integrates advanced programmable logic controllers, robotics, and electronics with the intelligent machines used in production. This line system will have the flexibility to be used as an entire production line for troubleshooting or divided into individual stations. This new approach to lab instruction will provide students with opportunities to learn integrated skills required for the workplace. The project will hold outreach events to enhance the interest and recruitment of females, high school students, as well as displaced or underemployed workers into mechatronics and robotics areas of the advanced manufacturing field. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In a planned Regional Center, faculty, through their interaction with industry, would become more knowledgeable and technically skilled. Students would have opportunities for hands-on experience with industry and, therefore, improve their intellectual capacity, while also comprehending the intricacies of the automotive industry and its manufacturing processes. These consequences would occur as the result of a stronger technology core and improved SMET education being offered in the State's two-year colleges. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/>The Consortium is developing and implementing activities that broadly impact the individual colleges, students and faculty, and the community as a whole. In a planned regional center, the level of automotive technical education would be raised to a level higher than that of the ordinary repair/mechanic programs.
