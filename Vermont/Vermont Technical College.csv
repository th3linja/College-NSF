It is increasing the pool and expertise of Vermont's IT technicians by changing information technology education and training network into a new model to meet future economic growth and development needs. Guided by a structured partnership of employers, secondary and postsecondary educators, and government agencies, the VTF3 project is developing a more flexible, responsive IT curriculum lattice model of self-contained education, training and work experience modules, recognized by both academic credit and industry skill standards certifications, that allows student flexibility to move across area specialties as well as to increase expertise in a given specialty.<br/>   VTF3 engages faculty and teachers in a faculty development effort to research and develop a new pedagogy to increase the motivation and retention of potential students. By focused attention to the recruitment and retention of women, minorities and students with disabilities, the VTF3 Project is broadening the base of the potential IT workforce.<br/>"

This new program prepares skilled technicians to provide rehabilitation engineering services to persons with disabilities -- from the design and manufacturing of assistive devices to working with people with disabilities in adapting their devices to the home and workplace. The objective of this design project will be to require students to utilize and/or modify available technology to design an environment which will improve the vocational opportunities and augment the daily living capabilities of a person with a disability. Thus, the goal of this proposal is to purchase a wide array of assistive devices in environmental control and computer access for students to use in an integrated, comprehensive, design experience. Working with vocational rehabilitation and users of assistive technology, the project director will develop a design problem for the students to solve. Student design projects will be evaluated and critiqued by persons with disabilities and rehabilitation professionals. The importance of such a project to the users of assistive technology is that by making assistive technology accessible and by integrating it into the user's environment, it expands the vocational potential of the user while improving the quality of life. The importance of such a project to the student is it expands their knowledge about all types of assistive devices, increases their problem solving skills, provides them with a comprehensive design experience, and provides them with the ability and knowledge to train users of assistive technology in the use of such equipment."

Two major concerns being addressed by the project are insufficient scientific preparedness of high school graduates entering two-year technical programs and the need for structured involvement of industrial and academic laboratories in the education of these technicians.<br/><br/>To address these concerns, the project is: <br/>a. aligning the secondary school requirements with post-secondary education biotechnology curriculum; <br/>b. familiarizing secondary teachers with current techniques in the field as they pertain to the high school curriculum; <br/>c. providing opportunities for high school classes to conduct laboratory exercises using materials and/or equipment unavailable in high school laboratories;<br/>d. developing summer courses for potential biotechnology students; <br/>e. involving academic and industrial partners in student training and curricula development; and<br/>f. ensuring access for groups underrepresented in this field.<br/><br/>The methods are improving science education at the secondary level, helping to satisfy the needs of industry and academic laboratories for qualified technicians, and broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in this field including women, persons with disabilities, and students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds in rural New England."
