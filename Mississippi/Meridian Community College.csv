Video exercises for the wet lab dissections and experiments and interactive multimedia stations (a combination of text, pictures, diagrams, animation, sounds, and linear video) develop and reinforce students' intuition and understanding of anatomic and physiologic principles. Equipment includes 30 TV/VCR/Headphone stations for the video-guided dissections and six multimedia workstations, each consisting of a Macintosh IIci and a Pioneer LD4200 Laserdisc player. The multimedia stations are networked to and managed by a faculty development/file server workstation consisting of a Macintosh IIci, Pioneer LD 4200 Laserdisc player, and an appropriate authoring program. Simulations and animations enhance the wet lab format with an emphasis on interaction."

These students are able to improve their intuition about the major underlying concepts and are dealing with more realistic applications of calculus. The institution will contribute an amount equal to the award."
