In this project a ""beneficial technology"" is defined as one that enables the student to successfully enter and keep pace with the current and future network technology workforce trends and that prepares the educator to enter the classroom and laboratory settings prepared to be the future education workforce and to teach the future workforce. The network technologies considered as emerging or future technologies have the following characteristics: (1) the education entities (secondary, two-year college, universities) targeted in this project lack sufficient knowledge of and experience in the technology, or (2) a current technology is in a constant state of change, thereby affecting information technology education and training within the education entities, or (3) new technologies that are on the ""leading edge."" Technologies that are being targeted as emerging technologies in this project are Client/Server, Internet/Intranet, and Multimedia utilizing computer networks. The mission of the project are being accomplished by the following goals and objectives: <br/><br/>Goal I. Identify and evaluate emerging network technology trends, applications, innovations, and curricula.<br/>Goal II. Disseminate to educators and their students emerging network technology trends, applications, innovations, and curricula. <br/> Goal III. Develop career education information and strategies to strongly promote interest by secondary and post-secondary students in computer network technology careers and the mathematics and sciences necessary for success in these careers. <br/>Goal IV. Ensure the participation by females and minorities in all career education components of the proposed Center thereby increasing their participation in the degree components. <br/>Goal V. Provide for the continued educational competency of secondary and post-secondary faculties and administrators who teach, implement, or administer curricula in emerging network technologies. <br/>Goal VI. Establish and facilitate an infrastructure to provide teacher internships and student work-based learning opportunities in emerging network technologies. <br/>Goal VII. Establish and facilitate an infrastructure to build a network of education, government and business entities that will support the development of quality programs that educate not only the future information technology workforce, but re-educates the present information technology workforce."

The level of intensity of these advanced network technology degree programs dictates that students in these programs devote a great deal of time to their studies. In addition, work-based learning experiences give students the necessary job experience to enter into the workforce and/or further their education. Full time faculty educated and trained by the SCANTE activities direct this project.<br/><br/>The project objectives are to:<br/>1. Increase the numbers of well educated and skilled employees in technical areas of national need by targeting recruitment efforts toward females, minorities, nontraditional students, and first-generation college students;<br/>2. Improve educational opportunities for students in the following disciplines: Advanced Computer Network Technology --- Local Area Networking, Wide Area Networking; Computer Programming; Internet Development Technologies; Computer Servicing Technology; and Telecommunications Technology;<br/>3. Increase retention of students to degree achievement (A.A.S. or an A.A. degree) by providing mentoring and work-based learning experiences;<br/>4. Increase success in transfer of students into baccalaureate degree programs by increasing the initial communication between the student and the faculty in the baccalaureate degree program;<br/>5. Improve student support programs through faculty, industry, and peer mentoring of students; successful student participation in work-based learning opportunities; on campus student seminars focusing on workplace behaviors, attitudes, and dress; and<br/>6. Strengthen partnerships between Jones County Junior College and the industries in the southeastern United States through participation of the industries in JCJC job fairs, work-based learning opportunities, mentoring of students, and the hiring of graduates; participation of industries in student field trips and presentations to student organizations.<br/>"

Teacher preparation is a significant element of this program. Many of the students of this program are future K-12 teachers. They will be well prepared to introduce, teach, and maintain information technology systems in the K-12 schools. This project will provide the foundation for a smooth transition from high school to community college in the field of information technology. The objectives that are designed to accomplish this purpose are as follows: 1. Establish an approved infrastructure to implement the training of secondary and post-secondary in local area networks and telecommunication networks. 2. Educate and train a core of 2-year college faculty who are qualified to implement an approved networking curriculum for technical students throughout the state and to utilize computer networks as instructional tools. 3. Educate and train a core of secondary faculty who are qualified to teach an networking curriculum for secondary students and to manage and utilize computer networks for instructional purposes. 4. Provide the training and resources to use the world wide web as a teaching and learning resource."
