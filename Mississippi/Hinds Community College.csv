The project at Hinds Community College-Utica seeks to build on previous successful efforts to facilitate students' transition from high school to community college to four year institutions and to increase their success rate in STEM disciplines. The goal is to assist students in navigating their educational path and to increase retention and graduation rates of students with STEM associate degrees. The project aims to specifically increase the placement of community college students into four-year institutions through academic partnerships with Jackson State University and Alcorn State University.  The project is expected to create a pathway model for student matriculation from community colleges to four-year degree granting institutions which can be adapted and scaled by other institutions of higher education.<br/><br/>The following activities and strategies are designed to meet the project's goals: development of the Summer STEM Academic Integrated Learning Program for high schools students in Copiah, Claiborne, Hinds, and Vicksburg-Warren counties; a College Success Camp for entering freshmen; development of a support and mentoring program to assist students with transfer and enrollment in a four-year university of their choice while providing them with summer research experiences at the Hinds Community College-Utica campus or at participating universities; establishment of faculty professional development programs to assist faculty in restructuring the learning environment and in building new collaborations.  A cyber-mentoring component will be established to continue providing support to graduates of the program once they transfer to a four-year program. The project strategies supporting these objectives are evidence-based and will be monitored and evaluated for effectiveness."

The anticipated strategy is to strengthen bridges that support students? articulation from high school to community college and from community college to degree-granting institutions in pursuit of a B.S. degree in STEM. This effort builds on an early unfunded needs assessment including a SACS self-study. HCC is working to identify specific components that need improvement in order to provide a high quality undergraduate STEM education to support students? articulation from HCC to degree-granting institutions in pursuit of a B.S. degree in STEM. Planned activities include: data collection and analysis, consultation with area schools and businesses, and site visits to model programs.<br/><br/>Hinds Community College (HCC), Utica Campus, is a small Historically Black Community College located in Hinds County, Mississippi. The HCC district has more than 10,700 credit students and is more than 50 percent minority. A strong STEM program and curriculum/professional development model can affect underrepresented minority students district-wide and serve as a model for the rest of the state."

The project at Hinds Community College-Utica Campus (UC3) seeks to establish strategies to strengthen interventions and instruction to enhance student performance of high school and college students in mathematics. Ninety-nine percent of the students on the Utica Campus are African-American, with 64% being first-generation college students and/or are from low socio-economic backgrounds. The project will contribute to the development of effective techniques by adding intrusive mathematics coaching to the developmental mathematics classes, outside STEM related experiences, and career exploration for college students. Effective techniques and approaches to be developed include providing ACT test preparation and state assessment boot-camps for high school/pre-college students. The project will also provide professional development for faculty, and include partnerships with industries and collaborations with 4-year HBCUs. Given the recognized and increasing importance of community colleges in the educational enterprise and ultimately the workforce, this project will contribute meaningfully to the knowledge base about the potential contributions and role of community colleges in developmental education, particularly mathematics.<br/> <br/>The overall goal of the project is to recruit, support, retain and prepare developmental students who are interested in STEM to accelerate through mathematics developmental courses in order to complete associate degrees and transfer to 4-year institutions. The objectives are to: (1) increase high school students' mathematics scores on state assessments, performance-based assessments and ACT/COMPASS; (2) increase developmental students' mathematics performance and passing rates in developmental math and college level math scores; (3) increase developmental students'knowledge and interest in STEM education and careers; and (4) create a dynamic math teaching and learning community that improves the performance of students in developmental and non-developmental math courses and which transforms the Hinds Community College-Utica Campus academic/educational environment. The project could serve as a national model to encourage other community colleges to intervene effectively and early in mathematics."

The overarching goal of the UC3T initiative is to more than double the number of students who complete work at HCC prepared to pursue B.S. degrees at four-year institutions by strengthening bridges that support students' matriculation from high school to community college and from community college to degree-granting institutions in pursuit of a B.S. degree in STEM. Jackson State University is forming an alliance to support students from the HCC district matriculating to JSU to pursue degrees STEM fields.<br/> <br/>The UC3T Initiative addresses a number of aspects of student and faculty development in STEM. Seven components comprise the UC3T initiative: (1) pedagogical transformations involving process education strategies, (2) faculty preparedness bridges, (3) cyber-institutional renewal, (4) seamless articulation, (5) joint academic bridges, (6) research experiences for undergraduates, and (7) the creation of a STEM community college science diversity center ? all designed to increase the enrollment, retention, and graduation and transfer rate of Utica Campus STEM students. These components were selected based on a comprehensive needs assessment including faculty and student surveys.<br/><br/>This project can serve as a national model to encourage student matriculation from community colleges to degree granting institutions."

This Hinds Community College project will involve junior and senior high school girls from four high schools from three Mississippi rural counties--Copiah, Claiborne, and Hinds--to participate in a summer apprenticeship program and other activities to increase their awareness about STEM and academic preparedness for a pathway to STEM related careers. The program will last three years and will engage up to 120 rising high school junior and senior female students intensively and introduce up to 300 female students to STEM education and careers. During the three year grant period, the project will implement the following activities: a four-week summer apprenticeship with a near-peer mentoring program; host an annual STEM Girls Rock Convocation; offer Spring Break STEM Tours for apprentices, their parents/caregivers and mentors, and Hinds Community College STEM instructors; offer after-school and Saturday science fair project assistance; and collaborate with the Shodor Foundation, a nonprofit research and education organization and a national resource for computational science education, to offer workshops for high school teachers, counselors and administrators.<br/><br/>The primary focus of the proposed project is to grow the pipeline of female students who are aware of STEM and computer science educational pathways and career opportunities. The goals of the project are to: 1) Provide evidence of engaging minority females in hands-on experiences in STEM-related technologies and practices; 2) Document evidence of advancing knowledge on how best to prepare minority females for STEM-related occupations; and 3) Build and expand the research foundation on STEM learning and learning environments, workforce development, and broadening participation in STEM. The project includes an infrastructure mechanism for teachers and administrators within the high school to support students by providing them opportunities to build their academic skills while participating in the project. A concurrent mixed methods research design will be used that combines quantitative and qualitative approaches to assess the latent variables."
