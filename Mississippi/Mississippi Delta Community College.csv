This region has traditionally been one of America's most prolific producers of cotton, rice, soybeans, and other major agricultural products. In the 90's, agricultural producers have faced one of the most severe depressions in American history. However, recent developments in plant pathology and availability of advanced technologies such as remote sensing, global positioning systems (GPS) and geographic information systems (GIS) have the potential to greatly improve agricultural productivity and enhance crop yields. The rapid application of science and information technology have dramatically changed the way producers, including farmers, bring their products to the marketplace. However, farmers remain reluctant to invest heavily in 'precision farming' without knowing that they will have a steady stream of highly qualified, technically proficient workers capable of utilizing the technology to make decisions.<br/><br/>Mississippi Delta Community College in collaboration with industry leaders, Mississippi State University, NASA, and the Delta Research Experiment Center are developing and implementing a curriculum in Spatial Information Systems (SIS) leading to the Associate <br/>degree. Through input from the training partners, the curriculum is being developed around <br/>short-term and long-term industry needs for an Advanced Agricultural Specialist. The SIS program is developing students' basic competencies, workplace values, and technological awareness, and competency through faculty and instructor enhancement internships, classroom experiences, and student internships. Articulation of curricula from two-year to four-year levels is also a project component. The curriculum is transferable to other community colleges with similar needs."
