The department is using a 14- inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, photometer, CCD imaging camera, video camera and conventional photography equipment. In addition, a planetarium and computers are being used for preparation for outdoor observations. The photometer is used to determine the lightcurves of variable stars. The astrometric capabilities of the CCD imaging camera allow students to determine the angular separation between objects. Students can also use the CCD imaging camera to plot the movement of objects (such as comets and asteroids) relative to the stars. The CCD camera also has photometric capability and allows students to measure changes in the brightness and structure of comets. The video camera is used to record and time occultations. The video camera also makes the telescope more accessible to visually and physically handicapped students. The college is housing the instruments in an existing domed observatory.The instruments allow students to participate in the entire scientific process, from the development of an observing program to the reduction and analysis of data. The department plans its observing programs in association with several amateur astronomical societies to which students may submit data and publications."

Instruments will be interfaced with a computer for data collection and analysis. Students will learn rates of conversions and will be able to investigate factors affecting these rates. The knowledge gained about methods and applications of instrumental analysis in biology will help to produce students better able to succeed in our nation's industrial and academic laboratories. The college will provide 50% matching funds."

These activities are improving students' understanding of cellular processes by giving students the opportunity to manipulate biochemical pathways operating in isolated organelles and to quantify the effects of this manipulation. In addition, the activities introduce students to tools and techniques commonly used in research, industrial, and medical laboratories."
