By utilizing video equipment in each lab, the instructor can instruct each student more effectively. The utilization of this equipment will provide a more effective laboratory learning experience for all biology students, by allowing the students to see microscopic specimens more clearly, see demonstration dissections more clearly, and will allow students to review procedures performed as many times as he/she wishes. The new equipment will also allow instructors to develop lab activities for students that are physically challenged."

A computer laboratory dedicated to the calculus sequence is being developed which is enhancing student intuition and allows for experiments in relation to underlying concepts. The calculus sequence is taught in the laboratory so that each student has immediate access to a computer and Computer Algebra System (CAS) to verify and experiment."
