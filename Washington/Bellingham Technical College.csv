Bellingham Technical College, in close collaboration with Western Washington University (WWU) and the Pacific Northwest Center of Excellence for Clean Energy (Center), is developing an Associate in Applied Science-Transfer Degree (AAS-T) in Sustainable Energy, which offers both preparation for technician level employment and the option of seamless transfer to a baccalaureate degree program at WWU. The jointly developed curriculum included in the Sustainable Energy Degree has enhanced general education requirements, including applied math and science courses that adequately prepare students to enter a university. A significant and novel feature of this program is the inclusion of specialized certificate options enabling graduates to enter the industry as trained technicians in several technical specializations. The AAS-T degree provides a significant opportunity to export the model to other states. <br/>This pathway model demonstrates a new way of offering training as well as a new way of teaching. Being offered at a 2-year open-door institution, this model provides new training opportunities for traditionally under-served community members. The college has a strong focus on serving nontraditional students and is working to increase the number of women entering advanced technology training. This degree offers new opportunities to obtain meaningful and applicable education and secure employment in a growing and well-paid career field.<br/><br/>To maximize regional workforce alignment with the educational experience, the Center is convening and facilitating industry focus groups from among their existing stakeholders to obtain targeted input on emerging fields in Sustainable Energy. Once compiled, the project will disseminate these industry-driven training standards by leveraging an energy careers web portal developed by the Center under a Department of Energy grant. This career lattice is already in use throughout a six-state region and the inclusion of this new material adds to its usefulness as well as serves a student and educator audience in Northwestern states.<br/><br/>There is an immediate and growing need for sustainable energy technological training at all levels. The college is a leader in technical education with a long-standing reputation for responding to industry needs by employing experienced technical experts as faculty and maintaining cutting edge applied learning labs. The partners provide expertise in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, research, and best practice dissemination and have established relationships with not only each other, but with industry leaders. The key team members for this project are experienced educators, researchers, and industry experts. Washington State has an interconnected two-year college system supported by the State Board of Community & Technical Colleges which encourages innovation and provides an efficient platform to share best practices.<br/>"

The program will provide scholarships, student support services, and help students develop positive identities and technical skills through the development of inclusive, maker-based learning (MBL) communities. Students, faculty and their industry and community partners will collaboratively design maker-based project sequences that integrate technology, innovation, and industry-based research projects into the student experience. Maker-based learning experiences are similar to traditional project-based learning experiences, but extend beyond the classroom through long-term project involvement and direct community connections. The MakerCETS project will provide scholarships for three cohorts of 12 low-income, academically talented students over the course of five years and will focus on connecting these 36 students to their peers and regional engineering technology communities.<br/><br/>The MakerCETS project will increase student access to STEM programs by providing financial assistance and academic support for Engineering Technology program students with the goals of increasing retention, graduation, and transfer rates and improving student workforce placement opportunities. This project will broaden participation in STEM through the development of student support and networking structures and the inclusion of maker-based work that has been shown to increase diversity and is especially attractive to women. Participants will engage in an MBL sequence, create individualized educational and career plans, build strong academic communities and workforce networks, have access to robust placement support services, and benefit from seamless transfer opportunities to BTC's new Baccalaureate of Applied Science in Engineering Technology and Western Washington University's College of Science & Engineering. Project staff will investigate the impact this maker-inspired, community building approach has on success rates and perceived self-efficacy for STEM students and use results to inform and disseminate the creation of an adaptable, replicable student engagement and support model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
