The renovated lab will support the shore-based analytical and modeling aspects of on-going field studies of the environmental monitoring by students and faculty of the Ocean Research College Academy (ORCA) at Everett Community College.  ORCA has pioneered a unique and effective research training program for high-school students, many of them from disadvantaged backgrounds or who are from groups under-represented in the sciences.  ORCA students learn first-hand, though inquiry-based, hands-on, research experiences that foster the questioning nature of science and how to use data to support ideas and hypotheses.  ORCA science focuses on environmental research and the monitoring of the northeastern arm of Puget Sound, a location local to the college and for which the local community has a high level of interest in preserving and understanding its present and future environmental functioning and vitality.  ORCA research involves monthly research expeditions aboard a local charter vessel that allows students to collect data and analyze trends in ocean chemistry, seabed composition, plankton diversity, and marine bird and marine mammal abundance and distribution.  The new facility will allow studies of CO2 and nutrient cycling in the Sound and their impact on its water chemistry and organism development to be realized.  Broader impacts of the newly renovated facility include enhancing infrastructure for science that fully integrates education and research for students from under-served populations engaged in carrying out environmental research of an important part of the Washington State coastline.  Additional impacts include improving facilities that serve ORCA faculty, most of whom are women, two of whom are of Native American descent, and all of whom serve as positive role models for students. The project also enables collection and publication of data that addresses environmental concerns in the Puget Sound area, includes student-driven public outreach that showcases research results and demonstrates the excitement of discovery through scientific investigation."

This need is particularly critical in jobs related to air passenger safety.  The number of technicians needed to do aircraft inspections, preventative and routine maintenance, and repairs greatly exceeds the number of students who choose an education in avionics and aviation maintenance. At the same time, young women in high school continue to be less likely than young men to choose to enter or to stay in career and technical education classes tied to these careers. This proposal aims to help meet the need for aerospace technicians by broadening participation in aerospace technician education.  To achieve this goal, Everett Community College will work with regional aerospace companies, local schools, and a national organization to train teachers and counselors how to equally encourage all students along an aerospace education pathway. A specific emphasis will be on encouraging female students, so that more stay in this pathway. The project will offer an education model that could be used by secondary schools and colleges across the country.<br/><br/>This project intends to improve the capability of educators, career counselors, and academic advisors to encourage students, particularly young women, to enter and persist in aerospace education pathways. To achieve this goal, the project will support a partnership between Everett Community College, aerospace companies (Boeing, Delta Airlines, and Glasair Aviation), middle and high schools (Everett Public School District, Marysville Public School District, and Mukilteo Public School District), and the National Girls Collaborative Project, which is dedicated to advancing best practices for engaging females in STEM-related careers. The project will offer training and summer institutes for educators and counselors, focused on equity-based and culturally-responsive teaching strategies. The relevant technical curriculum will be examined through the lens of equity and inclusion. The training will include teaching and professional development strategies that are known to improve the interest, retention, and achievement of young women. Educator learning communities will be created to support exchange of ideas, curriculum materials, and best practices. Each secondary-school partner will identify a project liaison to engage cohorts of female students in career-connected afterschool activities, courses, and events. Female role models in aerospace careers will participate in after-school activities and support the students' engagement with technical coursework. The project team will also work with industry to provide students with early exposure to typical technician careers, near-peer mentoring experiences, and other identity-building activities. The project will enhance understanding about how to increase the ability of educators and counselors to nurture young women by enhancing their technical confidence to pursue aerospace and related career pathways. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project at Everett Community College in Washington is guided by a desire to understand to what extent providing an intensive summer bridge program from high school to community college combined with high-touch student support services, including faculty mentoring, impacts the enrollment and success of low income students with promising academic talent.   The model draws from the evidence-based literature to create a holistic educational approach focused on student retention and completion outcomes in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields of study. Through targeted recruitment activities, the program will seek to increase STEM enrollments of underrepresented populations including women and students of color. In an effort to create an equitable access to education, the project will contribute to the knowledge base and investigate outcomes to understand if the program is working as expected, how it is working, and for what types of students. Through a comprehensive dissemination plan, the broader STEM community will benefit from a better understanding of when and why students are retained in or leave these programs, including those who successfully transfer on time or transfer before they graduate from community college<br/><br/>The program will combine a college readiness approach through an intensive summer bridge with student support strategies based on TRIO strategies to improve enrollment, retention, college success, and graduation or transfer. It will capitalize on the boost and immediate positive outcomes from summer bridge programs and couple the intervention to TRIO and related high-impact practices.  Summer bridge activities will focus on academic coursework gains and provide non-cognitive skill training related to different education conditions and fixed and growth mindsets to assure that beginning students have the tools needed to succeed in their fall classes. The STEM TRIO program provides additional support that includes strong transfer and career pathway planning, consistent check-ins to re-assess individual needs, and early warning for academic performance. All scholars are assigned to faculty mentors who assist the students to develop academic plans and meet with them regularly to review progress. Experiential learning (internships, special projects, and/or connection with professional organizations) is part of the pathway for all students. The project will engage 60 unduplicated STEM Scholars who are low income, high school seniors demonstrating promising academic talent and seek a degree in physics, chemistry, computer science, engineering or mathematics. A mixed method data collection plan will yield a rich set of results to improve the program intervention and the collegiate instructional experience and document student outcomes. Outcomes data will be disaggregated by groups (i.e., income, race/ethnicity, gender, first-generation status, and other defining characteristics) so that the leadership team, in concert with the internal researcher and external evaluator, can make informed decisions about the intervention, program improvements, and student outcomes and overall impact."

In each of these programs, students are encouraged to broaden their perspectives by taking electives from the different disciplines in the AAM program.   A twelve-credit Manufacturing Cycle Curriculum, leading to a certificate in Advanced Manufacturing Essentials, is to be developed.  The Curriculum, required of all AAM students, teaches them the full process and essential job duties of manufacturing from the design phase to quality assurance.  Students are expected to work on projects that can be feasibly produced in one program and be able to communicate the issues that occur during manufacturing to students in other disciplines.  In addition, the AAM faculty work with faculty in mathematics and English to create AAM-context based modules for developmental courses so that students are prepared for the technical courses.  In professional development workshops, high school and community college faculty develop modules to engage high school students in learning the STEM content needed for technical programs.  <br/><br/>The project funds career coaches to assist high school students and their parents to become aware of technical careers and pathways that include community college.  The project also funds a Navigator position to guide at-risk community college students to appropriate services.  The evaluation measures the effectiveness of these strategies to recruit, retain and place AAM students and determines their preparation for the requirements of the workplace.  <br/><br/>Worker productivity requires that workers not only have technical operation skills, but a broader understanding of how their task relates to both the quantity and quality of the final product.  Workers' knowledge of the full manufacturing cycle puts their work in context of not only what they do, but why they do it and how their work relates to the company's purpose.  The idea of the AAM program is to have the different departments work together to ensure that students understand the entire manufacturing and life cycle processes."

Through targeted, oceanographic research experiences with private and governmental collaborators during the summer that continues into the academic year, this project will increase the number of high school seniors professing an interest in pursuing a geoscience major in university. Research experiences are effective in attracting and retaining students in STEM fields, and this project seeks to embed collaboration and mentoring.  Mentoring for and by women increases the likelihood of changing the longstanding culture in STEM, where competition is valued over cooperation and collaboration. This approach enhances access for underserved students in STEM: women, students of color and low income students.<br/><br/>Through the deployment of remote monitoring CTD instrumentation and deliberate mentoring by the ORCA faculty/staff and practicing geoscientists from three different employment sectors during the summer, ten students annually will experience field work, monitoring instrumentation and management of the data stream. This experience will form the basis for students to generate further testable questions while receiving research support by the project team and scientific collaborators during the academic year along with financial support. Students will demonstrate their transition to independent researchers through showcasing their research at geoscience conferences, and regional events. Summer research experiences represent an effective mechanism to retain undergraduate students once they are in the STEM pipeline, but less understood is the impact a summer research experience has on high school seniors as a motivator for declaration of a specific STEM major. By providing exposure to all aspects of a geoscience career, with special attention given to the influence of collaboration, relationship building and mentoring, this project will contribute to an understanding of how to embed research into dual enrollment coursework and which aspects are the most impactful. This project also advances knowledge specific to the Puget Sound which remains an understudied estuary. Local understanding of complex systems is a result of in-situ deployments, which rarely provide the long-term data stream that this project will create. Recent, drastic temperature spikes in the area require year round monitoring. Engaging high school students underrepresented in geosciences in the hands-on deployment of real-time instruments, giving them access to utilize and distill the complicated data stream and share these data with others represents powerful, confidence building opportunities for students as they increase community connections. The broader impacts of this project will provide further opportunities for students to showcase their work, both locally, nationally, and internationally, building their confidence and the opportunity view themselves as scientists. Engaging dually enrolled students in authentic research optimizes the intent to maximize the personal involvement in creating new knowledge. Since data is telemetered live online, anyone has access to it. This provides pride of ownership by the students, who will then further engage in problems that require innovative solutions to benefit society as a whole.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In September 2012 the PULSE partners (HHMI, NIH, and NSF) appointed 40 Vision and Change Leadership Fellows to stimulate transformative changes in undergraduate life science education as recommended in the Vision and Change report. Fellows were selected from two-year colleges, liberal arts colleges, comprehensive universities and research universities. The Fellows have organized into working groups with the overarching goal of helping departments transform their programs in a national effort to increase student learning of core concepts, increase student retention in the sciences, and prepare all students to be more curious and scientifically literate citizens. <br/><br/>The current award is to begin testing a comprehensive set of rubrics developed by the Taking the Pulse Working Group.  The Vision and Change report contained a number of recommendations for improving undergraduate life sciences education but did not furnish an implementation strategy.  The rubrics that have been developed will serve as a blueprint for departments to evaluate their own progress in adopting recommendations in the areas of curriculum development, faculty support, student engagement and inclusivity, assessment, infrastructure, and the campus climate for change.  The working group also plans to pilot a certification program to both motivate departments to adopt Vision and Change recommendations and to reward departments that have enacted Vision and Change principles.  The initial draft set of rubrics has been posted on the www.pulsecommunity.org website under the provisional title: Taking the PULSE Vision and Change Rubrics 1.0 and rubrics will be updated as more departments field-test them at all institution types.  Results from the Taking the PULSE project will be posted on the PULSE website and shared with the life sciences community at professional meetings.  <br/><br/>This project is being funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to support Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education"

The inclusion of spectroscopy at all levels of chemistry classes encourages students to learn proper handling of scientific instruments for data collection early in their academic careers, developing analytical, problem solving, and critical thinking skills necessary for transfer to four-year institutions. The general chemistry and the non-major students learn to identify functional groups, differentiate between structural isomers, and determine product structures. Students in organic chemistry use these instruments for structure characterization of synthesized products, stereochemistry determination from coupling constants, and identification of unknown organic compounds. Above all, our students are developing the skills to relate theoretical concepts to practical observations with the inclusion of spectroscopy in the laboratory curriculum.
