This project at Spokane Community College will provide financial, academic, and professional support to 36 high achieving, low-income students, with emphasis on students from rural high schools.  The students will be enrolled in associate degree transfer programs in biology, chemistry, or earth science.  The need for more college graduates in STEM fields is well documented, yet many students who enter college interested in these subjects fail to graduate. In addition to providing financial support, this project will engage these students in activities designed to increase their success at Spokane Community College and matriculation to a four year college to pursue a bachelor's degree in STEM.   Activities will include dedicated academic advising, tutoring, peer and professional mentoring, undergraduate research, guided career exploration, and community service.  A collaboration with Washington State University College of Education will provide insight into effective interventions for increasing STEM student success rates, thus helping the project meet its goals.  This collaboration will also explore which approaches contribute to STEM student success at community and four year colleges. It is expected that this project will support students' academic goals and help to meet regional business and industry workforce needs.   <br/><br/>The project will use multiple strategies to improve the systemic recruitment of high achieving, low-income students and guide their successful completion of a two-year transfer college degree in the sciences. Scholarships provided through this project will provide the economic means for students to focus on their academic goals. These scholarships, in combination with advising/mentoring by STEM faculty and curricular/co-curricular supports will increase student success as measured by the scholars' persistence and completion of transfer degrees in biological sciences, chemistry, and earth science. Results of the program evaluation studies will provide insights to drive changes in institutional practice that will improve Spokane Community College's future success in recruiting academically talented low-income students and supporting completion of STEM transfer degrees. The knowledge acquired through this program will be disseminated through publications and presentations to further the national goal of increasing STEM student success, particularly among low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, rural schools have challenges in meeting performance benchmarks in STEM disciplines needed for geospatial careers, including technical careers in environmental and natural resources. The reasons for lower rural school STEM outcomes are complex. Cited factors for lower rural school performance in preparing students for STEM career pathways include a fewer number of experienced STEM teachers, fewer resources, and geographic isolation. This project explores the opportunity to better leverage community college resources to overcome barriers of geographic isolation.  Specifically, the project aims to expand the number of rural high school teachers with training in geospatial applications that are relevant to the region.  In addition, it aims to increase dual-credit (high-school and college) geospatial courses offered in rural communities. <br/><br/>This project will deliver geospatial professional development training to twelve high school teachers from four isolated rural school districts, with the potential to involve two additional districts. Three instructors from Spokane Community College who teach college-level courses in rural northeast Washington communities will join high school teachers as learners receiving professional development training, with the intent to expand the college's capacity to teach dual-credit courses on geospatial topics directly in rural communities. Over the course of the project, the PI and Co-PIs will deliver two 3-day workshops at one of five Spokane Community College rural (satellite) campus facilities. The participating high school teachers and rural college instructors will also receive additional resources to support independent exploration of geospatial tools, data, and applications for integration into their classroom teaching. These additional resources include the creation of locally relevant standards-mapped GIS learning activities for high school classrooms. Rural communities and industries can benefit from an expanded number of students who pursue STEM career pathways that prepare them for meaningful local job opportunities and support local workforce needs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The courses are being conducted entirely in  ""laboratory settings"".  About ten two-hour laboratory activities  are being designed for each one-credit course.  Course scheduling  varies as needed: it may be concentrated in a two to three week  period, or be spread over a whole quarter.  Up to five mini-courses  are being completed and test-run in an 18-month period.  These  include: fundamental concepts, nuclear, environmental, art, and  pharmacological applications of chemistry.  A comprehensive student  manual is being written for each mini-course.  This project takes  a significant step in turning away from the traditional lecture-lab  format of instruction to a student-centered, collaborative,  laboratory learning process in which the instructor is a guide and  a resource person, and the students actively engage in hands-on  exercises that are designed to trigger an appreciation and a  practical understanding of fundamental concepts of chemistry.  We  wish to attract, retain and educate those students who have  difficulty with introductory chemistry in conventional practice for  various reasons, by starting them with one mini-course at a time.   This innovation is being conducted in a community college with  extensive vocational programs and a high percentage of  nontraditional students.  As such it supports a national model for  promoting and implementing science education reform in settings not  adequately addressed currently."
