Since its opening in 1970, the college has offered comprehensive electronics and engineering technologies programs, along with technical specializations in biomedical technology, CAD for industrial applications, industrial power control, communications technology, digital computer electronics, and computer networking. To comply with the new standards developed for technicians by the American Electronics Association designed to raise skill and knowledge levels, faculty propose significant changes in the college's approach to technological education. Spanning a period of five years, 1995-2000, the project focuses on three major components: (1) Faculty Development. A rigormus faculty enhancement program is planned to prepare faculty for curricular reform. Participants in a summer institute in 1996 and 1997 will include electronics and engineering faculty, secondary school teachers, and representatives of industry. Building a foundation for preparing technical workers, the institute will cover a range of topics that include AEA standards, industry practices, collaborative approaches to teaching, use of interactive courseware, and competency-based instruction. The professional enhancement program also promotes faculty's return to industry for updating their knowledge and skills. (2) Curriculum and Instructional Materials. Comprehensive curricular reform requires development of Tech Prep career pathways in electronics and engineering technologies with Sea ttle Public Schools, pre-college level workshops in applied academics for students deficient in basic skills, integration of science and mathematics into technical programs, and new and revised curricula in electronics and engineering. Included in the project is faculty's collaboration with industry on training modules that can be used in the classroom as well as at the work site. These modules will focus on basic skills and on specific, typically complex technical topics such as object-oriented design and documentation. Faculty will also coordinate curricula for improving articulation between two- and four-year institutions and for establishing new degree options for NSCC's students. (3) Laboratory Improvement. Over the five-year period, faculty will integrate into the curriculum a new learning laboratory where automated work environments can be simulated and state-of-the-art systems demonstrated. The integrated systems laboratory will be designed to provide students with an overview of systems involved in taking a product from design and pattern layout to a tested and finished product."

The program emphasizes students' working collaboratively to apply concepts taught in physics and mathematics to the kinds of problems encountered in the engineering profession. The proposal entails the planning and integration of an interactive physics and calculus laboratory into the curriculum. By scheduling a daily three-hour block, the three faculty members in physics, calculus and engineering will integrate their course work in a two-quarter sequence which will provide students with 10 credits in calculus, 5 in engineering physics and 9 in engineering problems, statics and circuits. The program will be structured to accommodate students who need remediation in particular skills with learning assistance. It also will be designed to create a classroom climate that promotes the pursuit of careers in science and engineering among women and people of color. To bring such significant change to the curriculum, the three faculty investigators will devote time to curriculum research during the first of the two-year project. They will consult with two faculty experienced in developing an interdisciplinary program in science at The Evergreen State College, Olympia, WA; confer with Professor Denny Davis at Washington State University who developed a large- scale engineering curriculum project with DUE support, and visit model interdisciplinary programs in science and engineering being developed at other institutions. In developing collaborative, small group approaches to instruction, they will be guided by the expertise of the Washington Center for Improving the Quality of Undergraduate Education, a consortium of 42 colleges and universities that focus on learning communities as a means of reforming the undergraduate curriculum."

N3 is dedicated to collaborative efforts among regional institutions of education, local industries, and government laboratories to develop innovative educational and professional programs in nanotechnology, with a biotechnology emphasis, for faculty, secondary teachers, and students in the Northwest. <br/><br/>This work is building on a newly-developed Associate of Applied Science - Transfer (AAS-T) degree program in nanotechnology. N3 is directed at meeting the growing demand for a technically skilled workforce, and provides the framework for development and dissemination of much needed course curricula, class modules, faculty workshops, and other educational resources for community colleges, secondary schools and universities around the region and nation. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: In providing conceptual linkages among the biological, chemical, and physical sciences, nanotechnology is highly interdisciplinary and also underlies profound revolutions occurring within the boundaries of the traditional disciplines. This project is exploring the best ways of disseminating the body of knowledge generated from current nanoscale science and technology research to a broad student population in an effective and comprehensive manner.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: N3 has the potential to strengthen the foundation for a comprehensive nanotechnology program in the state of Washington. N3 can also infuse nanotechnology concepts into existing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses, and thus it can have a broad impact on many institutions and educational programs beyond nanotechnology."
