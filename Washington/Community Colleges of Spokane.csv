The project adjusts incoming students', enrolled students', and local employers' perceptions of IT technicians' ideal genders, skill sets, and degrees. The major activities are: (1) Offering IT summer camps for middle school girls, and professional development workshops for middle school teachers and counselors; (2) Teaching sections of science classes from the perspective of IT, and starting a chapter of American Women in Computing (AWS) on campus; and (3) Partnering with local employers to develop streamlined education-to-employment programs. The project increases the knowledge base of how to recruit and retain female students, and how to quickly make them post K-12 ready. It creates a curriculum that demonstrates interdependency between technology and science, and it develops procedures for establishing robust job shadowing and internship programs. The best practices established through this project can be extended to other STEM disciplines and technician training programs. Through a partnership with the Washington Center of Excellence for Information and Computing Technology; the project results will be available to instructors at all of the 34 community and technical colleges in that state. Through the ATE Mentor Connect program and the SC ATE Center, the results will be globally available on the SCATE.org and TeachingTechnician.org websites."

Teams of faculty and industry partners will develop real-world, interdisciplinary, industry-based sustainability problems that address recognized skills gaps in the current science and technology workforce. Interdisciplinary teams of teachers will complete online sustainability and systems thinking modules prior to integrating these concepts into problem-based learning communities. A summer workshop introducing problem-based learning and integrative interdisciplinary courses, industry partnerships and site visits, and a web-based support community will provide faculty with the resources to integrate sustainability into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) technical curricula. Instructional approaches will improve student performance and increase completion rates, particularly for underrepresented minorities, while fostering student interest in regional STEM technical careers. This project will provide a model for training green collar workers in regions that lack a well-defined green jobs subsector, yet are seeing growth in their green economy. Furthermore, the systems thinking approaches used in sustainability can be applied to many other problems in the workforce. Academic conferences and publications, combined with an established online presence via the Pacific Northwest Center for Excellence for Clean Energy (PNCECE), will help to disseminate these findings and to provide resources for training technicians for today's green economy."

The objectives of the project are to (1) recruit 48 high school and community college science teachers and 48 career counselors in the Spokane region to participate in a one- to two-week BEI Institute (Phase I), (2) recruit 16 Phase I teachers and their students for five-week, industry-directed biotechnology lab experiences (Phase II), (3) recruit 4 Phase II teachers for five-week industry internships (Phase III), (4) help teachers and counselors create a BEI Resource Guide that includes instructional materials, laboratory investigations, and career advising materials, (5) evaluate the program's effectiveness in enhancing teacher infusion of biotechnology into their curricula, raising teacher and counselor awareness of biotechnology careers, and improving student biotechnology content knowledge, career awareness, and attitudes, and (6) disseminate the BEI Resource Guide and BEI Model Program. The project is impacting an estimated 17,000 students. <br/>"
