"1700441","Meeting Industry Demands for an Immunobiotechnology-Capable Workforce through College and Secondary Technician Education","DUE","Advanced Tech Education Prog","06/01/2017","06/13/2017","Dina Kovarik","WA","Shoreline Community College","Standard Grant","Virginia Carter","08/31/2020","$572,070.00","Sandra Porter, Thomas Hamilton","dkovarik@shoreline.edu","16101 Greenwood Avenue North","Shoreline","WA","981335696","2065464696","EHR","7412","1032, 9178, SMET","$0.00","With an emphasis on two-year colleges, the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program focuses on the education of technicians for the high-technology fields that drive our nation's economy. Immunobiotechnology is one of the fastest growing disciplines in the field of biotechnology. Immunobiotechnology encompasses two main areas that are vital to modern medicine: developing drug and diagnostic methods that relate to the immune system and manufacturing therapeutic drugs derived from the immune system (for example, from antibodies). Jobs in immunobiotechnology require specialized expertise that is not widely available for secondary and college students. The gap between evolving industry needs and existing training means that even college graduates and incumbent industry workers must seek additional training or education in immunobiotechnology to acquire and/or succeed in these jobs. By offering enhanced educational experiences to students enrolled in two-year college degree- and certificate programs and connecting this curriculum with secondary school education, this project at Shoreline Community College in Washington will educate a wide variety of biotechnology workers in line with industry needs as it provides a robust education and training program to support the growing immunobiotechnology industry of Washington state and the United States. The deliverables and best practices developed through the project will be disseminated through coordination with Bio-Link (a National ATE Center for Biotechnology), at Life Sciences Teaching Resources Community website, in faculty and teacher development institutes hosted at Shoreline Community College and at Austin Community College, and through biology education journals and conferences.<br/><br/>Biotechnology is a dynamic industry, where continually changing methods and practices must be reflected in technician training and continuing education to ensure the emerging and incumbent workforce possesses current, high demand skills. Currently no other project in ATE's Bio-Link network offers a certificate or specialty training in immunobiotechnology. This project intends to fill this gap by creating portable courses in immunobiotechnology for use in degree and certificate programs by two-year colleges and kit-based instructional units that can be used by high school teachers in a variety of secondary biology courses. Investigators at Shoreline Community College in Washington state, collaborating with Digital World Biology and consulting with advisors from the region's biotechnology industry, will incorporate immunobiotechnology topics in multiple courses in the college's existing biotechnology program and will create new immunobiotechnology courses that respond to the emerging needs of local industry. New courses include Case Studies in Drug Development, Cancer Biology, Quality Systems, Advanced Bioinformatics, and two special projects courses providing independent research experiences for students. The new courses will serve as elective courses for current and future students enrolled in Shoreline's Biotechnology Associates of Applied Arts and Sciences (A.A.A.S.) Degree and Biotechnology Certificate programs. The new courses also comprise the core of a stackable Immunobiotech certificate aimed at graduates and incumbent industry workers seeking to update their knowledge and skills. The new immunobiotechnology courses will be disseminated to the broader biotechnology technician education community via the Bio-Link Course-in-a-Box(TM) feature. In addition, the project team will develop and pilot two high school level kit-based instructional units in immunobiotechnology  - Infectious Disease and Cancer Biology - to encourage secondary students to complete high school and seek college-level education. In the future these kits will be available to local teachers through Shoreline's existing Biotechnology Program kit loan program. The dissemination of the portable college-level courses and high school-level kits is likely to dramatically improve the preparedness of technicians in biotechnology nationally. A formative and summative evaluation process will be employed to continuously enhance the project activities and provide opportunities for researching and evaluating the success of the project and its deliverables."

By developing a curriculum that addresses industry-identified needs and contains job-specific experiences, the revitalized program will help students develop a skillset that prepares them for high-skill technology jobs in the field of clean energy. Currently, there is no national title for a clean energy technologist. However, Shoreline's industry advisory board has identified a need for such a position and this project will develop skill standards that align with industry needs. The ultimate results of this project will be expediting Shoreline graduates' placement into energy management jobs, and contributing new materials to the ATE community.<br/><br/>This project's goals are: 1) to identify and define skill standards for a Clean Energy Technologist curriculum using Job Task Analysis, Job Market Survey, focus groups, gap analysis, and Developing a Curriculum (DACUM); 2) to develop authentic field experiences that simulate authentic job-related activities through project-based laboratory experiences; and 3) to increase regional awareness and interest in clean energy technology by engaging with high school STEM teachers. Project evaluation will provide an outside, independent perspective on the effectiveness of the project. Project activities, measurements, instruments, and outcomes will be shared with other departments and schools through presentations and professional development activities, and through the ATE community."

The CME is working with its education partners to modularize manufacturing technology curriculum based on existing, regionally focused industry skill standards. Instruction is seamlessly combined for customization of instruction to students and incumbent workers, and leads to a degree. CME partner colleges and tech-prep programs are using CME modules in their manufacturing and engineering programs. Professional development activities are providing workshops for faculty on the design and use of the modularized curriculum system. The CME is also assisting high schools and colleges in promoting manufacturing career opportunities to students. Through its curriculum and professional development services, the CME is:<br/><br/>-- adapting and organizing already-developed instructional modules to form a manufacturing technology curriculum that is responsive to regional industry skill requirements;<br/><br/>-- developing a Teaching Factory model that develops skills by having students apply classroom instruction to real problems in a work-like setting;<br/><br/>-- training over 30 high school instructors, college faculty, and other instructors on how to utilize the modular curriculum system; and <br/><br/>-- improving curriculum articulation between high schools, community and technical colleges, and 4-year colleges and universities.<br/><br/>The long-term impact of the CME will be more and better skilled manufacturing technology graduates, improved technology instruction, articulation of the curriculum and enhanced coordination among secondary and post-secondary institutions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Each classroom has twelve computers, enabling a                     class of thirty-six students to work on projects in groups of                   three. Courses taught in these computer classrooms are being                    centered around problem solving teams that use the computers to                 do mathematics and to write reports that combine text with                      graphical and numerical output.  Students are becoming                          comfortable enough with the hardware and software so that they                  naturally and effortlessly use the computers as they think,                     discuss, and experiment. Daily access, rather than occasional                   trips to a lab, is allowing this to happen. The project is                      beginning in precalculus classes and then branching to                          intermediate algebra and calculus. With computers close at                      hand, faculty are fundamentally revising the way they teach                     mathematics."
