These resources upgrade the analytical capability in the general hazardous materials management program and in mixed chemical/nuclear waste characterization, storage, minimization, and disposal. The enhancements assist in the integration of the hazardous materials training curriculum with other on- campus analytical laboratories including chemistry, physics, engineering technology, computer science, and electronics. This development expands the practicum, hands-on experience in operation of hazardous materials field instrumentation, and in test methods and standards including safety, environmental remediation, and protection procedures and requirements."
