"1502032","The Pacific Northwest Photonics Technology Project","DUE","Advanced Tech Education Prog","07/01/2015","11/07/2016","Stephanie Bostwick","WA","Lake Washington Institute of Technology","Standard Grant","Virginia Carter","06/30/2019","$199,380.00","Mel Oyler, David Shannon, Scott Tromba, Kenneth Young","stephanie.bostwick@lwtech.edu","11605 132nd Avenue NE","Kirkland","WA","980348506","4257398156","EHR","7412","1032, 9178, SMET","$0.00","To address the needs of employers for highly skilled workers in the applications of photonics, Lake Washington Institute of Technology will partner with high-tech companies in the Pacific Northwest, the National Center for Optics and Photonics Education (OP-TEC), Fluke Corporation, the Center of Excellence for Aerospace and Advanced Manufacturing (COE), and the International Society for Optics and Photonics (SPIE) to produce associate degree photonics technicians for employment in the region. Photonics technology is the practical application of light, including lasers, and photonics plays a diverse role in regional economy, but labor market data and OP-TEC reports show a growing gap between industry needs and photonics technology graduates. This effort will create the only associate degree employer-validated, NSF-affiliated photonics program in Washington and the neighboring states of Oregon and Idaho. After building upon OP-TEC's highly-regarded curriculum and adapting it to regional needs and evaluating its impact, the college will disseminate the revised model and teaching strategies to other colleges in the Pacific Northwest using OP-TEC and SPIE networks as well as the Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges (SBCTC). <br/><br/>With industry collaboration, the college will develop this two-course photonics technology certificate to be added to advanced manufacturing Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degree programs. To support the goal of improving and diversifying the regional technical workforce, the project will develop a regionally-specific, application-based sequence culminating in a photonics certificate aligned with 21st Century Skill standards to meet specialty needs of employers in the Pacific Northwest.  It will utilize multiple recruiting efforts, including social media, to attract students and increase enrollment of previously underrepresented populations in photonics and advanced manufacturing and optimize and accelerate learning environments and career pathways to high-wage, in-demand jobs for students. This project will increase enrollments in photonics and advanced manufacturing at the college by engaging both traditional and non-traditional students as it seeks to enroll veterans, females, and older learners and create a more diverse workforce. Recruitment efforts will implement promising practices published by the Institute for Women in Trades, Technology and Science (IWITTS) and will contribute to the body of knowledge about recruiting and retaining underrepresented populations in technical programs at two-year institutions."

With more students attending full time, the college anticipates increased student retention, improved completion rates of degrees and certificates, and additional students transferring to a four-year university. These outcomes directly support national policy goals to improve post-high school education attainment.  Future Tech Stars will address the growing need for a skilled workforce to support the vibrant technology industry in the Greater Puget Sound region and as a result will lead to economic development for the Greater Puget Sound region and improved employment outcomes for students.<br/><br/>The three goals of the program will be to: support student retention to complete certificates within two years and associate's degrees within three years; increase the number of students receiving a Certificate or Associate's degree in an information technology, digital media, or computer networking technology program; and increase the number of students who transfer to a four-year college or university.  To support full-time students and to encourage the transition to full-time status, scholarship recipients will receive support from the program coordinator and from faculty who will provide dedicated support through writing workshops and advising. Through this work, this program will increase the body of knowledge around support services in scholarship programs, especially in programs targeting non-traditional students in technology programs. In terms of the broader impacts, the college will work closely with students and financial aid professionals to help them stay focused in studies.  The students will be tracked with an Academic Early Warning system to identify problems early on and seek to help the students take corrective action. The project will involve the whole campus, including the president, the PI, and individual students. Through an evaluation of the project, the program coordinators will provide information that can be used when disseminating the results of the project. As a member of the State Board for Community and Technical Colleges (SBCTC), LWTech will access SBCTC resources for use in dissemination of results at regional conferences, through their yearly fact book, and at quarterly statewide meetings of college staff associated with divisions such as Financial Aid, Institutional Research, and Instruction."

AppConnect NW will engage with information technology (IT) industry leaders, regional employers and local high school teachers and counselors to develop and support a technician pathway from an associate's degree to a Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) degree in Software Development. Data produced through AppConnect NW activities will inform states and community colleges that are creating new BAS degrees in software development. Best practices will be disseminated nationwide through the ATE network including college consortium collaboration strategies that meet industry expectations, curriculum development strategies that prepare under-served students with technical and soft skills to succeed in a competitive, fast-changing industry, and recruitment strategies that successfully support bringing under-served students into software development programs.<br/><br/>AppConnect NW serves the national interests by growing a diverse software development BAS student body, preparing the students to succeed upon graduation, and expanding regional recognition of an emerging applied degree. The project will educate and engage regional employers on the value of Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) degrees and BAS graduates to meet high-demand software development, programming and web development workforce needs in the greater Seattle area. AppConnect NW will create a professional network that brings together BAS software development faculty members and industry to develop, enhance and validate industry-relevant BAS technical training curriculum and standards ingrained with the philosophy that intelligence and talent are traits that can be fostered to achieve success rather than being inherited and static traits. This approach has the potential to enable non-traditional students to understand IT culture and thrive within the industry. Finally, the project will educate and engage local high school faculty and counselors to encourage students who would benefit from earning a bachelor's degree in software development at lower cost than a traditional computer science baccalaureate program and in a smaller-classroom setting. This project network will engage stakeholders in the pipeline from K12 through post-secondary education and industry to support student success in software development."
