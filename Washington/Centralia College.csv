The goal is to provide an experiential learning program for participants through a water quality research project. Project activities will center on a study of Salzer Creek, a tributary of the Chehalis River in Southwest Washington state. Students will calculate water quality, analyze soil samples, test samples of plants and benthic macroinvertebrates, and conduct stream flow analysis. Student research will yield data to be used in local water quality assessments for the Chehalis River Basin Council and to be entered in an international ecology data base."

The project is partnering with existing outreach programs at Centralia College to induce more middle and high school students to choose STEM careers. S-STEM scholars are working with peer and faculty mentors, visiting labs and field sites of STEM professionals, pursuing independent research opportunities and attending regional scientific conferences, visiting potential transfer institutions, and meeting with financial aid / admissions experts to ensure academic success. This project is increasing the visibility of STEM careers in a rural area that lacks role models in these areas. Many project activities are open to all Centralia College students, lifting the academic achievement of not only the S-STEM scholars, but also their classmates. The investment in S-STEM scholars is having a spillover effect on their classmates, on the visibility of STEM careers and education programs at the college, and on the viability of STEM careers to students in the community who might otherwise not attempt this path."

Interactive multi-media modules are being made available through a website and are accompanied by background material and guidelines for flexible use to instructor adoption. Students can measure tree-ring widths virtually and/or use datasets to conduct inquiry-based investigations and quantitative analyses, with an emphasis on learning the process of science. The project is also conducting faculty-development workshops at the partnering institutions, and undertaking rigorous evaluation of learning outcomes.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project lies in its innovative approach to leveraging the readily grasped basic premise and wide range of applicability of tree-ring science to engage students in learning scientific methods and quantitative reasoning. Broader impacts include infusion of tree-ring science in the undergraduate curriculum at the diverse partnering institutions and beyond. Skills and attitudes imparted by the modules both benefit students who go on in STEM and bolster scientific literacy among the general population."
