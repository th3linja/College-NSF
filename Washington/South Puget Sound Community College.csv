Specific activities include: (1) achieving accreditation from the National Institute for Metalworking Skills (NIMS) for the program; (2) providing professional development to lead faculty to ensure NIMS accreditation and a high-quality program; and (3) creating a flexible entry/exit system through a fully integrated CMT pathway for students with different educational and experiential backgrounds so they can achieve national certification in CMT-related areas. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project is providing a sound model through which accreditation and intensive industry input can help resolve workforce shortages in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) related technical and professional positions throughout the United States. It is addressing this at the local and state level through the strategic deployment of activities to streamline educational links with workforce outcomes. Of particular note are (1) the CMT pathway that is allowing students to individualize their education with distinct workforce outcomes that lead to jobs and (2) updated curricula to help ensure that what the college teaches is what employers need. The college has been actively involved in augmenting its CMT program over the past two years and is leveraging past work for short-term CMT training, building on new educational programs, and providing a programmatic and learning enrichment that is helping the state meet the demand for CMT careers in the future. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Because the project is advancing community college-level computerized manufacturing technology, computer numerical control, and pre-engineering programs, it has significance beyond local and statewide impact in the aerospace industry. Through its flexible pathway structure, the project is providing an innovative approach that allows the college to address educational and workforce needs of high school students, community college students, students returning to school, dislocated workers, and veterans. Accreditation is serving as a unifying force by assuring that all students are prepared for the increasingly demanding workplace CMT qualifications demanded by industry. Industry and other community partners are helping to broaden dissemination of CMT opportunities and ensuring that the program meets current industry expectations while faculty and others directly involved in the project are disseminating the effectiveness of the project through conferences and statewide meetings. The project represents a thoughtful, coordinated approach to benefit the entire State of Washington, including the Pacific/Mountain region, as the state works to rebuild its aerospace industry."
