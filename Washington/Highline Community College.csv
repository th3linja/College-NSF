Entitled ""Transitioning Learners to Calculus in Community Colleges"" (TLC3), the project will gather a team of higher education researchers, mathematicians, and mathematics educators to transform institutional approaches to identifying and remedying barriers that impede student progress to and through Calculus II in community colleges. A significant impact of TLC3 will involve supporting instructional improvements aimed at increasing the success of historically undeserved students, particularly underrepresented racial minority (URM) students, thus contributing ultimately to the diversity of the nation's STEM workforce. <br/><br/>The broader goal of TLC3 is to build and test theoretical models that predict STEM URM student success in the Developmental to Pre-calculus to Calculus II (DPC2) sequence, based on programs, structures, and instructional strategies in successful programs. The project uses a mixed-methods approach, including a census survey of 948 community colleges and case studies focused on minority-serving institutions. The models will inform the development of a change tool (i.e., the institutional self-assessment), that examines institutional readiness to facilitate successful outcomes for URM students in the DPC2 sequence. Five institutions selected from a TLC3 networked community (with a minimum of 50 institutions) will test the models and self-assessment tool. The institutional self-assessment tool will help identify a professional development approach that departments and institutions can use to remedy barriers that inhibit student success in the DPC2 sequence. This project is supported by NSF's Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program (IUSE) and the EHR Core Research (ECR) Program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field."

Nationally, 2YCs enroll over 45% of all U.S. undergraduates and serve a large number of women, minority, and first-generation college students. The 2YC teaching environment is one of the most challenging as community colleges are primarily open-access institutions that serve an extremely diverse student body; teaching loads are heavy; there is an increasing use of adjunct faculty; and support is limited for participation in faculty professional development activities. The latter issue is particularly crucial since such activities are widely recognized as the source for many innovative teaching methods shown to be critically important for improving student learning. This faculty professional development project will build a national network of self-sustaining local communities of 2YC geoscience faculty and administrators who use evidence-based strategies to improve all students' academic success and facilitate professional pathways into the STEM workforce. A program of interconnected and mutually supportive research and evaluation that is fully integrated in the project will advance knowledge and understanding of the effectiveness of a professional development model for full-time and adjunct geoscience and STEM faculty in 2YCs. <br/><br/>The project goals are to 1) implement high-impact evidence-based instructional and co-curricular practices that support the academic success of all students and promote professional pathways into geoscience; 2) build a sustainable national network of 2YC leaders who catalyze change at multiple levels from their courses to institutions in their local regions and within the community of practice; and 3) investigate models of professional development for full-time and adjunct 2YC geoscience faculty that promote the cycle of innovation, where faculty learn from the research of others, make changes in their own practice, and share what they have learned with the education community. The project's professional development program will prepare two cohorts of 2YC geoscience faculty teams to implement evidence-based instructional and co-curricular practices at their institutions. The first cohort includes twenty-four (24) full-time and adjunct faculty from seventeen (17) institutions in ten regions in the United States. National workshops, virtual professional development opportunities (e.g., journal clubs, webinars, implementation and discussion groups), and on-line resources will support faculty in implementing changes on their campus. Inclusion of administrators in the project will provide support for systemic change at each institution. The faculty teams will expand the reach of the project by engaging additional two-year and four-year institutions in their regions using a combination of workshops and follow-on activities. Virtual professional development opportunities will serve as a mechanism for increasing the reach of the project and on-line resources will provide persistent resources for the full geoscience and broader STEM communities. The project team anticipates that six-hundred (600) full-time and adjunct 2YC faculty and fifty (50) four-year college and university faculty will be engaged in professional development activities over the course of the project and that the project will impact an estimated 250,000 2YC students enrolled in geoscience courses."

Included in this project are: (1) two topical workshops, one on effective strategies for teaching all students and the other on workforce development through geoscience education at 2YCs; (2) an associated website of 2YC geoscience resources; (3) four types of dissemination workshops (national, regional, local, and virtual); and (4) a leadership development program for 2YC geoscience faculty members. The project develops effective models of professional development for full-time and adjunct 2YC geoscience faculty members, establishes networks of 2YC and 4YC faculty members and administrators focused on 2YC education, and builds leadership within the 2YC geoscience community. Furthermore, the project synthesizes resources to address challenges in 2YC geoscience education. The topical and dissemination workshops enable 2YC faculty members to discuss issues, challenges, and opportunities, to share effective strategies and examples, to meet new colleagues, to prepare action plans to improve curriculum and instruction, and to develop sustainable professional communities. <br/><br/>Strong undergraduate geoscience education is dependent on effective programs at 2YCs. 2YCs play an increasingly important role in producing earth-science literate citizens, developing a competent and creative geoscience workforce, teaching science to pre-service K-12 teachers, and providing a foundation for broadening participation in the geosciences. 2YC faculty members face substantial challenges - limited resources for travel, isolation, and few opportunities for geoscience professional development specific for their setting. By engaging 2YC geoscience faculty members in professional development, this project disseminates advances in STEM education to improve teaching, supports students in geoscience technical training, and helps prepare geoscience majors and pre-service teachers for college transfer. Online resources enable dissemination beyond workshop participants and are an important resource for both 2YC faculties and the broader geoscience community. Within the great diversity of the 2YC students, this project helps broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities in the geosciences by increasing their involvement in 2YC programs and by preparing them for enrollment in four-year institutions or for the geo-technical workforce."

Business, industry, and government need a well-prepared workforce that can prevent, detect, and investigate cybersecurity breaches, and the growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have appropriate, specific knowledge and skills. The cybersecurity challenge does not respect national boundaries. The Internet has global reach, and many companies do business and employ technical workers around the world. To address cybersecurity concerns in the United States well, educators and employers need to build cooperation and understanding with their international counterparts. In this project, Highline College, in collaboration with CyberWatch West, will organize and host the first International Collegiate Cyber Defense Invitational (ICCDI) competition during the summer of 2017. This event, which will be modeled after the U.S. Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC), will bring together approximately ten student teams and their coaches from nations around the world to tackle real-world cybersecurity challenges in the context of a simulated corporate network. This hands-on experience and competitive practice cannot be replicated in a typical classroom, and it will provide students with better training and preparation for the workforce. The interaction of students and faculty who have different educational backgrounds, as well as experiences with different technologies, will prepare the students for the global cybersecurity environment in which they will work. During the competition, conference sessions will also be held to allow representatives from companies, governments, and educational institutions to share knowledge about cybersecurity challenges and solutions.<br/><br/>The ICCDI planning committee will build into the competition's structure opportunities for the students to broaden their knowledge of cybersecurity as it is taught and practiced around the world. These technical features of the competition environment will be supplemented by the opportunity to meet cyber-defenders from other countries face-to-face to discuss both unique and common challenges and to establish new lines of communication. Colleges and universities that have participated in the U.S. Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition have discovered weaknesses in their current curricula and have designed changes to address them. By following a similar approach, the ICCDI will enable participating colleges and universities to adjust their curricula to meet cybersecurity demands in their region and in the international arena. Each team will receive a detailed report about how it performed in the competition, along with a debriefing from the judges and the cybersecurity experts on the Red (penetration testing) Team. The project evaluator will use aggregated data on the performance of the teams and surveys of participants to answer such questions as: How did the students and faculty benefit from the exposure to participants from other countries? What particular nomenclature and skills did participants learn in the international context? What cross-cultural issues emerged as significant during the competition? How will faculty and students use the knowledge and skills that they gained? What curricular changes will be implemented?"

This project reduces the significant challenges faced by faculty due to students' varied mathematical preparation and attitudes towards mathematics. It builds upon a CCLI Phase 1 project, ""The Math You Need, When You Need It.""<br/>Intellectual Merit: TMYN are self-paced, web-based student modules that support teaching and learning of quantitative topics in introductory geoscience courses. Pilot projects at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh (UWO) and Highline Community College (HCC) combined several proven pedagogies: student centered instruction, online modular resources and Just-in-Time Teaching. TMYN is being expanded: 1) to develop a variety of implementation models; and 2) to further facilitate the teaching and learning of quantitative skills in the geosciences. The effectiveness of the TMYN modules is being explored by training faculty in their versatility and working with interested faculty to design effective and innovative implementation models. Ten additional modules are being developed to bring the collection of TMYN collection to 16 quantitative concepts. A large dataset and web-based resources, including a tutorial in the use and implementation of TMYN, are being produced.  The expanded TMYN program is building resources related to teaching that could make this project self-sustaining.<br/>Broader impacts: This project contributes to increasing QL for undergraduates. Increasingly, colleges and universities are recognizing QL as an important outcome for their graduates. The modular design of TMYN allows for tailoring to individual courses and can support increased QL for the more than 350,000 students that take introductory geoscience every year. The project is designed to support geoscience faculty that want to integrate quantitative aspects of geoscience in their courses with little additional effort and minimal alienation from under-prepared students. Geoscience faculty with experience and leadership in the use of QL in the classroom are participating in workshops and using web pages that detail the results of the use of TMYN modules at many different institutions. The use of the SERC web server ensures widespread dissemination."

This unique program includes: 1) pre-assessment of students' quantitative skills, 2) modular, self-paced, student-centered instruction for under-prepared students and 3) post-assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of the program.  We are utilizing innovative instructional techniques based in best practices in mathematical education and thereby creating these modules so that they advance students' knowledge and understanding of mathematics across the geology curriculum.  Combined with classroom examples of quantitative concepts in a geoscience context, this project is addressing many concerns about the nation's STEM education, including difficulties with teaching large numbers of students from diverse backgrounds, course adaptation to students' preexisting knowledge, and student self-assessment and monitoring.<br/><br/>Broader impacts:  The higher education community recognizes quantitative literacy as an important goal for its graduates as they are integrated into our increasingly number-oriented society. This project is working toward that goal by increasing the quantitative literacy of American undergraduates and, as a result, the greater US population.  The modular nature and capability of tailoring instruction to meet individual student needs is supporting increased quantitative literacy in students with diverse backgrounds and mathematical abilities.  The project is impacting geoscience faculty who wish to embrace inclusion of quantitative aspects of geoscience in their courses with little extra effort and minimal alienation of under-prepared students.  In addition, the proposed project has the potential to be replicated across other academic disciplines and institutions wherever the application of quantitative skills is a barrier to student success. <br/>"
