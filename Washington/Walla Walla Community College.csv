Because graduates from these four programs are in high demand by employers, this project is designed to impact degree completion, advanced education and job placement for students. Due to the demographics of the institution and the targeted recruitment of dual enrollment high school students and adult basic education/career change seeking students, the project will help to diversify the workforce. The project will generate knowledge on the efficacy of courses that use the Integrated Basic Education and Skills Training (I-BEST) model to facilitate degree completion at a rapid pace with good student performance by providing contextualized instruction combined with supplemental support in the classroom. Research will assess the effectiveness of recruitment strategies for dual enrollment students and adult basic education/career change seeking students. Research will also evaluate to what extent the implemented retention strategies result in STEM degree completion and placement in relevant STEM jobs and/or advanced STEM education. The project will have a broad impact by (1) studying, developing, and implementing effective strategies to recruit and enroll women, students of Latina/o origin, and other traditionally underserved populations into STEM workforce programs; (2) developing and evaluating the implementation of coordinated, evidence-based practices that facilitate retention and completion in STEM workforce education degree programs; and (3) disseminating the lessons learned from the recruitment, retention, and realization strategies and practices with the highest beneficial impacts to internal and external audiences.<br/><br/>To increase the number of academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who are retained in and complete a program in engineering, agriculture, energy, or water, the project will focus on combining financial support through scholarships with strategies that center on (a) developing learning communities through two required courses on learning strategies/human relations and job seeking skills, (b) regular advising by Navigators who are experts in available support services, (c) mentoring by faculty instructors, and (d) frequent opportunities for mentoring by and interactions with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) industry professionals. Targeted recruitment activities that will be implemented include outreach to working farming families, outreach materials in Spanish and/or that feature women in STEM trades and professions, and quarterly open houses where STEM program demonstrations are promoted through community partners."

The department is the only two-year program in the six-state northwest region to have received TAC/ABET accreditation.  Coupled with a renewed recruitment effort, the scholarships are raising the number of students majoring in civil engineering technology from 25 to 45.  This is bringing the number of enrolled students to that experienced a decade ago.  The civil engineering program has a history of a high job placement rate. The number of scholarships being awarded for years one through four is 12, 18, 22, and 29 respectively.  This number of scholarships is in accord with the institutional need of financial aid for 60% of its students. The institution is putting into place a sustainable scholarship fund with donations received from industry partners during the project period.  <br/>The institution's 10,000 square mile service area has a multicultural population including a growing number of Hispanics who currently account for over 23% of the population.   The project is increasing the proportion of students of Hispanic descent in civil engineering technology to reflect that of the general population.<br/>"
