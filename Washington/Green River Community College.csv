The current project assesses the effectiveness of that course, as well as the community college experience, in influencing teachers' beliefs about the nature of science and their use of inquiry-based pedagogies in their own K-8 classrooms.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is its unique focus on community college students.  This student population represents approximately half of future teachers, but is under-represented in research on teacher training and practice.  Subjects include students who begin their education at a community college and complete a teaching certificate through several pathways.  These students are being followed throughout four years of preparation and into the K-8 classroom.  One group of subjects comprises Green River students enrolled in a pre-teacher preparation program who take the inquiry-based interdisciplinary science series.  A second group (control group) comprises students whose preparation has been more traditional.  Both groups then merge into year three of a four-year program housed at Central Washington University, where they take science methods courses.  These groups of students are being followed from the first year of college to the K-8 classroom to assess how their beliefs about the nature of science evolve.  In addition, the classroom practice and use of instructional materials of teachers who belong to both the experimental and control groups is being assessed.  The use of a cross-sectional design allows subjects to be assessed at various points along this teacher preparation continuum.<br/><br/>Findings on the influence of interdisciplinary, inquiry-based science courses on teacher beliefs and practices will be broadly applicable to community colleges and four-year institutions.  The outcomes advance our understanding of how best to prepare SMT teachers.  In addition, the role of community colleges in SMT teacher preparation is being addressed, with the potential of expanding the model of interdisciplinary science courses to other community colleges nation-wide.<br/>"

Almost half of all college students in Washington State attend community or technical colleges. While more students each year transfer from community colleges to four-year university STEM programs, most community colleges are unable to give students a ""hands-on"" undergraduate research experience. This puts students at a disadvantage when they transfer to universities.<br/><br/>Green River Community College (GRCC) and the University of Washington (UW) have responded by integrating ""Inquiry Lab Modules"" (ILMs) into upper-level community college science courses. ILMs focus on cutting-edge interdisciplinary fields such as organic photovoltaics and organic electronics. Students work in research teams to propose research questions, conduct experiments, analyze their results, and share their findings with peers. GRCC faculty members are implementing two ILMs in physics and plan to subsequently develop others in fields such as chemistry.<br/><br/>GRCC faculty members work with UW faculty and graduate students to ensure that ILMs provide authentic, transferable experiences that increase student retention in STEM fields - especially within underrepresented groups. Through visits to advanced research labs at the UW, students can build on research experiences that began in ILMs at GRCC. This will improve their success in transferring to STEM programs at UW or other universities. Students also acquire vital knowledge and skills for future STEM careers.<br/><br/>ILMs are relatively low-cost and are designed for easy adaptation to a variety of scientific fields. The Washington State Center of Excellence for Careers in Education is facilitating a dissemination workshop for non-GRCC community college faculty members to implement ILMs on their own campuses. ILM documentation is being made freely available on professional websites frequented by two-year college physics faculty and is being presented at national meetings of the American Association of Physics Teachers."

The confinement of data analysis and computation to lab period will be eliminated, making entire courses into active science courses.      Most science students develop problem solving skills for a limited range of problems modeled by homework assignments from traditional texts, but when presented with problems in real data analysis even talented students are often at a loss. Vocational students and non-science majors are even less likely to gain exposure to the real world of scientific data or to use a computer as anything other than a word processor. Businesses have identified the need for computer skills as one of the greatest problems in the workplace and education research has identified a need for direct exposure to investigative science with real data and applications. A coordinated program of computerized data analysis meets both needs.      This project involves all physical science students in the daily analysis of scientific data. Computers are used as natural components of scientific exploration. Less able students utilize peer tutors to boost their computer skills. All students collect data from experiments or industrial collaborators and analyze data cooperatively in the central computer laboratory. Interdisciplinary courses blend computers, physics, and chemistry, geology and the environment, and other sciences with subjects outside of the sciences as well.      Students in this program can strengthen their computer skills, their scientific literacy, their cooperative study skills, and their appreciation for the relevance and interconnectedness of science.
