Robust degree programs aimed at producing well-prepared teachers in STEM fields are a national priority that underpin progress in science, the advancement of national health initiatives, and overall national prosperity in an increasingly technical economy. Furthermore, recruiting and preparing a diverse workforce of K-12 teachers to teach science and math to an increasingly diverse group of students is crucial to improving STEM education while encouraging and supporting more women and students from underrepresented minority groups (URM) to pursue majors and careers in the sciences. As has been observed nationally, community colleges provide an increasingly important entry point to STEM careers.  Developing a STEM teacher recruitment, preparation, and induction model with collaboration between an undergraduate liberal arts college, a graduate school of education, a local community college, and a large urban school district is an important step in addressing the national shortage of well-prepared STEM teachers, particularly those that come from groups currently underrepresented in STEM fields. The model ensures that future STEM teachers have the content knowledge and pedagogical skills needed to succeed in today's diverse classrooms using a combination of scholarship support, rigorous academic courses and lab-based STEM research opportunities, meaningful and supported early classroom experiences, and mentoring at all points of their preparation and early careers as teachers. <br/><br/>The project is a partnership between Lewis & Clark College's College of Arts and Sciences (LC CAS), and Graduate School of Education and Counseling (LC GSEC), Portland Community College (PCC), and Portland Public Schools (PPS) and aims to build the framework for a STEM Teacher Pathways Program and design a scholarship model that will eventually engage four to five additional STEM preservice teachers per year in the LC GSEC Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program. At the conclusion of this Capacity Building project, a plan will have been developed for the recruitment, preparation, and induction of a more diverse cohort of STEM teachers. Key features of the plan include: an articulation agreement that allows for the seamless transfer of credits from PCC to LC CAS; the availability of scholarships for PCC transfer students as well as other STEM teacher candidates; opportunities for LC CAS undergraduate students to conduct research with STEM faculty, and to be mentored by LC GSEC STEM teacher candidates; and an induction and mentoring plan designed to support new STEM teachers once they begin teaching. These features create a pathway that will increase the number and diversity of candidates who complete an MAT in STEM Teacher Education and are hired and retained as teachers in local and other schools.  This program will draw from students majoring in Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Mathematics, and Physics.  Ultimately, this program should lead to increased recruitment and retention of STEM teachers from diverse backgrounds, increased success for their students, and, ideally, a society of scientific literacy for all."

Confocal microscopy is an advanced fluorescence imaging technique that has a number of advantages over traditional fluorescence microscopy and is a particularly powerful tool for live imaging experiments. The enabled projects focus on live imaging, both in whole organisms (zebrafish, nematode, yeast) and in cultured neurons (mouse). Some of these include: 1) a powerful multicolor approach (Brainbow) to test how newborn cells in the immature brain transform into organized neuronal circuits; 2) fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to study interactions among ribosomal components in yeast; 3) photoconvertible proteins to study the regulated release of factors in hippocampal neurons during neuronal activity; and 4) in vivo imaging techniques in living zebrafish to study the behavior of proteins that underlie Parkinson's Disease in humans. The principal investigators have externally funded, active research programs that engage undergraduate students as partners in data generation and publications in peer-reviewed journals. Acquisition of a confocal microscope will help these laboratories to generate high-quality publications in areas that utilize and develop cutting-edge live imaging approaches. <br/><br/>The confocal acquisition will also have a number of important broader impacts. First, future generations of scientists will have the opportunity to master modern imaging approaches during their undergraduate training. Many L&C students go on to Ph.D. programs and careers in science after winning competitive research fellowships. In part this can be attributed to L&C's strong focus on involving undergraduates in meaningful research; in the past five years, more than 90 undergraduate students have contributed as co-authors on publications. These dedicated and capable students will become trained in advanced microscopy by using the confocal system in their coursework and/or research laboratory. Second, L&C is a leader in the training of groups that are traditionally underrepresented in science. The natural sciences at L&C boast large numbers of women majors. In addition, L&C runs a successful, HHMI-funded summer research program that brings high school students from under-represented groups to campus for an intensive, 8-week laboratory experience. The confocal microscope will thus impact large numbers of young women who have chosen to pursue a career in science, as well as high school students who are just beginning to consider the direction of their future training. The opportunity to conduct live imaging experiments is often inspiring for students at this critical stage in their career path. Finally, the L&C Watzek Library Digital Initiatives staff will help design and construct an online public gallery that will showcase selected images and videos captured using the confocal microscope. The funded equipment thus has the potential to impact the broader community and to increase scientific literary among the public"

Molybdocene dichloride (Cp2MoCl2) is the only known organometallic system that carries out the hydrolysis of organophosphates in aqueous solution. The PI has demonstrated that this process involves a Lewis Acid/Base interaction of the molybdenum complex with the phosphate center. Increasing the Lewis acidity of Mo(IV) should accelerate ester hydrolysis. Thus, in this project the Lewis acidity of Mo(IV) centers will be altered by attaching small electron withdrawing/donating groups to the cyclopentadienyl ligand. A variety of these will be investigated in order to develop relationships which relate the structures of the complexes with their ability to hydrolyze phosphate esters. Using these relationships, new transition metal-based materials will be designed for the degradation of organophosphate neurotoxins. The second part of the project will investigate the ability of the molybdocene derivatives to hydrolyze the P-S bond in phosphinothioates. Throughout the project, mechanistic investigations will be undertaken.<br/><br/>Many chemical warfare agents and pesticides are phosphate esters or resemble phosphinothioates. The main detoxification strategies for these species are hydrolysis and incineration. This project seeks to develop new agents that can accelerate the hydrolysis of phosphates and phosphinothioates. There is current importance to developing better reagents that hydrolyze phosphate esters because substantial stockpiles of chemical warfare agents must be destroyed over the next few years. Educationally, this project will have a major impact on undergraduate research at Lewis and Clark College and the environmental implications of the project will impact the college's burgeoning Environmental Studies program as well as its chemistry and biochemistry programs.<br/><br/><br/>"

Constructed in 1946, BoDine Hall is home to the Department of Biology.  The current configuration of the aging facility does not readily support research programs in molecular biology, cell biology, population biology and botany.  Funds will be used to consolidate a group of laboratories into modern functional lab suites, creating two large laboratories that will serve three faculty members and their undergraduate research students.  Existing walls that separate spaces into smaller compartments will be removed to create open labs with common spaces and facilities.  A small tissue culture facility will be established, and an underused dark room will be remodeled to serve a shared equipment room.  In conjunction to the renovation effort, funds will be used to replace the Department's dilapidated greenhouse. By increasing opportunities for interaction among students and faculty, the renovated labs will foster an active and collegial research environment.  With the duplication of space and facilities being reduced, available research space will be efficiently utilized.  It is anticipated that a revitalized research environment will appeal to and entice more students to become active researchers, thus promoting the College's mission in science by ensuring that graduates are knowledgeable concerning the methods and ideas of modern science."

HVCs are by definition peculiar; they are the material with velocities not explainable by the differential rotation of the galaxy.  Despite over thirty-five years of study, their origin and nature remain a mystery. <br/> <br/>Proposed explanations of HVCs span a broad range.  One picture envisions a galactic fountain. In this model, powerful supernova explosions in the disk of the galaxy vent hot material into regions high above the plane. The gas then cools, condenses into clouds, and then rains back down upon the disk.  Another prominent model purports that the HVCs are dispersed throughout the Local Group of galaxies, the remnants of its creation.  It appears that some of the high-velocity material was tidally torn from the Magallenic clouds, and now streams behind them in their orbit around our galaxy.  Recent evidence suggests that one major complex of high-velocity material has low metallicity and is accreting onto the disk from high in the halo.  This is especially interesting because such fresh fuel for star formation has long been required by models of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy.  Current observational efforts to distinguish between these models will enhance present understandings of the formation of the Milky Way galaxy and its subsequent chemical evolution, as well as illuminate long debated issues concerning the connection of processes in the disk of our Galaxy to the halo. <br/> <br/>The vast majority of previous investigations of HVCs have used radio telescopes to study the 21- cm line, and thus only probe the neutral hydrogen present in the clouds.  Dr. Stephen Tufte, at Lewis and Clark College, will investigate ionized material associated with HVCs by making measurements of optical emission lines using the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM) Observatory.  WHAM is a Fabry-Perot based spectroscopic instrument that sits atop Kitt Peak in Arizona and is completely remote-operable.  The observations will take place from the principal investigator's laboratory on the campus of Lewis & Clark College, by way of the Internet.   <br/> <br/>This project will measure the intensities of emission lines of hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen from various HVCs.  The observations will provide information on the locations and metal abundances of HVCs, will yield new insights into the nature of compact HVCs, and will reveal the physical conditions present in the clouds such as their temperature and ionization state. The principal investigator has already proven WHAM to be a uniquely powerful instrument for these studies.  The new measurements have the ability to distinguish between the vastly different models that have been proposed to explain HVCs, and therefore significantly advance our understanding of their origin and nature.

One such motor protein, dynein, is important for moving cargo from the periphery of cells toward the center. In human cells, dynein needs to partner with another protein (dynactin) in order to move cargo across long distances, such as along nerve cells. The control or regulation of how these two proteins interact determines what, when, and where cargo are transported in a cell. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Nikolaus Loening from Lewis & Clark College to determine how the interactions between these two proteins are regulated by changes in the structure of dynein. Dr. Loening focuses on dynein intermediate chain, a part of the motor protein that initiates binding with dynactin, and studies how variations in its sequence and the addition of phosphate chemical groups change its binding behavior. The intermediate chain is difficult to study because it does not normally adopt a fixed and rigid shape; it is intrinsically disordered. Consequently, a variety of biophysical techniques are used to study the effects of these structural variations on the intermediate chain?s shape and its interactions with dynactin. This project provides undergraduate and high school students with opportunities to participate directly in this research. In addition, some parts of this research are incorporated into laboratory and special topics classes at Lewis & Clark College, thereby broadening participation in this project to include a larger number of undergraduate students. <br/><br/>This research project characterizes the structural properties of a little-studied isoform of the dynein intermediate chain (IC) to better localize the interaction between IC and its binding partners. The objective of this project is to develop a structural model for how an intrinsically disordered region of IC binds with the p150Glued subunit of dynactin. Results from these studies lead to insights into how this interaction is regulated by the isoform type or phosphorylation state of dynein. The dynamic nature of this system makes it difficult to study by cryo-electron microscopy or X-ray crystallography. In addition, the complex has characteristics that make it unfavorable for study by conventional NMR methods. This project uses a combination of mutagenesis to stabilize p150Glued combined with better localization of the binding site to allow the development of smaller, more tractable constructs that are providing high-resolution structural information. This work helps to develop an understanding for how this system is regulated, which further complements studies on the less dynamic regions of the dynein complex. In the course of this research, new methods for protein NMR spectroscopy are developed to benefit not only researchers studying dynein and intrinsically disordered proteins, but the protein NMR community at large.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project entitled Rural Access Mechatronics Program (RAMP) at Clark College in rural southwest Washington state is designed to increase the quantity and quality of mechatronics technicians  by developing a hybrid/online Certificate of Completion in Mechatronics Fundamentals. This will provide rural students, under-and unemployed workers, and incumbent workers a new option for an educational pathway from a certificate in mechatronics to an Associate in Applied Technology (AAT) degree with anytime anywhere courses resulting from the hybrid format. Upon successful completion, students will be prepared for either technician positions or be ready to progress on the educational pathway to a baccalaureate degree. The objectives of the project are to institutionalize hybrid learning options through faculty professional development and increase the number of quality mechatronics technicians. The curriculum will be validated by multiple advanced manufacturing employers in the region who are concerned by the rapidly growing need for more skilled mechatronics technicians in the Washington Oregon border area. Through the RAMP pilot, Clark will make significant contributions to the larger technological education community as the RAMP model will be replicable in other rural communities where access to education is an issue.<br/> <br/>The hybrid modality of the certificate opens up access to stackable certificates and an AAT degree for more rural students.

Faculty members are being prepared with the skills needed to deliver hybrid curricula, designed specifically to meet the needs of a rural population, thereby expanding hybrid learning options throughout the educational pathway. RAMP builds upon and expands the work of other ATE centers and projects including 1) applying best practices gleaned from iMEC (1304835) to guide the transition of curricula into a hybrid format; 2) partnering with CA2VES (1501695) to leverage their knowledge in hybrid/online delivery; utilize their modules/virtual labs; and investigate their video library for use in RAMP professional development efforts; and 3) utilizing the best practices of CARCAM (1304036) for recruitment and retention of rural and first-generation students. Employers are being engaged in the curriculum development process to assure that mechatronics technicians have the skills and knowledge to be well prepared to work in industry. A comprehensive evaluation is being developed to continuously enhance the project activities and provide opportunities for researching and evaluating the success of the project and its deliverables, as well as the sharing of best practices."

These events are termed ""extrafluvial"" because they are initiated outside of the river channel itself, but alter the river by changing the channel slope and width; burying the valley bottom; or creating temporary dams that can generate cataclysmic floods upon failure. We hypothesize that these periodic channel-encroaching events are a dominant force in creating and maintaining the geomorphic features of many river canyons. The Owyhee River in southeastern Oregon is the principal field site in which the individual and combined impacts of these catastrophic events will be explored. Geospatial analyses will be used to map and understand the distribution of these processes on other rivers in the region. From these results, reach-scale calculations of incision potential will be made to address quantitatively the relations between landslide/lava invasions and river channel evolution. The results will contribute to the rapidly expanding field of landscape modeling by improving representations of the processes by which rivers carve their valleys. <br/> <br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Central Washington University (CWU) and Lewis and Clark College (LCC) are primarily undergraduate institutions; students will conduct the geospatial analysis in an undergraduate course, participate in field trips through the College Outdoors Program, and work directly with investigators.

Close collaborations with scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey and U.S Forest Service will help disseminate results to stakeholders. The project will contribute to an understanding of geologic hazards posed by large landslide dams and has implications for assessing river-channel impacts of removing human-constructed dams. <br/>"

This is currently a challenge because such tasks are often open-ended and exploratory in nature. Because they can be completed in many ways, student learning in cybersecurity may not always be recognized by the instructor. This makes it hard to assess the sophistication of a student's path to success. Similarly, it may also be a challenge to identify the reasons why students experience failure, and to provide useful and timely feedback to students and instructors. The proposed project work will uncover reasons behind student underperformance in practical cybersecurity exercises, and will help identify effective interventions. The proposed research may also help network test beds retain and better serve their users. The impact of these activities will be three-fold. First, the developed tools will be integrated with two previously developed platforms for cybersecurity exercises: DeterLab and EDURange. This will directly impact approximately 2,000 students annually. Second, the tools will be highly portable to other platforms that use Linux in practical cybersecurity exercises, and can reach a wider audience. Third, the tools will help retain talent from disadvantaged and minority populations, as it will allow for earlier intervention and feedback to complete challenging, practical tasks. <br/><br/>This project will develop ACSLE, a framework for automated assessment of student learning in practical cybersecurity exercises. ACSLE will engage in constant and extensive monitoring of student interaction with the computer, and will allow for the correlation with desired learning outcomes. ACSLE starts with the development of tools that monitor low-level student activities, such as commands typed, traffic generated and files and processes created. These low-level records are then synthesized into high-level indicators of student progress on a given cybersecurity task. The outcomes will allow for: (1) classification of students into several learning styles based on proficiency with a task and level of foundational skill; (2) clustering of solutions to specific learning challenges identified in student groups that have similar learning styles; (3) collection of successful learning paths developed over time and  methods for identifying struggling students; (4) identification of causes of failure and delivery of appropriate learning interventions; and (5) aggregation of performance data for a class as well as identification of tasks that are difficult for many students. ACSLE will thus provide useful information for students and teachers, and improve overall learning in practical cybersecurity exercises."

These compartments carry out essential cell activities and are broadly conserved within and between species.  Lysosomes, one type of organelle found within nearly all plant and animal cells, function as major sites of degradation.  Interestingly, in many cell types, lysosome-related organelles (LROs) co-exist with conventional degradative lysosomes due to the activity of specific pathways mediating the formation of LROs.  However, most of the known factors that mediate LRO formation also function in the construction of lysosomes, raising the question of what controls the specific formation of LROs.  A family of homologous Rab proteins, which generally act as switches to regulate the processes involved in moving material between organelles, have been identified that function in the formation of LROs but not conventional lysosomes.  This project explores the hypothesis that these Rabs control LRO-specific formation processes by investigating the activity of the GLO-1 Rab protein that functions in the construction of an LRO called the gut granule.  Gut granules are found within the intestinal cells of the model genetic organism C. elegans and are analogous to organelles in mammals that function in the synthesis/storage of substances mediating pigmentation and blood clotting.  Briefly, the research will identify the cellular site of GLO-1 function, the regulators of GLO-1 activity, and the processes controlled by GLO-1.  As GLO-1 is highly conserved, this research will provide important insights into the mechanisms mediating the formation of LROs in a diverse array of cells and organisms. <br/><br/>Broader impacts:  The research will involve 30 undergraduates a year in collaborative, investigative, and original research.  Undergraduate students working in the PI's research laboratory and upper division Cell Biology course (enrollment 24) will design, implement, interpret, and present the results of their experiments investigating the function of GLO-1 in LRO formation.  The PI will participate in HHMI and Miller Foundation supported initiatives at Lewis & Clark College to increase the representation of underrepresented groups in science by mentoring the studies of LRO formation by local high school and community college students in the research lab.  Ultimately, this work will provide hands on scientific training for a large and diverse array of students, many of whom will progress on to careers in research and education"

Professor Nikolaus Loening from Lewis and Clark College and colleagues Louis Kuo and Casey Jones are acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The NMR studies improve understanding of synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students during the summer research period, in independent study projects during the academic year and as part of final-year undergraduate thesis projects. Collaborations with researchers at Linfield College, Pacific University and high schools are in place. <br/><br/>The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It is especially helpful in studies of how organometallic complexes are used to degrade pesticides and to desulfurize fossil fuels to make them more environmentally friendly as well as for developing and characterizing how compounds such as resveratrol are released from metals which may be relevant for stent design. The spectrometer is also useful for developing surface-supported catalysts for organic synthesis, and for characterizing the structures of venom peptides.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Protons and neutrons, in turn, are made of quarks, which are held together by what is known as the strong nuclear force. However, how the strong force holds the quarks together is still one of the most puzzling questions in physics. It is in our national interest to answer this question as it will advance our knowledge about one of the fundamental aspects of nature, namely the origin and structure of matter. This project will develop new techniques that will shed light on the nature of the strong nuclear force.  In general, this force is poorly understood primarily because the theory that explains it, namely quantum chromodynamics (QCD), has a complex mathematical structure.  Professor Anber seeks to modify QCD by adding new deformations that will make it possible to study the strong force by analytical means.  This research project will also have significant broader impacts on undergraduate students and the broader community. Professor Anber will recruit highly motivated students to collaborate with him, making special efforts to reach out to women and underrepresented minorities. Professor Anber will also design two courses on field theory and computational physics, and several meaningful examples from his research will be brought to the classroom. In addition, he will present the results of his research in workshops and conferences and will give talks at other universities and liberal-arts colleges. The undergraduate students who will participate in the proposed research will disseminate their contributions through talks and posters in conferences. <br/><br/>More technically, Professor Anber proposes to deform QCD by compactifying QCD on a circle and/or adding matter in various representations, which introduces an infrared cutoff that brings the theory into a weakly coupled regime and makes it amenable to semi-classical treatment. The deformed theory is not the real world. It is hoped, however, that by studying this class of models, one will gain new insights into real-world QCD. Surprisingly enough, studies of this class of theories have shown that various physical observables have the same qualitative behavior both in the strongly- and weakly-coupled regimes, suggesting continuity between weakly- and strongly-coupled theories. This conjectured continuity is tantalizing. However, we are still far from a complete understanding of this continuity, and ample evidence in support of or even against it has to be collected before such an understanding can be reached. The proposed research program will enhance our understanding of the structure of compactified gauge theories and inform us about the limitations of and/or reasons behind the conjectured continuity. The proposed study aims to (1) classify all confining gauge theories on a circle and understand the structure of the molecular instantons that form in the vacuum of this class of theories, (2) study the phase diagram of thermal gauge theories on a circle, (3) track the behavior of physical observables as we decompactify the circle, and (4) compare and contrast the topological field theories that describe the extended objects (confining strings) in the weakly- and strongly-coupled regimes. Confronting the results of the proposed study with the available lattice data may yield a new perspective on the structure of confining gauge theories."

Pesticides and herbicides are used to kill weeds and insects, but these chemicals last a long time and can be found throughout the environment. These chemicals can be damaging to animals and humans, and have even been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Using basic chemistry techniques, this project from Professor Louis Kuo at Lewis and Clark College looks for ways to make these pesticides and herbicides safer.  A main ingredient in these chemicals is the element phosphorus. This project also investigates the use of non-toxic metals to collect, break down, safely recover, and transform the phosphate-based toxins for a new use.  Phosphorus is non-renewable and essential for life on earth, so recycling it is important for sustainability. This research lies at the interface of inorganic and organic chemistry, and uses a combination of experimental and computational techniques. Undergraduate researchers, high school students, and high school teachers participate in this project, while engaging in meaningful science within the context of safe environmental stewardship.<br/><br/>This research project addresses environmental toxin remediation and phosphorus recovery. Organophosphates (OP) are agricultural pesticides that are now ubiquitous in the environment. As such, there is a need for materials that degrade these OP pesticides in a practical fashion. This goal is more meaningful when the degraded OP pesticides are recovered as usable organophosphates since phosphorus is an essential but non-renewable resource.  This study focuses on using supported and solution=-phase molybdenum complexes that convert organophosphate toxins into commodity chemicals.  Specifically, the project examines how polystyrene-supported and picolinato (solution) complexes of molybdenum-peroxo compounds convert sulfur-containing organophosphate pesticides and the widely-used glyphosate herbicide (Roundup) into phosphate commodity chemicals. Several hypothetical routes involving reactive oxygen species are tested with spectroscopic studies on solution models and supported molybdenum-peroxo complexes.  In parallel with the experimental work there is a computational component using density functional theory that simulates the organophosphate reactions.  The goal is to predict and design better molybdenum complexes that accomplish the organophosphate degradation.  In this connection, the long term goal is to develop new supported and practical molybdenum-peroxo materials that degrade the organophosphate toxins into value-added materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Venoms of brown recluse spiders have toxins that cause the death of cells and tissue in mammals, but also help the spiders immobilize and/or digest insect prey.  The toxins that are known to affect mammals can damage cell surfaces by cutting a specific ""head group"", called choline, off of a molecule called a sphingolipid. Other recluse spider toxins can only cut off a different kind of head group, called ethanolamine, that mammals do not have in their sphingolipids, so these toxins may be less harmful to mammals. Many insects have both kinds of head group, so both types of toxin are probably important for predation, perhaps in different ways. Dr. Cordes, a structural biologist and biochemist, and Dr. Binford, a biologist and expert on venomous invertebrates, combine their expertise to determine how these toxins distinguish the different head groups, and what the biological consequences are for predators and their prey. The specific action of these toxins on different head groups could also make them useful in biotechnology for detecting or manipulating different kinds of cell surfaces.  The broader impacts of this project  involve outreach through mentorship of undergraduates doing integrative and collaborative research at two different institutions.  Spiders attract public interest and afford an opportunity to inform the public on scientific investigations on the subject. An innovative program known as ""SpiderFest"" is conduucted both at the laboratory and at a science expo in Portland. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to understand the causes and effects of substrate head group (ethanolamine vs. choline) preference in phospholipase D toxins from recluse spiders. The specific goals are to map interfacial binding sites in the toxins, elucidate amino-acid sequence determinants of substrate head group preference; characterize the evolution of substrate preference in the recluse spider toxin family; and correlate head group preference to biological effects of the toxins. Methods to be used include NMR, X-ray crystallography, computational structural biology, site-directed mutagenesis, phylogenetic reconstruction, enzymatic assays, and biological assays. Information from this study illuminates differential recognition, by proteins that act at membrane surfaces, of the two most common lipid head groups in nature, phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine. The project also sheds light on toxin recruitment and specialization in venoms and interesting aspects of arthropod biochemistry and neurobiology. These toxins could also be developed into valuable analytical tools to probe important differences in cell surface structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Large differences in venom composition among the few studied species make the rest of the 39,000 species exciting sources of discovery of novel chemistry. Moreover, this chemical diversity makes a great context for studying evolutionary mechanisms that create novel toxins and modify them over time. This CAREER grant will fund development of an undergraduate-centered research program focused on the evolutionary origin and diversification of a unique and medically important toxin in venoms of brown recluse spiders and their relatives (Sicariidae). This toxin, sphingomyelinase D (SMase D) causes dermonecrotic lesions after bites of these spiders. The evolution of SMase D is particularly interesting because this enzyme is unique to venoms of sicariid spiders and pathogenic bacteria that cause disease in farm animals. Recent evidence from the PI and collaborators indicates that the evolutionary history of this toxin includes lateral transfer between spiders and bacteria. Furthermore, this toxin is a member of a gene family in spiders that undergoes periodic homogenization among different members, and either gene duplication and loss, or turning on and off of genes, which has resulted in loss of SMase D activity in some species.<br/><br/>The specific research goals are to: (1) resolve relationships among worldwide representatives of species in this lineage and their close relatives using molecular phylogenetic analyses; (2) analyze the dynamics of origin and loss of venom-expressed SMase D using comparative enzyme assays and analyses of venom-expressed genes (cDNAs) from across the complete range of species with this toxin; (3) refine our understanding of the source of origin by probing for related genes in related groups of spiders. Understanding the mechanisms of origin and diversification of SMase D will serve as a case study of the molecular evolution of a unique toxin, and will provide information of medical relevance. Understanding the distribution and diversity of the SMase D molecule will inform us about the risks of bites from related species, and will aid in the development of treatments that are effective against bites of any member of this spider family. In so doing, it will promote awareness of the value of understanding basic systematics, organismal diversity, and evolution for the field of biological toxicology.<br/>Educational goals: This work will involve undergraduates in collaborative, interdisciplinary research that spans organisms and molecules. They will learn the value of approaching questions with an evolutionary (historical) perspective. In coursework, the PI will: (1) expand a phylogenetic biology course at Lewis & Clark College that includes bioinformatics, reconstruction of tree topologies and ancestral character states, and applications of these methods; (2) create a non-majors arachnology course that emphasizes the value of evolutionary approaches and integrated knowledge of organisms; (3) create a Web-based interactive diagnostic key for Loxosceles and Sicarius species diversity that is connected to the Tree of Life Web site.<br/>"

This project studies the timing and success of reproduction in tropical forest plants. Tropical species may use cues of seasonal shifts (for example, in rainfall or light availability) to time the start of reproduction, perhaps to ensure their seeds are dispersed during conditions that will be favorable for the growth and survival of young seedlings. Rainfall, light availability, temperature, and other environmental conditions influence each stage of reproduction- flowering, fruit maturation, seed dispersal, and seedling growth. Beneficial conditions for reproduction can vary within a year, due to seasonality, and among years, due to climate cycles like El Nino. This project focuses on long term data in order to capture periods when conditions are better or worse for various types of plants. The research takes place at multiple tropical forest study sites to separate the effects of local weather variability from large regional climate patterns. By measuring the cues tropical plants use to start reproduction and examining which environmental conditions affect seedling growth and survival, the long-term data from this project will strengthen our ability to predict the future of tropical forests and the benefits these forests confer to society. Training of multiple undergraduate students will occur at the sites, by each of the collaborating universities.<br/><br/>These long-term studies will enable tests of hypotheses concerning: (1) what are the environmental cues that induce flowering; (2) how is reproduction in tropical forests affected by disturbances such as wind storms, droughts, and by natural climate cycles such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, which vary at subdecadal to multidecadal time scales;  (3) how do species with different traits (e.g., small vs. large seeds, soft vs. dense wood) respond to environmental variation; and (4) how does episodic reproduction ramify through to the structure of adult populations. This research approach will effectively close the demographic gap between studies of early reproduction and the dynamics of sapling and adult tree populations. At each of the field sites, species-specific flower, fruit and seed rain is recorded multiple times each year using seed traps. Additionally, all woody seedlings are recorded in an annual census of hundreds of 1-m2 plots adjacent to seed traps, at each site. The trap and plot censuses take place within large mapped forest dynamics plots where all trees >1 cm in diameter are identified and regularly measured.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First, a small cluster of cells increases dramatically in number, then transforms into an exquisitely organized organ with a complicated pattern of connections.  Most of the time, this process results in brains that are perfectly normal, with the right number of nerve cells.  Surprisingly little is known, though, about how the growing brain decides how many cells to produce.   This research project will look at the control of cell number in the growing brains of transparent living zebrafish during the first few days of life.  The PI has developed techniques for watching clusters of dividing cells over time in special zebrafish embryos whose brain cells glow with unique combinations of colors (called ""Brainbow"").  This coloring allows new cells to be followed as they divide off from their mother cell.  So far it appears that families of cells (mother cell with her set of daughter cells) compete with other families to survive in the growing brain.  This type of competition has not been seen before in the brain, and may be responsible for controlling growth - not only in the brain, but in other organs as well.  The PI will test which genes are important for cell families to survive this competition.  The work will generate a number of new research tools that will be shared with the scientific community.  Undergraduate students will perform and analyze  the experiments themselves, providing rich opportunities for research training early in developing scientists' careers.  By also transforming the data they have personally collected into an interactive, educational website, students will learn various digital media approaches to making scientific material understandable to traditional and non-traditional audiences.  The colorful images produced by this research have great appeal to both scientists and non-scientists, making it easier for students to learn how to engage the public with their work.<br/>  <br/>To study dynamic cellular behavior in the living brain, the PI has developed an approach using in vivo time-lapse confocal imaging and multicolor fluorescent protein (Brainbow) expression in zebrafish.  Using this technique, the PI has shown that programmed cell death occurs non-randomly in the living brain, with specific neural progenitor cells and their neuronal progeny (entire clones) undergoing cell death in a coordinated manner, while neighboring clones appear normal. If whole clones of dividing cells are in fact competing with one another, increases or decreases in cellular fitness should influence a clone's competitive edge.  The planned research will use a mosaic approach to alter gene expression in individual cells, coupled with global Brainbow expression to simultaneously follow dynamics within multiple clones of dividing cells.  Cellular fitness will be targeted via both cell-intrinsic mechanisms (cell cycle, c-myc activity) and cell-extrinsic mechanisms (access to extracellular BMP signaling).  These experiments will test directly whether cellular fitness influences a clone?s ability to survive in the developing brain.  Overall this may support the hypothesis that competition among clones of dividing cells helps regulate neuronal production and growth in the developing nervous system."

This scientific research contribution thus supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare. In this case, the benefits will be insights to improve earthquake disaster preparedness, which will save lives, economic losses, and reduce panic, anger and confusion during a future event.<br/><br/> <br/>This project addresses key gaps in current understandings of how social cognitive perspectives apply to disaster preparedness. Specific research objectives are to: 1) characterize the effectiveness of interactive environments for promoting multiple solution pathways and problem-solving related to earthquake preparedness; 2) evaluate the relevance of different approaches to observational learning related to earthquake preparedness; 3) quantify the effects of cooperation on confidence in and inclination to take preparedness action; and 4) assess the effects of social processing through digital networks on behavior adoption inclination and critical awareness. These objectives will be accomplished through four experiments using interactive digital media, supported by focus groups that ensure salience of the media to target audiences and add depth to experimental result interpretation. Pathways linking experimental variables, possible mediating variables, and key dependent variables including self-efficacy, outcome expectations, intent to act, and preparedness action will be elucidated via structural equation modeling. Extending the study of social influences on preparedness behavior into the digital arena is an innovation that resonates with the media consumption habits of the target audience. While most applications of social cognitive theory to the disaster preparedness context are cross-sectional studies, use of interactive digital environments permits an experimental approach with which to test and extend current understandings.

A musical instrument can be thought of as a system of coupled oscillators. In the case of the mandolin, the strings are set into oscillation with a plectrum and contain energy in a harmonic series of frequencies. The bridge of the instrument is set into vibration by the strings and in turn conveys the energy to the front plate of the mandolin. The front plate radiates sound but also couples to the back plate through the ribs of the instrument; both surfaces set the air inside the body of the instrument into oscillation. The instrument is thus modeled as a collection of harmonic oscillators coupled to each other through the bridge, ribs, or by direct contact between plate and air. The PI is studying the coupling between two tuned strings, their coupled interaction with the bridge and soundboard, and the two-slope decay. He is measuring the input of mechanical impedance at the bridge and the structural modal shapes of the body and the coupling between the plates and the air cavity. The ultimate objective of the proposed work is to understand how the mechanical properties of the instrument and its construction determine the character of the musical chords and identify potential improvements in bridge design for the mandolin, and other string instruments. The theory of coupled oscillators and the phenomenon of resonance is a central and broadly applicable subject in dynamics. The mandolin provides a rich and fascinating experimental arena for the application of dynamics and one that is accessible to measurement with instrumentation available to undergraduate physics departments. This project will provide transformative experiences to undergraduate students by captivating their interest in hands-on research and then providing rigorous training in its methods. A significant outcome of this project is to invest in the next generation of our nation's STEM workforce.  The students will be exposed to a wide variety of experimental techniques and scientific instruments as well as advanced theoretical concepts, all broadly applicable throughout physics and engineering.  <br/><br/>In investigating the acoustics of the mandolin, the PI and his students will carry out a detailed study of the coupling of the doubled strings using high-speed video, and the musical implications of these interactions will be elucidated. These results will also shed light on other musical instruments with doubled strings, such as the lute, oud, and 12-string guitar.  Measurements of the sound spectrum and bridge impedance combine to characterize the transfer of mechanical energy from string motions through the bridge to the motions of the instrument body that ultimately produce sound. Experiments to understand in detail the connection between the mechanical properties of the bridge and the resulting sound spectrum aim to identify potential improvements in bridge design. Details of the resulting body motions, the modes of vibration, will be studied using holographic interferometry.  A study of the coupling of low-frequency plate modes of the mandolin?s front and back surfaces with the Helmholtz modes due to oscillations of air within the body will be compared to the classic studies of guitars."

The ability to understand and control these sensitive interactions is also the key to the creation of new atom-light based technologies.   Some atom-light interactions are sensitive to the surrounding magnetic field.  As an example, an atom is extremely selective about the precise colors of light it absorbs, but when it is placed in a magnetic field, the atom's color choices will shift depending on the strength of the field.  Such interactions can be used as the foundation of a device, called an ""atomic magnetometer,"" that can measure unknown magnetic fields.  This investigation studies interactions between laser light and a specially prepared gas of atoms that is sensitive to small variations in the surrounding magnetic field.   The special preparation uses two lasers and a controlled magnetic field to temporarily but dramatically change how laser light travels through a gas of atoms.  As a result, the laser light's brightness fluctuates, or flickers, in ways that are not yet fully understood.  These fluctuations not only carry information about the atoms, but they are also especially sensitive to magnetic field variations.  This research will further our scientific understanding of atom-light interactions, which is of broad interest for many technological applications.  Simultaneously, the research will produce new techniques for detecting small, unknown magnetic fields, like the magnetic fields emitted from the human heart.  The new detection methods will potentially impact a broad range of medical and scientific fields, and because they make use of low-cost and potentially portable laser systems, any resulting technological applications will be widely accessible and suitable for use outside of the laboratory environment. Undergraduate students will be involved at all stages of this research agenda, preparing them for careers in research science and other STEM-related fields.  <br/><br/>Light intensity fluctuations derived from atomic coherence can encode valuable information about coherence dynamics in an atomic vapor.  Furthermore, they provide a platform for a new class of compact and simple atomic magnetometers.  This research agenda uses low-cost, free-running diode lasers with inherent frequency noise that is converted into information-rich intensity noise near an atomic resonance.  The amplitude and phase of the intensity fluctuations are particularly sensitive to small magnetic field variations near an atomic coherence between Zeeman sublevels.  Hanle effect Electromagnetically Induced Transparency will be induced in rubidium vapor and used to prototype and optimize a novel magnetometry technique relying on coherence-derived light fluctuations.  The converted laser intensity noise will be studied using self-correlations and spectrum analysis.  The findings will deepen our understanding of the relationship between the light fluctuations and the underlying atomic coherence, as well as give us the tools to build a new atomic magnetometer. Moreover, the results will provide useful insight for mitigating noise from imperfect lasers."

It is believed that the growing tip of neurites secrete an enzyme that is a proteinase, to locally break down the ECM and allow the neurites to penetrate it.  This project utilizes novel fluorescent dyes and time-lapse microscopic imaging techniques to examine the localization of a particular metallo-proteinase, degradation of the matrix, and intracellular traffic carrying the proteins.  The project is designed to reveal for the first time the dynamics of molecules believed to be integral to mechanisms for neurite elongation.  Results will have an impact on developmental biology, cell biology and imaging technology, and the project provides a novel multidisciplinary experience involving undergraduates in exciting research over an unusual range of techniques from biochemistry to optics."

Specifically, experiments are planned for the Environmental Chemistry and Perspectives in Nutrition nonmajor courses; Equilibrium and Analysis and General Chemistry (Accelerated) Laboratory science major introductory courses; and the Inorganic/Physical Chemistry Lab, Instrumental Analysis, and student/faculty research projects in the upper-division courses.    It is important that both introductory and advanced students get first-hand experience with this instrument in order to understand the advantages and limitations of the atomic absorption method.

The research will result in methods which are general enough to apply across a wide range of particle sizes and materials, and which are relevant to diverse applications. In nature, the nanofibers in natural gecko adhere to surfaces, yet shed dirt particles. The research will first develop a model for particle capture and release in both natural and synthetic fiber arrays. Using the developed self-cleaning model, arrays of nanofibers will be created to control particle adhesion, transport, and removal. The research results will be compared on a wide range of particle sizes and materials using both the natural gecko and synthesized nanofibers to validate models. Deliverables include models of particle capture and release mechanisms, demonstration particle cleaning surfaces, documentation of research results, engineering student and post-doc education, and research experiences for undergraduates.<br/><br/>If successful, the results of this research will provide the understanding to create dry self-cleaning surfaces, and adhesives which work reusably in dirty environments. These dry self-cleaning surfaces could be used for applications such as coatings which keep surfaces clean without water, surfaces which shed bacteria to stay sterile, air cleaning systems, and dirt shedding apparel. Electrically controlled fibers will allow particles to be captured and released when desired. Results of this research will be disseminated to allow the creation of commercial devices in which surfaces can self-clean without water. The project will educate undergraduate and graduate students in both biomimetics and nanotechnology.

Lysosomes function in a diverse array of important cellular processes including the presentation of antigens to the immune system, the turnover of cell surface signaling molecules, tissue remodeling, and the destruction of pathogens.  While much is known regarding the cellular and biochemical function of lysosomes, the processes involved in lysosome assembly and maintenance in multicellular animals remain poorly understood.  To aid in the understanding of these processes, the Hermann lab has begun to identify genes necessary for the assembly/stability of lysosomes in the intestinal cells of the model multicellular organism, C. elegans.  One of the genes identified, glo-1, encodes a Rab GTPase that may regulate transport between cellular compartments.  This work aims to determine whether glo-1 functions in the assembly or the maintenance of lysosomes and if glo-1 prevents the inappropriate fusion of lysosomes with the cell membrane. To learn which step in lysosome assembly/stability requires GLO-1 protein function, this research will determine the sub-cellular localization of GLO-1.  Finally, this project will extend the pilot genetic screen that led to the identification of glo-1 to identify additional genes that are necessary for lysosome assembly/maintenance.  <br/>This research will identify and characterize the activity of genes that are likely to function in the assembly/maintenance of lysosomes in all multicellular animals.  Regulation of lysosome content effectively prevents the accumulation of dysfunctional proteins and organelles in cells.

Within these communities, green algae typically represent an important source of food, shelter, competition, and sediment.  Understanding the factors that govern the timing, intensity, and consequences of algal reproduction represents an important step towards elucidating the ecological role of green algae within tropical marine habitats. This study seeks to examine the environmental factors governing the onset and timing of sexual reproduction; the resulting success of gamete release; and the association between these variables and patterns of algal dispersal, recruitment, and, life?history.  Field studies will link the environment and algal ecology, particularly with regard to life history parameters and the expression of sexual reproduction.  Using permanent quadrants, the investigator will quantify patterns of algal growth, mortality, and reproduction (both sexual and asexual). Measures of the physical environment (currents, salinity, day length, temperature) and demography (age, size, density) will be correlated with the timing and intensity of reproductive events. Algal transplants will help identify causality among these variables. Zygote dispersal and development will be monitored during early life?history. In addition, the investigator will study fertilization as a function of gamete size and behavior (e.g. motility, phototaxis, etc.) by mixing of gametes, in vitro, at varied concentrations. Spatial and temporal patterns of gamete concentration will be quantified, in situ, as a function of adult dispersion, gamete production, gamete size, and the physical environment. These data will be compared with rates of gamete cloud dispersion by means of video/image analysis."

This is a novel study that will lead to a better understanding of how dynamic spatial patterns become disordered.  Experimentally, Taylor vortex flow (TVF), with both long single and multiple-waist hourglass geometries will be studied.  Previous experiments by the PIs demonstrate that TVF with a short single hourglass geometry exhibits spatially-localized, low-dimensional chaotic pattern dynamics consisting of persistent phase slips near the center of the vortex pattern.  Lengthening this system, or introducing multiple hourglass waists, is expected to generate more complex dynamics that are no longer spatially localized.  Numerically, a spatially-ramped reaction-diffusion model and models of diffusively coupled nonlinear oscillators will be explored.  The reaction-diffusion model is already known to exhibit localized chaos in a short system and STC in a long system, but the transition between these states has not been examined yet.  Building on their previous success controlling localized chaotic pattern dynamics, the PIs will attempt feedback control of STC in the experimental geometries, informed by the development of control algorithms for the numerical models.  The project will offer highly accessible opportunities for undergraduate students to learn about chaos, nonlinear dynamics, pattern formation, control theory, and fluid mechanics.<br/><br/>Non-technical Abstract<br/><br/>The objective of this project is a better understanding and characterization of how dynamic spatial patterns become disordered, and the development of minimal interventions sufficient to suppress this disorder.  Constantly changing but recognizable spatial patterns occur throughout natural and human-made systems-for example, patterns of cloud formation, of electrical conduction in mammalian hearts, and of light output from high-powered lasers.  Dynamic patterns often display what is referred to as ""spatiotemporal chaos"" (STC), a combined state of order and disorder in which the changes in the pattern are unpredictable over both time and space.  How patterns make a transition from localized chaos to STC as the size of a system is increased is not yet understood.  This project will investigate this transition in a rotating fluid system in which a pattern of vortices is created and in computer models that simulate analogous dynamic patterns.  The geometry of the fluid system is designed so that there are regions in which vortices are chaotically created and destroyed.  The PIs will also attempt to control STC (i.e. suppress the disorder) by creating a feedback loop that makes very small changes to the speed of rotation.  The ability to control STC has important technological and medical implications (e.g. control of erratic lasers, arrhythmic hearts, and mixing processes in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries).  The project will offer highly accessible opportunities for undergraduate students to learn about chaos, nonlinear dynamics, pattern formation, control theory, and fluid mechanics.<br/>"

The adhesive on gecko toes differs dramatically from that of conventional pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs), which are soft polymers that degrade, foul, self-adhere, and attach accidentally to inappropriate surfaces. In contrast, gecko toes bear angled arrays of branched, hair-like fibers (setae) formed from stiff, hydrophobic keratin that act as a bed of angled springs with an effective stiffness similar to that of PSAs. Setae are self-cleaning and maintain function for months during repeated use in dirty conditions. Adhesion in setae requires maintenance of a shear load directed toward the body of the gecko. Thus, gecko setae resist inappropriate bonding and are capable of easy and rapid attachment and detachment. Prior research is based predominately on data collected from a single species, the tokay gecko, on smooth surfaces at ambient relative humidity. Functionally, the diversity of setal designs in over 1000 species of gecko is not well understood. Also, theory and data conflict with regard to the effects of van der Waals forces and humidity on gecko adhesion. These are topics of central importance in understanding the mechanisms of gecko adhesion and in the design and application of gecko-like synthetic adhesives (GSAs). This project focuses on identifying general, testable principles underlying the novel attachment system that geckos use to climb. It will test the validity of four theoretical models of setal structure and function by measuring material properties and contact mechanics of a diverse sample of gecko setae, and by utilizing GSAs as physical models. The project will tease apart the effect of humidity and temperature on keratin mechanical properties from the effect of surface hydration by measuring changes in stiffness and frictional adhesion as a function of humidity, temperature, and substrate hydrophobicity. The research will advance understanding of the micromechanics of gecko setae under a range of biologically relevant environmental conditions, enabling transformative advances in adhesion technology and the physics of friction. Engineered adhesive nanostructures inspired by geckos may become the glue of the future and perhaps the screw of the future as well."

The cells of complex organisms contain compartments called organelles that endow cells with their specific functional properties.  While many organelles are common to all of the cells within an organism, some are only generated in a subset of cell types.  One of these, called a lysosome-related organelle (LRO), plays varied and important roles, however only certain animal cells generate them.  The research will investigate how this is achieved and identify factors that promote the formation of LROs.  Many undergraduates (25-55/year)will be mentored in collaborative, investigative, and original research as part of the project.  Many of these students will come from underrepresented groups in the sciences.  The work will provide hands on scientific training for a large and diverse group of students, most of who will progress on to careers in science and education.<br/><br/>In many cell types, lysosome-related organelles LROs co-exist with conventional lysosomes due to the activity of conserved LRO-specific trafficking pathways that divert cargo away from endolysosomes.  The emergence of LRO biogenesis pathways likely result from the poorly understood interplay of general endolysosome trafficking factors expressed in all cells with key regulators that are only present and active within LRO-containing cells.  To identify and investigate the function of these regulators, the project is analyzing the biogenesis of C. elegans gut granules, cell type-specific LROs that co-exist with conventional lysosomes.  Some LRO biogenesis factors identified in this system have cell type restricted expression and likely regulate the diversion of cargo to LROs.  The research addresses the function of one of these, GLO-3, which is proposed to redirect the function of CCZ-1, a RAB-7 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), away from conventional endolysosomal pathways, toward the GLO-1 Rab to regulate LRO biogenesis.  The research will involve detailed phenotypic analysis of mutants, yeast 2-hybrid screens, and in vitro GEF assays.  The research will examine whether expressing GLO-3 and other LRO biogenesis factors are sufficient to direct the trafficking of LRO cargo away from conventional endosomes in cell types that do not normally generate LROs.  The research will employ a novel genetic resource to identify nearly all of the genes necessary for LRO biogenesis in C. elegans."

The Pacific Northwest is a prime location for developing innovative Earth Science teacher professional development programs that empower teachers to connect classroom learning more directly to place and demonstrate the relevance of Earth Science to everyday life. Teachers on the Leading Edge (TOTLE) is a professional development program designed to engage K-12 teachers and their students in the geology and geophysics of the Pacific Northwest active continental margin, the leading edge of North America. Teachers on the Leading Edge will engage K-12 teachers in field study of plate margin geology in the Pacific Northwest, its past and present plate tectonic processes, and the societal implications of this geologic heritage, from understanding climate change to potential geologic hazards. Through a problem-solving approach to active continental margin geology, TOTLE teachers will gain experience and protocols for geologic inquiry, a regional geologic sense of place, the ability to engage students in learning ""their geology"", and appreciation for how geologists developed our current state of understanding and are advancing frontiers of knowledge through projects like EarthScope. Program themes include: (1) Convergent margin processes from great earthquakes to continent building through volcanism and terrane accretion; (2) Earth System Science using the John Day Fossil Beds to investigate a 30-million-year record of faunal and floral succession and paleoclimate changes; (3) geophysical studies that illuminate the geology beneath the tree-covered landscape and provide an introduction to EarthScope's USArray and Plate Boundary Observatory experiments; and (4) geologic hazards as aspects of living on the leading edge of our continent. A guiding principle is to make TOTLE invitational, accessible, and useful to K-12 teachers so they can carry Pacific Northwest geology to learners of Earth Science at a wide range of educational levels."

Transcription is repressed in              diploids, (a/d repression); it is activated in haploids, but only               those which have undergone cell division (mother cells).  Finally,              activation of HO transcription is restricted to the late GI phase               of the cell cycle (cell cycle control).  UAS elements in distinct               upstream regulatory regions (URS) mediate mother/daughter control               (URSI) and cell cycle control (URS2).  These UAS elements can act               automonously to activate HO transcription when they are physically              separated from each other.  However, within the context of the HO               promoter, neither UAS is sufficient to activate transcription.                  Deletions which remove URSI from the HO promoter prevent HO                     transcription.  In addition, mutations in either of two regulatory              proteins which specifically mediate transcription from the UAS in               URS2 also eliminate HO transcription.  Such results imply the                   existence of an additional negative control region within the                   intact promoter whose action is only overcome when both URSI and                URS2 are active.

The rotational perturbation exhibits a time-dependent pattern which links it to the Sun's magnetic activity cycle.  Comparisons of the torsional pattern with the cycle-related patterns of meridional flow and magnetic field suggest that it is actually made up of three separate phenomena, and that each is the result of Coriolis forces.  These three are: (1) a polar spin-up associated with poleward meridional flow to a downdraft at the poles at the time of polar field reversal; (2) a migrating zone of enhanced shear associated with meridional flows to a downdraft overlying the toroidal field band that gives rise to the active regions of the cycle; and (3) an equatorial slowing due to an updraft at the equator that feeds a poleward meridional flow.  The principal investigator and students will examine these and other scenarios that have been proposed through the analysis of data taken in two spectral lines at Mount Wilson since 1986 and with data taken in the GONG and SOHO programs.

While much has been learned regarding the diverse and important processes that lysosomes carry out in cells, the mechanisms underlying the assembly of lysosomes in complex multicellular animals, especially as they develop during embryogenesis, are relatively unstudied.  To aid in understanding of these processes, Dr. Hermann is identifying and characterizing genes necessary for the assembly of lysosomes in the embryonic intestine of the model multicellular organism C. elegans.  The Hermann lab has identified gut granules as a cell type specific, lysosome-related organelle that functions in the storage of fat.  To gain detailed insight into the mechanisms controlling the formation of gut granules the Hermann lab has isolated and is characterizing a collection of glo mutants that are defective in gut granule biogenesis. Most genes identified to date that function in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles are not required for embryonic viability. The Hermann lab has identified 22 embryonic lethal glo mutants that extracellularly mislocalize gut granule contents.  The genes necessary for the formation of gut granules whose activity is disrupted in these strains will be molecularly identified.  Studies of these genes are likely to provide novel insights into the pathways necessary for lysosome biogenesis in multicellular organisms.   Recent studies in C. elegans suggest that yolk platelets and LMP-1::GFP containing compartments in the intestinal primordium also represent lysosome-related organelles.  Whether LMP-1::GFP containing organelles, yolk platelets, and gut granules have characteristics of conventional lysosomes, other endosomal compartments, or each other will be investigated using microscopic and genetic approaches.  If these three compartments represent distinct lysosome-related organelles, the embryonic intestine would provide a powerful genetic system to investigate how structurally and functionally distinct lysosomal compartments are formed in the same cell.<br/><br/>The project will involve 25 to 30 undergraduates a year in independent, hands-on, original research.  Undergraduate students working in the PI's lab and upper division Cell Biology course (enrollment 24) will carry out the studies.  The work will provide molecular insights into the assembly of lysosomes likely to be conserved in the assembly/maintenance of lysosomes in all multicellular animals."
