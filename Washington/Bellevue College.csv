The proliferation of information in electronic and print media demands the efficient application of research and communication tools and the ability to apply critical thinking in their use. To provide students with skills that will enable them to process information effectively, educators must ensure that all students are grounded in critical thinking and information literacy .<br/><br/>To meet these needs, Bellevue Community College proposes to build and institutionalize a program that infuses critical thinking and information literacy across the curricula using interdisciplinary topics based on scientific concepts and science-related issues as a vehicle for developing skills that will assist students throughout their educational and professional careers. Towards this goal, following are the proposed objectives of the project: (1) Refocus the Information Literacy Across the Curriculum project to use interdisciplinary scientific concepts and issues as vehicles for the integration of critical thinking and information literacy into the curriculum. (2) Equip faculty and students with critical thinking and information literacy skills that will empower them with the skills needed to fully function in the global information environment; (3) Develop an understanding of personal, institutional, and public policy issues as they relate to information literacy; (4) Develop an environment to foster collaborative efforts between faculty, students, information technologists, and librarians.<br/><br/>To accomplish these objectives, BCC has developed an institution-wide leadership panel to ensure wide-spread participation and dissemination. The Information Literacy Across the Curriculum (ILAC) project was funded by BCC to pilot the concept 0f incorporating information literacy into the curricula of various disciplines. The current proposal (CTILAC) is providing faculty with the tools to incorporate critical thinking and information literacy skills as they deal with scientific concepts and science-related issues in their courses. Faculty and students will be provided knowledge and skills to use technology effectively in their research activities. Methods of instruction include workshops, symposia, electronic courseware, tutorials, ongoing technical support, and peer training and assistance.<br/><br/>Collaborations with the University of Washington UWired program, the NorthWest Center for Emerging Technologies and the Regional Advanced Technology Education Consotium will ensure dissemination of the methodologies developed in the project as well as findings on student success and learning experiences.<br/><br/>Critical Thinking and Information Literacy Across the Curriculum is conceived as an ongoing, fully integrated project leading to infusion across the campus.

As technological workforce needs multiply and skilled workers become increasingly difficult to find, this effort becomes ever more critical to the health of our national economy.  The employer needs for right-skilled graduates is well-documented.  For example, in its most recent survey, the Manpower Group found that nearly half of employers are having difficulty filling US jobs.  In addition, they report that, for the 6th consecutive year, skilled trades positions are the hardest positions to fill.  When asked why they were unable to fill roles, almost half of employers point to a lack of applicants or a lack of applicants with the necessary hard or soft skills.  Mitigating such disparities between workforce needs and worker skills are important goals of community and technical colleges.  Strong industry partnerships are fundamental to this work. When done well, these relationships stimulate exchange and dialogue between institutions and employers that, in turn, ensure program currency, alignment with workforce needs, awareness of industry trends, and the production of graduates who are right-skilled and work-ready. Strengthening these beneficial collaborations is not only critical for the grantees of the National Science Foundation's ATE program, but for all colleges and programs that wish to advance technological education and expand opportunities and pathways for students and the communities in which they serve. <br/> <br/>The Engaging Educators, Strengthening Practice project team has investigated education-industry partnerships across the ATE community and has found that 78% of PIs have received no training or support for forming or maintaining industry partnerships.  In addition, none mentioned instruction or guided development of an industry partnership action plan or support for the execution of such a plan. This project will develop curricula that supports educators in establishing and sustaining industry partnerships. The curriculum will be delivered during in-person workshops and webinars. Workshop participants will construct an industry partnership action plan based on research and best practices, as well as aligned with their specific organizational goals. The project will: 1) Develop curricula that supports educators in establishing and sustaining industry partnerships; 2) Facilitate the use of a rubric for partnership assessment/evaluation; 3) Provide professional development workshops and webinars to guide the use of the materials and to build participant community; 4) Establish online learning exchanges for post-workshop participant knowledge transfer, support, and collaboration;  5) Adapt workshop materials for online reference and use by participants and others; and 6) Disseminate the tools, findings, and outcomes of these efforts via the project website, conference presentations, published reports, and webinars. The project website and resources will be designed to ensure that they are accessible by all users, including those with disabilities. All appropriate resources will be archived with ATE Central to ensure sustainability.  This project is funded by the NSF Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through this twenty-four month project, the NorthWest Center for Emerging Technologies (NWCET) and its partners identify and catalog Washington state IT workforce demands, as well as available IT educational programs.  This gap analysis leads to the development of new IT programs and, with state support, to the strengthening and updating of existing IT programs.  This project also leads to ""turnkey"" solutions that allow educational institutions to rapidly launch or enhance IT programs.  Additionally, this project enhances the scope and value of NWCET activities by accelerating the rate and expanding the impact of the work of the NWCET and the Regional Advanced Technology Education Consortium (RATEC).  The result is the development of a nationally adaptable, statewide ""Best Practices"" replication model."

The new framework can be used to determine what IT skills and capabilities technicians in a variety of business positions need to perform their functions well.  The framework helps educational institutions and businesses to meet the needs of swiftly changing areas such as manufacturing, medical informatics and information assurance.  During the one-year project, the staff and the partners develop a few models for frameworks and create, test and refine one framework model and populate it with select IT and IT infused occupational categories."
