The training program is being offered in partnership with school districts in Baker, Columbia, Dixie, Gilchrist, and Union Counties, although students from other counties in north Florida and South Georgia are eligible to attend. The MaST Excel Program is actively recruiting a diverse pool of STEM professionals, encouraging the participation of underrepresented populations. A cohort of fifteen, high quality applicants completes the program each year, resulting in 60 new math and science Teachers of Excellence by the end of the four-year stipend program.<br/><br/>Stipend recipients are participating in an innovative, competency-based alternative certification program, gaining practical experience with lesson planning, classroom management, and research-based Cooperative learning strategies. A special Math and Science Teacher (MaST) component facilitates the integration of real world math and science into the classroom. Extensive cohort development, mentoring, and follow-up supervision is helping participants successfully transition from STEM professional to student to teacher, increasing both the number of math and science educators and quality of regional K-12 math and science learning outcomes. Data from the evaluation program is being used to continually improve program elements and assess the ultimate impact of the program on local math and science education in high need schools."

The organic students learn the fundamentals of the instrument and develop first-hand understanding of the principles underlying organic reactions and separations. A Winner Workstation Integrator has been purchased for storing and reporting of data. This workstation includes an integrator and assorted computer hardware and software. A second channel of this workstation is used to interface both gas chromatographs. The results of the project include the improvement of the use of instruments and computers to extend instructional capabilities and an improvement of the education of the undergraduates in science. The institution is providing funds in an amount equal to the award."
