Device capabilities such as wireless networking enhance functionality, but increase risks associated with threats to cybersecurity and patient safety. Skilled technicians trained in the manufacturing, installation, repair, networking, and security of medical devices are in high demand throughout the healthcare industry on a national scale. However, current Biomedical Engineering Technology (BMET) education must evolve to capture students at every point along the educational pathway and to address skills gaps for new and emerging medical device technology. To address these needs, St. Petersburg College will leverage connections with national industry advisors to implement the BMET Pathways program. BMET Pathways will expand the current BMET Associate of Science degree at St. Petersburg College to incorporate new stackable certificate pathways, including an innovative Networking and Cybersecurity certification. Embedded in these certificates will be new micro-credentials tied to industry-recognized competencies.  Such certificates allow incoming students with specialized skills, such as veterans, to earn credit for prior learning while also providing current students with verification of skills for rapid employment without a degree. BMET Pathways will also strengthen the employment and training pipeline by supporting education initiatives from K-12 through articulation to multiple baccalaureate degrees.<br/><br/>BMET Pathways will advance knowledge by addressing two primary goals: 1) establish a sustainable pipeline of trained biomedical engineering technicians and 2) expand educational and career opportunities that are responsive to industry demand. The project will utilize senior faculty from Biomedical Engineering, Engineering Technology and the College of Computer and Information Technology to create: (a) a minimum of 15 micro-credentials, (b) three new college credit courses, (c) three new industry-recognized certificates, and (d) a minimum of three Associate to Bachelor of Science degree articulations to support enhanced learning. A new BMET laboratory will allow students to gain hands-on experience in a simulated healthcare environment. Industry partners will provide internship opportunities and ensure that training and competencies remain responsive to cutting-edge skill needs. Evaluation of the program includes assessment of student retention and completion data both at St. Petersburg College and across other NSF-funded institutions to demonstrate effectiveness of flexible degree pathway options. Results from the project will be disseminated at the local, regional, and national levels through presentations at conferences.  Open-source curriculum sharing with partners will also take place and lead to greater global gains in BMET education and boosting the number of technician degrees in the Tampa Bay area and beyond."

Specifically, the investigators at St. Petersburg College, Manatee Community College, and Seminole Community College, in conjunction with other collaborators from education and industry, are developing a three-tier model for postsecondary cybersecurity education, which incorporates educational materials and curricula that are directly linked to widely recognized cybersecurity skill standards and industry certifications. The skill standards are those developed by the Information Systems Security Certification Consortium, Inc. ((ISC)2), the National Workforce Center for Emerging Technologies (NWCET), CompTIA, and the National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Committee (NSTISSC). The industry certifications are the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), the Security+, and the Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP).<br/><br/>Through this project, valuable educational materials for the CISSP certification are being made available to colleges nationwide. The three-tiered educational program provides multiple entry and exit points for students with various academic backgrounds and work experience. The program is structured to enable students to advance from a credit certificate to an A.S. degree to an Advanced Technical Certificate to a Bachelor of Applied Science degree, and ultimately to a university master's degree, without loss of credit. The CompTIA Security+ and SSCP certifications are integrated at the A.S. degree level, and the CISSP certification is integrated at the Advanced Technical Certificate and bachelor's degree levels. This curriculum uniquely combines an industry certification with a college degree, resulting in much stronger qualifications for graduates than they would have with certification, a college certificate, or a college degree alone.<br/>"

The Tampa Bay Bridge to the Baccalaureate Alliance (TB-B2B) focuses on activities that provides effective educational tools and resources to prepare underrepresented minority (URM) community college students for successful transfer to and completion of STEM baccalaureate degrees. <br/><br/>TB-B2B will use a holistic system to recruit and strengthen students' preparation for STEM baccalaureate programs by focusing on: 1) awareness and outreach to encourage enrollment into the STEM pipeline through informal learning events, digital marketing and social networking; 2) intrusive guidance, deep engagement activities and experiential learning opportunities to retain students using STEM Learning Communities, including dedicated advising, peer and faculty mentoring, undergraduate research, internships and job shadowing; 3) academic supports to fortify math foundations, inclusive of math-based adaptive learning tools and summer bridge programming; and 4) transfer guidance to encourage matriculation to STEM baccalaureate programs. Faculty learning communities and professional development workshops complete the framework, ensuring an institutional shift in URM student outreach, preparation, retention and transfer. A comprehensive evaluation allows for greater evidence demonstrating the efficacy of these interventions.<br/><br/>TB-B2B is led by St. Petersburg College in partnership with State College of Florida Manatee-Sarasota and Hillsborough Community College, a Hispanic-Serving Institution, and the University of South Florida System as an informal partner and point of transfer.

The project will help 80 participants to take part in an employment-centered curriculum that includes job shadowing and internships, while at the same time providing them with integrated academic and career advising, access to tutoring centers, a project-specific orientation, and career mentoring.  A unique feature of the project is a ""road map to graduation"" plan that each student makes in concert with Campus Faculty Champions who will also act as recruiters, mentors, and activity coordinators.  The road map will help students to identify curricular goals, determine when and if they should use academic support services, and make plans to investigate STEM careers.  In order to broaden participation, students are recruited through local high schools and the Pinellas Education Foundation with an emphasis on inclusion of women, students from under-represented racial/ethnic groups, and veterans.<br/><br/>Data generated through assessment and evaluation is expected to support the rationale that when students participate in faculty-guided decision-making and have substantive industrial experiences they are retained in STEM majors and are more likely to matriculate into four-year college or choose STEM careers.  Formative and summative evaluation focuses on measurable outcomes (% retention and graduation), the impact on curricular changes, and the extent of industry/faculty/student interactions.  Student enrollment records, placement test scores, course grades, graduation and demographic information are tracked.  Dissemination of the project results provides a model for improving retention through multidisciplinary support and intensive planning.  The project team plans to present their work at meetings of the Florida Academy of Science, the Florida Chapter of Mathematics Association of America, and the League for Innovation in the Community College among others.  Project deliverables include the results of summative evaluation and initiatives to address the local STEM industry workforce needs by educating and training a skilled STEM workforce."
