Our proposed center, COSEE Florida: Water as Habitat, will build statewide connections with Florida's ocean research community. This project will provide professional development opportunities for scientists to improve their ability to communicate the value and importance of their science to nonscientific audiences and achieve a better understanding of their role in supporting STEM education.<br/> <br/>Founding partners for COSEE Florida are the Indian River State College, the Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce, the Ocean Research & Conservation Association, and the Florida Institute of Technology.  Our content theme ""Water as Habitat"" is engaging and appealing to students and the public and will allow us to place naturally charismatic marine organisms and ecosystems within a systems framework linking physical, chemical and geological ocean processes to biodiversity, marine ecology, climate change, threats to human health, and stewardship actions. COSEE Florida will advance ocean science literacy through the implementation of three strategic initiatives: <br/><br/>1. Professional Development Workshop Series for Scientists: Ocean scientists will participate in workshops to improve their effectiveness in communicating their research to non-scientific audiences. COSEE staff will also provide assistance to scientists who wish to develop quality outreach programs to broaden the impact of their research. Six workshops will be conducted around the state each year. <br/><br/>2. A new Ocean Science Concentration for Pre-Service Educators: Ocean science focused educational content will be added to the Bachelor of Science STEM Education degree for middle school science at Indian River State College in Ft. Pierce, Florida. Students will participate in a suite of courses, research opportunities and high quality practicum situations. The program will be disseminated to additional State College campuses in year 5. <br/><br/>3. COSEE Florida Ocean Science Learning Network: This initiative is the linchpin that brings scientists, educators and the public together to communicate and collaborate. Water As Habitat events will feature ocean-based interactive presentations, educator workshops, and opportunities for continued participant engagement at regional nodes throughout the state. On-line communication tools will be developed to facilitate post-event collaborations and resource sharing. At least five regional Learning Community nodes will be established around the state. <br/><br/><br/>Our work will engage a spectrum of people and organizations from across Florida. Ocean researchers, higher education faculty, informal education institutions, educators and the general public will participate in a wide range of activities. Through our initiatives we will (1) involve up to 90 Florida ocean scientists in effective outreach and education each year, (2) expand the skills and strengthen the ocean science content of at least 200 pre-service undergraduates, 100 in-service teachers and 100 informal educators over a 5 year period, (3) improve the ocean literacy of over 3000 Florida residents and tourists and (4) learn from and contribute to the work of other Centers in the National COSEE Network. <br/><br/>The ocean science content of our programs will draw on current research findings from Florida's leading ocean scientists (Intellectual Merit) and significantly expand public awareness of the significance of their work (Broader Impacts). Scientists will also develop a deeper understanding of the challenges facing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) education today (Intellectual Merit) and contribute to improving the quality of teaching and learning in Florida through the integration of cutting edge research into K-16 education (Broader Impacts)."

The list of key biochemical ?gatekeepers? for activation of the reproductive system from fishes to humans includes two important protein hormones, Gonadotropin-releasing hormone and kisspeptin, that function in the brain. This project would investigate how social cues affect these hormones in the brain of an animal model system that is particularly powerful for revealing connections between the social environment and the reproductive system. This animal model is the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), a fish species that has been the subject of many foundational studies of environmental influences on reproductive function. This project will use molecular neurobiology methods to map the gonadotropin-releasing hormone and kisspeptin signaling systems in the brain of the bluehead wrasse, in order to compare the expression of these hormones across different reproductive phases, and to test the effects of manipulating these hormones on reproductive function. A key element of the project is to provide undergraduates from North Carolina State University and Indian River State College in Florida with experience in behavioral field studies and molecular biological laboratory studies. A second benefit will be an increased understanding of the control of reproduction in fishes because the bluehead wrasse is a particularly useful animal for understanding the specific mechanisms of this control. This knowledge is valuable to the aquaculture industry because the control of reproduction represents a key barrier to the propagation of fishes in captivity. Finally, this project will lead to the development of educational materials focused on Florida marine environments in collaboration with the Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence. Gene sequences will be archived in Genbank and cDNAs will be provided to interested parties on a cost-of-transport basis."

Materials are being developed for both teachers and  students.  The teacher supplement contains examples and  instructions on how and when to effectively use a graphing  calculator as an instructional tool.  Less emphasis is placed on  traditional lecture and more emphasis is placed on exploration and  group problem solving.  The material integrates practical  applications taken from astronomy and physics and other areas that  use mathematics.  Students generate real data through the use of a  Calculator Base Laboratory System (CBL).  The device enables the  collection of real time data for analysis with the graphing  calculator.  The collection and analysis of real data provides the  means to integrate practical laboratory experience into pre-  calculus and calculus.  The instructional materials include the use  of the CBL system.    The student supplement is designed with an emphasis on using  technology to explore mathematical concepts and write about the  findings.  Projects address four types of activities: (1) ""get  started"" activities to familiarize students with using the  calculators; (2) activities to help students understand concepts;  (3) projects to promote deeper understanding of concepts that may  be used as group projects or for advanced students; and, (4)  investigation projects for topics beyond what is discussed in  class.  This range of activities will benefit the slower student by  providing activities for understanding as well as the advanced  student by providing enrichment material.  The conceptual approach  combined with real applications, emphasis on understanding and  problem solving benefits all students."

They are fueling innovations in medical instrumentation, photonics integrated circuits, telecommunications technologies, laser additive manufacturing, remote sensing, analytical instrumentation, and other industries. The economic impact of light-based technologies on the U.S. gross domestic product was $7.5 trillion in 2010. The Department of Labor projects that 1,710 LFO technicians will be needed annually between 2014 and 2024. U.S. colleges with LFO and photonics programs produce only 300 technicians annually. The demand is almost six times the supply. This project will support the education of the workforce needed to keep the U.S. as the world leader in laser and fiber optics enabled technologies.<br/><br/>The ATE Regional Center, LASER-TEC, proposes to continue developing the LFO workforce for the southeastern U.S., and will expand the current network of 21 partner colleges. The industrial corporate network will increase to include companies from different sectors of the economy. The goals are to: 1) Increase and strengthen LFO academic programs to meet industry demand; 2) Create and offer LFO professional development programs for secondary school teachers, college faculty, and incumbent workers; 3) Develop LFO curriculum materials for secondary schools, colleges, and industry; 4) Develop, promote, and deliver outreach and awareness programs to secondary STEM teachers, advisors, counselors, and administrators; 5) Develop strategies and materials to recruit and retain underrepresented groups to promote diversity in LFO programs; and 6) Identify and disseminate LFO technicians' skillsets and employment needs in the southeastern U.S. LASER-TEC is working with AIM Photonics, Power America, Advanced Functional Fabrics of America, and other Manufacturing USA Institutes to provide the workforce education and training as new technologies are developed."

COSEE Florida is designed to engage Florida's ocean scientists in education and outreach through professional development activities, while Upward Bound's goals are to increase the rate at which participants complete secondary education and enroll in and graduate from post-secondary institutions. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop and implement effective strategies and programs for connecting role models from the ocean sciences community with >1000 college-bound students involved with Upward Bound each year. By working with the Upward Bound program, there is an opportunity to support students from underserved communities as they make the critical transition from secondary to post-secondary education. For the planning effort, a steering committee of 6 professionals from the scientific and education communities will select 20 representatives from the ocean sciences academic community, Upward Bound program, minority undergraduate and graduate student populations, and higher education administration officials focused on diversity efforts, to participate in the workshop and help to develop a path forward. This project serves the NSF and GEO Directorate goals of broadening participation in STEM fields, in general, and in the geosciences, specifically."
