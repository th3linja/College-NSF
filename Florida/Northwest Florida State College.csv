The cornerstone of the course is a series of field sampling activities using a combination of field analytical instruments and web-enabled GIS products to assess, in real-time, spatial and temporal variability of biogeochemical parameters in a local estuary. Teams of students are collecting data using handheld multimeters to perform field analyses for physical parameters (temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen) and separate portable colorimeters to measure biogeochemical parameters (nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate). Students are using field laptop PCs to upload water quality data (via a wireless network card) to a GIS webserver, maintained at a nearby four-year university, the University of West Florida (UWF). The data from all sampling teams are compiled by the GIS server and used to generate GIS layers that graphically depict the spatial variability of water quality parameters using the entire data set. While still in the field, these GIS layers can be immediately accessed by students and instructors to obtain a whole basin view of spatial variation in water quality parameters. These summary results are used to generate and test field hypotheses or to facilitate in-the-field comparison with historical data collected during previous semesters and stored on the field laptop. The Aquatic Environmental Science course is a component of Physical Sciences in the Science Department at NWFSC. The target audience for this course includes students enrolled in an AA program and students enrolled in the Middle School Science Teacher Program for pre-service teachers. The major field sampling component of the course is designed to meet a number of goals related to both STEM disciplines and technical workforce training by creating an experiential learning activity based on field data collection. Specifically, the new course has field and classroom components that provide students with the opportunity to use a variety of field technical equipment within the context of an ecological assessment. The goal of this combination is to simultaneously address STEM learning and technical aptitude within a field-based project. The proposed field activities also are being used as an articulation opportunity to introduce two-year college students at NWFSC to GIS technology and environmental sciences. By collaborating with a UWF there are opportunities for recruiting NWFSC students into baccalaureate and graduate programs. The field activities also are being integrated into a workshop for regional in-service high school science teachers."

This assembly will be an important first step in building a community of Ocean 2YC faculty, a group with no previous assemblage or identity. A session on ?Opportunities and challenges of teaching introductory oceanography to undergraduates? will be co-chaired by Jan Hodder (COSSEE-Pacific) and PI Beauregard. It will focus on effective ways to teach and assess student learning in these classes. The session is not geared specifically for two-year college faculty but would also be of interest to four-year college faculty. This may provide a nice mechanism for interaction between these groups. Additionally, Jan Hodder, Heather Macdonald, Eric Baer (Highline Community College), and Bob Blodgett (Austin Community College) will host a workshop on successful ways to prepare community college students for geoscience careers as part of their NSF-funded ?Supporting and Advancing Geoscience Education (SAGE) at Community Colleges (2YC)? project. Finally, COSEE Pacific will support an evening reception for Ocean 2YC participants. The reception could include a discussion of opportunities and resources for 2YC geoscientist faculty, as well as challenges and needs specific to the Ocean 2YC community. <br/><br/>Travel assistance will be limited to faculty who either present at the meeting or who attend the SAGE-2YC workshop. Participants in this project will receive airfare, subsistence, and registration to attend the ASLO meeting in February 2013 in New Orleans, LA.<br/><br/>Community colleges are a critical part of our educational system, and serve almost half (or approximately 7 million) of all U.S. undergraduate students, 32% whom are under-represented minorities (National Science Foundation, 2008). Yet, community college faculties rarely have access to professional development funds that allow for national conference attendance and the critical interactions that lead to higher quality instruction (Geo2YC Workshop, 2010). Community college oceanography faculty face some startling challenges in their classrooms, including lack of access to current scientific research, lack of expensive equipment, and an extremely large range in student interest and abilities in one course section. <br/> <br/>Intellectual Merit: This project is a crucial first step, toward building an Ocean2YC community. Such a community will provide a forum for sharing ideas and strategies for teaching oceanography at two year colleges, such as innovative ideas for incorporating research into two year classrooms, teaching non-majors, and transfer issues with four year colleges.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Half of all students receiving baccalaureate degrees in the U.S. attend a community college at some point in their educational career (AACC, 2012). A strong community of community college oceanography instructors to share effective teaching strategies will lead to better instruction and increased participation in the ocean sciences. Because these institutions serve a disproportionate number of minority and first generation college students, effective teaching at community colleges will have the additional benefit of increasing diversity in the ocean sciences."

The workshop will focus on teaching ocean sciences at Two Year Colleges (2YC) and the conference is a bi-annual, joint meeting that brings together a large percentage of the national and international oceanographic science community.  <br/><br/>Community colleges are a critical part of our educational system, and serve almost half (or approximately 8.2 million) of all U.S. undergraduate students (National Science Foundation, 2012). Further, these programs serve a substantial portion of minority students, with 32% of students enrolled in community colleges being an ethnic minority and 61% being female (American Association of Community Colleges, 2012). Yet, community college faculties rarely have access to professional development funds that allow for national conference attendance and the critical interactions that lead to higher quality instruction (Geo2YC Workshop, 2010). Community college oceanography faculty face some startling challenges in their classrooms, including lack of access to current scientific research, lack of equipment, and an extremely large range in student interest and abilities in one course section. <br/><br/>In order to encourage teaching of ocean sciences at 2YC and the development of connections between 2YC faculty and ocean scientists, a workshop on teaching oceanography will be held prior to the conference and a session on ""Undergraduate ocean science education in the 21st century: an exploration of successful practices"" will be held during the conference. This effort also contributes to the development of educational communities that will make use of Ocean Observing Initiative data."
