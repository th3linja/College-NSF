This will be particularly advantageous for this community college environment where the costs of sophisticated instrumentation is prohibitive. Using interactive multimedia computers, the investigators will develop videodiscs containing both full motion video and still images as well as interactive courseware to teach proper sampling and instrumentation techniques. Properly designed interactive multimedia is a proven instructional method that works in teaching sampling and instrumentation techniques. ***"
