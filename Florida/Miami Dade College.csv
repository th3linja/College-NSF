Projects supported by the HSI program will also generate new knowledge about how to achieve these aims.  This project will advance the aims of the HSI Program by adding course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) to introductory algebra, biology, and chemistry courses, which serve as gateways into STEM majors.  This project is a collaboration between Miami Dade College, the largest two-year HSI in the nation, the University of Florida, and the University of Miami.  The project predicts that the addition of CURES will enhance the undergraduate learning experience, thus supporting increases in the number of students obtaining associate degrees in STEM disciplines and in the success of students in transferring to four-year institutions. The project will identify factors for increasing retention and completion rates in STEM degree programs for undergraduates, including Hispanic and underserved students. The project seeks to enrich the STEM workforce by increasing the number of trained STEM professionals.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to increase undergraduate persistence and completion in the STEM degrees through the adoption of CURE-infused STEM gateway activities. This project aims to improve understanding of how integration of CUREs and other educational supports in gateway courses will affect retention and completion rates of undergraduate students. Faculty will participate in professional development activities to incorporate CUREs into STEM gateway courses in mathematics, biology, and chemistry. The CUREs in gateway courses will be designed to enhance the student experience by engaging students in contextualized learning with real world experiences. The students in the CURE-infused STEM courses will devise their own investigations, write a scientific research paper, and present their findings at a public poster session. The senior undergraduate students and graduate students from the University of Florida and the University of Miami, along with the faculty from Miami Dade College teaching the gateway courses, will lead authentic research laboratories at Miami Dade College. Through curricular enhancement, together with faculty professional development, this project seeks to 1) increase the percentage of STEM students enrolled in CURE-infused STEM gateway courses in the disciplines of mathematics, biology, and chemistry; 2) increase the number of undergraduates continuing from a first to a second sequential STEM course; 3) increase the number of undergraduates completing a STEM associate degree in three years; 4) increase the percentage of students successfully transferring into STEM baccalaureate programs; 5) increase the number of STEM faculty teaching CURE-infused STEM courses; and 6) increase the number of students participating in CURE-infused STEM courses. By collecting and analyzing quantitative and qualitative data, the project can generate new knowledge about the factors that stimulate student persistence and completion in STEM at the Community College level. The project seeks to develop a model for integrating CUREs into the STEM curriculum that could be useful to other institutions, especially Hispanic-Serving Community Colleges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

ACE enables low-income, minority, and/or female students, who meet established academic criteria, to obtain Associate in Arts (AA) or Associate in Science (AS) degrees in biological, physical, or mathematical sciences, computer and information sciences, geosciences, engineering, and technology areas associated with them. These students are then eligible to transfer to a university or enter the workforce directly. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This collaboration of seven Miami Dade College (MDC) campuses brings together a diverse and experienced group of educators, students, and business partners, including local science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) firms. By capitalizing on MDC's successful experiences with mentoring and outreach, this program continues to broaden participation of underrepresented students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Student support services include: (a) mentoring by faculty from STEM disciplines; (b) Web portal for students to communicate with each other, their mentors, and project personnel; (c) academic and career planning for scholarship recipients; (d) opportunities for students to interact with STEM professionals on and off campus; and (e) internships for scholarship recipients <br/><br/>Broader Impact: Project ACE helps to alleviate the critical shortage of scientists and engineers in the Florida Department of Labor targeted occupations for Miami-Dade County. Since MDC awards the most associate degrees of any college or university in the country to both Hispanics and African Americans, and has a student body that is over 50% low-income, the project provides opportunities for under-represented and economically disadvantaged students. Participants make an economic contribution to the community and serve as role models for other students."

The Cybersecurity Opportunities and Methods that Promote Access and Student Success project at Miami Dade College in Florida aims to meet this need by increasing the diversity of students entering the cybersecurity workforce. The project aims to (1) improve the understanding and evidence base regarding learning approaches and their impact on retention and completion of underrepresented students; (2) improve industry engagement through involvement with curriculum development; (3) increase the knowledge base on the effects of competency-based summer camps that result in industry-certification and continuation into a cybersecurity-related degree program of study; (4) increase recruitment, retention, and completion of underrepresented students in cybersecurity programs; (5) increase the number of students who complete a College Credit Certificate and/or an AS in cybersecurity who are employed in industry; and (6) create dual enrollment pathways that retain cybersecurity majors from high school to two-year colleges. The program will share pedagogical best-practices for underserved populations across the Miami Dade College system; with the surrounding school systems; via the National CyberWatch Center; and with other institutions across the nation, including existing and emerging Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Minority-Serving Institutions. and Historically Black Colleges and Universities. <br/><br/>The project will adapt and evaluate materials and methods developed through the ATE National Center in Cybersecurity, CyberWatch, and other ATE projects. It aims to increase the number and diversity of students who complete a state approved one-year College Credit Certificate (CCC) and a two-year Associate in Science degree in cybersecurity.  The overarching goal is to create the foundation for a seamless pipeline across two critical educational transitions: high school to college and college to workforce. The project aims to achieve this goal by implementing and evaluating the following objectives: (1)  building the capacity of college faculty and high school teachers to provide relevant and up-to-date education in cybersecurity; (2) integrating instructional approaches into cybersecurity curriculum that have been shown to be effective in engaging and retaining diverse students; and (3) creating pathways into cybersecurity degree programs through dual-enrollment opportunities, a competency-driven boot camp, and certificate programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
