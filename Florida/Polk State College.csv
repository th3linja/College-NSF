In the OEOE format, course objectives are divided into single credit hour units that can be scheduled to fit time constraints of students. The program addresses the needs of working students and provides a learner centric focus. Through outreach activities, student interest in advanced manufacturing and enrollment in the program is increased. <br/><br/>The OEOE format is modeled on other successful programs but tailored to fit the local constraints within the Florida College System. NSF sponsored ATE Centers are partnered with Polk Community College to assist with the curriculum development efforts. The project is responsive to local industry needs and has industry involvement throughout the planning and implementation. Students can also be placed in industries to obtain practical experience and by collaborating with four year institutions; the project is enabling students to transfer to four year schools to continue their studies. <br/><br/>The OEOE format and a partnership with the Polk County Public Schools enable secondary and college instructors to strengthen their knowledge of Advanced Manufacturing principles by completing selected units of study. This instructor development ensures a strong sustainable program."

Three recombinant DNA labs                 will be added to the current Microbiology and majors'                           Principles of Biology courses taught at Polk Community College                  to reinforce lectures on biotechnology theory and provide                       students immediate exposure to reecombinant DNA techniques.From                 these new labs the student will learn the following:  to                        prepare and run an agarose gel, perform restriction analysis,                   produce competent cells, transform bacteria, perform proper                     measurement techniques to confirm data, and develop the                         critical thinking necessary to quantitative biology. The                        addition of new biotechnology laboratory exercises will                         strengthen several existing undergraduate courses."

The project has four key elements: (1) a 2+2+2 articulation plan beginning in high school, transitioning to a community college, and completing a bachelor's degree in IT; (2) a distance education option with curricula based in part on workplace competencies identified by business partners; (3) active learning opportunities using Linux clustering and virtualization that provide students access to remotely served networks on demand from almost any location and platform; and (4) a cross-institutional open source course management system to provide students with consistent distance learning experiences and greater opportunities for interactions among and between students and teachers at participating institutions.<br/><br/>The LINCS project improves student learning in computer science and engineering education programs by increasing student access to hands-on application experiences through remote access virtual labs.  It also increases access to a geographically diverse population of potential students, many of whom would not otherwise be able to participate.  The project leverages already established strengths of the participating institutions with a long history of collaborations with the business community.<br/><br/>The resulting prototype being developed serves as a national model for technology education because it creates an educational pathway into the IT field and supports life long learning opportunities.  A community advisory board comprised of IT business partners plays an integral role in the project, including: identifying necessary skill sets; field-testing of course content; and providing field experience opportunities for students. All products (learning units, curricula, infrastructure design, and best practices) are being made available on the LINCS wiki site to facilitate replication by other institutions."
