Tallahassee Community College is a public two-year community college where 41.8% students are classified as low-income students. Over its five-year duration, the project will fund two-year scholarships to 60 students who are pursuing Associate of Arts degrees in the disciplines of Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Computer Science, all disciplines of Engineering, Mathematics, Physical Science, Physics, as well as Computer Information Science and Technology. The project aims to increase retention and degree completion for students through both academic and non-cognitive skills development. The project will advance knowledge on targeted effective practices including: (1) active learning and research experiences, (2) optimized individual advising, (3) faculty mentoring, (4) tutoring, (5) internships and career counseling, and (6) non-cognitive skill development that prepares students to pursue STEM careers. The project will use the ""Growth Mindset"" framework which posits that intelligence and academic success can be improved over time with effort, and with the development of particular skills. By deepening the understanding of the ""Growth Mindset"" in STEM, this project will advance a more nuanced framing of challenges and factors for success in low-income community college students pursuing STEM degrees. This approach will help students develop a determined mindset when facing academic challenges and will lead to an increase in the retention of students in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The project seeks to improve educational opportunities, enhance student support services, and employ the ""Growth Mindset"" framework to increase retention and degree completion of students in the STEM fields. In addition, the project will create a predictive model which identifies factors that affect student success in STEM disciplines. The project aims to study the effect of the enhancement of non-cognitive and psycho-social skill development on increasing student success. Furthermore, the project will analyze if specific activities can be identified as influential factors for the increase in student success. The project will be evaluated by collecting student data on GPA, semester-by-semester grades earned, retention, and graduation rates. In addition, through non-cognitive surveys and questionnaires the project will seek to observe and understand how changes in the ""Growth Mindset"" of students occurs. Dissemination will be conducted through presentations on the findings of the project and the identified best practices will be shared through national conferences and publication journals. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, the project will gather data about former students, including institutional data (such as grades) and information from surveys and interviews.  The data will include information about students who completed the program, who did not complete the program, and who changed programs or transferred to other institutions.  These data will be analyzed to identify potential pathways and critical junctions that may lead to student success or other outcomes. The research team from Tallahassee Community College and Florida State University expect that this approach will reveal opportunities and hindrances students face as they pursue credentials in information technology. <br/>   <br/>This project aims to test the potential of integrating institutional data with phenomenological data to model student progression through post-secondary STEM programs, specifically information technology.  Framed by Tinto?s model of student attrition and persistence, it will use a mixed methods sequential exploratory design with multiple layers of data collection and analyses that merge and examine institutional data and alumni phenomenological experiential data.  It expects that this analysis will identify and verify influencers that support or hinder student success. Quantitative data analyses will consist of descriptive and comparative methods, which will be verified and informed by open coding and thematic analysis of the qualitative data.  The systematic investigation of institutional and phenomenological data has the potential to: (1) generate practical knowledge about academic/career pathways in information technology for use by stakeholders; (2) identify and examine relationships among these pathways, students experiences, and psychosocial factors; and (3) add to the analytical methods available to institutional research professionals to document, investigate, and visualize student pathway information using data dashboards.  Four Florida community colleges that collectively serve rural and urban student populations (Pensacola State College, Florida State College at Jacksonville, Chipola College, and Gulf Coast State College) will pilot test the efficacy and usefulness of the method for modeling and visualizing their students? college and career pathways.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The SET project partners include Leon County Schools, Wakulla County Schools, Daytona State College, Florida State University College of Engineering, FLATE, and regional employers. The project is developing a career pathway in ET in manufacturing that leads to a diverse population of students entering the program at different stages. Entry points include high school dual-enrollment, the community college, 4-year institutions and incumbent workers through co-operative education programs. The project is providing multiple exit points to support student educational career needs that include credit certificate programs, associate degrees or baccalaureate degrees. The SET project is stimulating learning by offering educational opportunities that far exceed current curriculum options. By providing concentrations in a variety of technical areas as well as an emphasis on contextual, practical training and education methods, this project is encouraging the study of ET in manufacturing with the outcome as either a technician in industry or continued progression into a four-year ET program. This project is broadening the participation of underrepresented groups by an aggressive high school campus presence with mentoring and advising of students and parents. Further, summer bridge courses and technology camps are providing continuity in the education process, a valuable marketing tool to attract future students for program sustainability and intensive practical experience for all student participants."
