Daytona State College is partnering with the University of Central Florida's Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC) in the development and delivery of this program, which involves recruiting and attracting current Daytona State College STEM students and the regional workforce community.<br/><br/>The project team and partners in the development of the summer institute have conducted a thorough review of existing curricula from the Arizona State University NSF-ATE and SMART projects among others and have mapped the summer institute curriculum to the standards established by the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP), the leading certification organization for professional installers in the field of renewable energy. <br/><br/>The summer institute is meeting the emerging industry standards and is assisting students in gaining employment in the RE/EE field and providing certifications, thus allowing them to move-up in their current fields. Training is heavily interactive in nature. The activity is increasing the number of nationally certified solar systems installers. Additionally, this project provides a foundation for a follow-on study on certification validity. The PRISM center and its partners act as a demonstration site for regional technical training and certification."

Started in 2000, iTEC is a collaboration between Daytona Beach Community College (DBCC) and Seminole Community College (SCC), promoting and providing Information IT education to community college faculty throughout Florida and an estimated 40,000 IT workers in Central Florida.<br/><br/>iTEC made significant progress in its first three years with five stated goals: <br/>1) Adapt, integrate, and develop information technology curricula; <br/>2) Provide seamless K-16 articulation with multiple occupational exit points; <br/>3) Provide training and professional development for community college IT faculty; <br/>4) Leverage industry partnerships to validate curricula through incumbent worker training; and <br/>5) Develop dissemination programs to recruit students with special emphasis on under-represented populations.<br/><br/>To date, iTEC has enhanced skills for more than 300 community college IT faculty, upgraded training laboratories and curricula, increased participation among underrepresented populations, and created an approach that leverages resources between<br/>SCC and DBCC to train IT workers. iTEC established a collaborative and industry-centered foundation for developing IT workers and created relationships between academic, government, and industry partners to leverage community college resources for training IT professionals. Nationally and regionally, the supply of skilled IT workers continues to fall behind demand and iTEC is leveraging the resources and capabilities of community colleges to fill the gap. The vision of iTEC is to have companies throughout Florida and beyond recognize and use community colleges as primary, cost-effective, and comprehensive resources for fulfilling IT education and development needs.<br/><br/>iTEC goals are to: <br/>1) continue strengthening the foundation for training community college IT faculty;<br/>2) develop, assess, and propagate a Collaborative Industry Education Model for leveraging community college resources to prepare IT professionals;<br/>3) continue to develop curriculum and programs at the community colleges in response to industry needs; and<br/>4) incorporate elements to ensure more involvement and articulation of courses and programs by high schools and four-year institutions (2+2+2 programs). <br/><br/>The proposed activities have intellectual merit by advancing knowledge and industry-leading practices for community college faculty and IT professionals; developing a comprehensive, creative approach for delivering IT education and assessing impacts; building upon a model collaboration; addressing a national need for proficient IT specialists; and helping college faculties remain current with ever-changing IT skills and content.<br/><br/>Anticipated broader impacts include developing an approach for consistently advancing community college faculty and IT worker skills that can be emulated by academic and industry partners throughout America; broadening the participation of underrepresented groups through focused outreach and joint initiatives with industry and government partners; enhancing the infrastructure to deliver cost-effective, comprehensive solutions to industry; enhancing curriculum and tools for training IT specialists; and contributing to competitiveness of America and technological stature in the IT arena."

S-STARS will provide 82 scholarships to students pursing Associate degrees in STEM fields and an additional 22 scholarships to students with associate degrees that subsequently pursue baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields over the five-year project. Student success will be supported through multiple interventions. Faculty mentors will be assigned to each scholar, and professional staff advisors will provide intensive academic advising. Internships in local industries will enable students to directly explore career related to their fields of study.  Student cohorts will create a shared experience opportunities for peer-to-peer support. Targeted use of digital communication and social media tools will ensure student access to important information and encourage their continued engagement with faculty, advisors, and other students throughout the program. With an average student body age of 27 years, the large non-traditional population at Daytona State College has the potential to add to the STEM workforce a pool of students with more life experience than traditional undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The goals of S-STARS are three-fold. The project focuses on increased retention, student success (as measured by GPA, time to completion, rates of job placement), and completion (as measured by graduation and/or transfer) of low-income, academically talented students in STEM fields. The project implements, studies, and adapts the use of effective evidence-based practices to enhance success among participants. In addition, S-STARS contributes to broader understanding of how strategically selected and combined curricular and co-curricular supports can be used effectively in the community college setting among a diverse population of low-income students. S-STARS scholars are expected to experience higher rates of retention, program completion, transfer to additional post-secondary study, and/or job placement in comparison to students not participating in S-STARS. The project builds upon existing collaborations with other institutions in the Florida College System. Project outcomes will be shared with those institutions as well as the Florida Advanced Technical Education Engineering and Technology Forum and through presentations at the American Association of Community Colleges annual conference and other STEM-related professional meetings."
