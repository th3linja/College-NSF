It will do so by providing scholarships and other supports to twenty high-achieving, low-income undergraduate students at Seminole State College.  The Scholars will pursue Associate of Arts degrees in biology-related fields.  The project will provide Scholars with supports to increase their success in introductory and higher-level biology courses.  Scholars will also receive a customized guided pathway of coursework that is aligned with their academic and career goals.  Other supports include research opportunities and mentoring by faculty who have cultural responsiveness training.  The project expects that these supports will decrease the amount of time Scholars need to achieve a transferrable Associate of Arts degree.  It also expects that Scholars will be more likely to successfully transfer to four-year institutions, where they will earn four-year degrees.  Seminole State University has an ethnically and racially diverse student body, as well as a high proportion of first-generation and lower-income students.  By increasing academic success of a diverse group of Scholars, this project will contribute to building a stronger and more capable STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need.   The specific aims include increasing the: 1.  Success of Scholars in first semester biology; 2. Enrollment and success of Scholars in upper-division biology courses; 3. Retention and graduation rate of Scholars; and 4. Successful transfer and post-transfer success of Scholars.  Beyond the impact on Scholars, the project expects the proposed project activities will improve the STEM learning environments at Seminole State, thus benefiting many students at the college, particularly those from underrepresented groups.   The project will generate new knowledge through program evaluation and through replication of a 2014 research study by Harackiewicz and colleagues, which focused on increasing the achievement of first-generation students in college biology.  Data collected through these efforts will contribute to the body of knowledge about the complexities of implementing high impact education practices that help diverse STEM students succeed. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To achieve this goal, a number of important objectives are identified: <br/>          1. Creating Teaching Strategies incorporates an innovative partnership between a two-year institution and a research university through adaptation of the infrastructure of a successful NSF funded STEP program (EXCEL) at the partnering research university to better fit a two-year institution's setting. This is being achieved by developing a team-taught, STEM-interdisciplinary course sequence. The courses in this sequence are Applications of College Algebra, Applications of Trigonometry, and Applications of Pre-Calculus.<br/>          2. Developing Faculty Expertise at the community college by working jointly with EXCEL faculty and the Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning (FCTL) at UCF. <br/>          3. Creating a Learning Community of Learners and Scholars from SCC and UCF with the common goal of enhancing the mathematics abilities of college underclassmen through emphasizing applications of mathematics. This is further reinforced by the creation of a center on campus for these students. At the center students have a ""home base"" on campus where they may engage in group study and receive tutoring in their mathematics and applications of mathematics coursework. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The collaborative effort is designed to implement and test educational practices at the community college, modeled after the EXCEL program. The effect of this educational model applied to diverse environments of learners and scholars (SCC and UCF) contributes to the knowledge base of undergraduate STEM education and advances identification of best practices in teaching mathematical applications to diverse student populations (community college and university students). <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The university/community college partnership established in this project is intended to be a pilot program for future implementation at other universities in partnership with neighboring community colleges to improve mathematical foundations of STEM undergraduates. Because a significant number of the nation's community college students are from groups underrepresented in STEM fields, similar programs at community colleges all over the nation would broaden STEM participation among underrepresented groups."

For the two-semester course, 10 content modules and a supplemental skills toolkit have been developed. Each module consists of activities designed to encourage active student engagement using the following models: inquiry and experimentation activities (Explorations), reinforcement exercises (Dialogs), expanding-the-concept activities (Extensions), assessments (Ranking Tasks), and Application ( which require groups of students to solve engineering problems involving several physics concepts). This project is: (1) conducting a full-scale field test (2) developing three additional modules needed to meet the needs of many technology programs, and (3) implementing a dissemination plan with a commercial publisher. The full scale field test of ICP/21 involves participants from the high school, two year college and four year college teaching communities. An external coordinator is responsible for all aspects of the field test. The results of the field test are used to improve and strengthen the ICP/21 modules. The test also gives data and information related to the success of module implementation in the classroom, and the impact it has on the students in understanding the concepts of physics. <br/><br/>During the first phase of the ICP/21 project, physics teachers have repeatedly asked for additional modules in physics areas not covered in the original 10 modules. As a result of this input, three new modules are being developed: electrostatics, fluids, and physical optics. The third component of the project is to conduct a major dissemination program for ICP/21. This is being done in conjunction with a commercial publisher, Ztek. Ztek is a publisher that specializes in electronic media for physics and physical science. Because of the innovative nature of the ICP/21 material, most instructors will need training or assistance in using it in the classroom. The role of the instructor is much different when using the ICP/21 material properly than when in a traditional classroom lecture format. During the field testing and initial implementation this will be done through workshops. <br/><br/>Evaluations are being done by an independent evaluator, who has been the evaluator during the first phase. The evaluation is concentrating on three areas. The first is to monitor the modules and make sure they fulfill what was promised in the first phase of the project. The second is to evaluate the efforts of this phase, and determine its effectiveness for student learning. The third area will be to evaluate the effect of ICP/21 on students' attitudes and feelings about physics. This information will complement the field test results to give a complete picture of the effect of ICP/21 on student learning.<br/>"

This algebra-based course will be modular since its genesis is  the Principle of Technology Modules developed in the 1970's.  ICP/2  will be available in hard copy, but IBM and MAC versions on CD-ROM  will be emphasized since it will allow the instructor using the  material to edit it before printing for classroom use.       The new curriculum will incorporate what is now known, through  studies in cognitive science, about teaching strategies that will  improve student learning.  The modules will be developed to  introduce activities designed to enhance a student's conceptual  understanding and ability to make connections to related ideas.       Introductory College Physics 2000 will target the students in  technology courses, although it will be suitable for all college  students.  With the introduction of TechPrep and similar programs,  more technology students are taking college physics.  Each module  in the new curriculum will use modern technological devices to  introduce the physics concepts.  This will motivate the  technological students and help them see the connections between  physics and their chosen fields.       This college physics course will maintain a rigor that will  make it highly transferrable to universities.  It will emphasize a  hands on approach and will introduce all the major concepts of  introductory physics.  However, it will be the philosophy of ICP/2  that it is more important for students to fully understand fewer  basic concepts and have confidence in applying them to new  situations than it is for them to be exposed to more ideas that are  neither understood nor remembered.       Project ICP/2 will involve consultants and two other community  colleges in Washington and Pennsylvania During the first year,  advisory boards and other writing centers would be formed."

The objective of this project is to move away from ""cookbook"" lab exercises and directly involve students in both experimental design and data collection. We feel that this approach will increase student participation in and enjoyment of lab sessions and we predict improvement in the students' understanding of metabolism as measured by departmental examinations. We also hope to increase student retention in introductory courses and to improve the students' chances of success in the more advanced courses offered by the department. In the proposed laboratory sessions students will design and carry out experiments to answer questions related to enzyme function, cellular respiration, fermentation and photosynthesis. They will be required to make use of the scientific method and to explain their experimental design and results to others through in-class presentations, thus giving the students an active role in learning these difficult concepts."
