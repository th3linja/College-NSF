At the same time, there is a pressing need in the state of Florida to expand access in rural areas to high-demand occupational training, educational best practices, and state-of-the-art educational infrastructure. This project will increase the accessibility of technical education for rural and underserved Florida residents, with a focus on the skills needed to operate a modern data center. One product will be the curriculum for a new Network Enterprise Administration technical certificate. After students have completed this program of study, they will be eligible for a number of high-skill, high-wage, high-growth jobs, including Computer Network Architect, Computer Network Support Specialist, Computer Programmer, Computer Systems Analyst, Computer User Support Specialist, and Network and Computer Systems Administrator. Partners in this project include Florida State College at Jacksonville, Daytona State College, Eastern Florida State College, Seminole State College, Tallahassee Community College, and the National Convergence Technology Center (an Advanced Technological Education [ATE] national center). Fourteen business and industry partners will work with the educational institutions to develop the curriculum, train faculty, and provide opportunities for students.<br/><br/>This project builds on a prior NSF ATE grant (Award DUE-1104234, ""iNoVATE: A Network Virtualization Project""), which resulted in the creation of a Network Virtualization technical certificate, over 100 community college faculty completing professional development in network virtualization, and over 100 students enrolled in newly developed network virtualization courses. The new project will create online curricula for five courses that align with the Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert (MCSE) server infrastructure certification, along with two additional courses, ""Virtual Internship"" and ""Virtual Capstone."" Major project activities include (1) designing, implementing, and disseminating the curriculum for the new Network Enterprise Administration technical certificate; (2) expanding Network Enterprise Administration labs, where students can remotely access equipment to practice server administration skills; (3) developing and offering workshops and other teaching resources for faculty; and (4) disseminating information about the Network Enterprise Administration program to rural and underserved areas. As online education becomes more common, it is imperative that distance learning students gain remote access to authentic, hands-on learning opportunities. Therefore, the project will build on prior research to explore the impact of remote access to virtual lab activities and other authentic, work-based learning, including student internships and capstone course requirements. The project team will measure and track student knowledge construction and the development of discipline-specific problem-solving skills for statistical comparison and longitudinal analysis, improving project strategies and building a strong foundation for future research."

The Bosch group estimates that more than half of all cars first registered in 2017 came with at least one advanced driver assistance system (ADAS).  Examples include rear collision warnings, parking assist, emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitoring, and lane keeping assist.  The deployment of ADAS in vehicles is expected to continue to grow over the next 10 years. This project aims to produce workforce-ready ADAS technicians for the automotive industry by adding instruction on ADAS systems and diagnosis to the College?s automotive technology associate degree program and developing an ADAS technician certificate. This project, backed by industry and academia, will be designed to educate graduates who are skilled in ADAS methodologies and, thus, fill a gap in the modern automotive workforce.  As a result, it will contribute to the national need for a highly capable advanced technological workforce.<br/><br/>This project intends to improve student learning in science and engineering technician education by: 1) developing up-to-date ADAS-intelligent vehicle course content; 2) implementing an ADAS technical certificate program tied to a relevant industry credential that was developed in partnership with national automotive credentialing organizations; 3) acquiring autonomous vehicle simulation and ADAS lab training equipment; and 4) obtaining hands-on ADAS vehicle diagnostic trainers and autonomous vehicle mini-labs.  These curricular improvements and new equipment will enable students to learn fundamentals of ADAS systems and diagnosis including sensor technology such as Light Imaging, Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), wireless systems, radar units, ultrasonic transmitters, and steering angle sensors, as well as to use the same equipment that they will use in industry settings, including ADAS camera alignment fixtures with scan tools.   Project impact and success will be evaluated through performance-based techniques, using a mixed methods quasi-experimental design to analyze qualitative and quantitative data about project components.  This information will be used for ongoing project improvement.  Materials and learning objects developed by the project will be disseminated via the Center for Automotive Technology, the North Florida Transportation Planning Organization, the Florida College System, Advanced Technological Education Central, and other channels. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
