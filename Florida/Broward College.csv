The pilot will prepare 6 full-time STEM faculty and 10 part-time adjunct STEM instructors to shift to evidence-based teaching. The 6 faculty will redesign their courses during a 6-week summer professional development institute.  The new innovative approaches to teaching science courses will be disseminated to<br/>10 adjunct faculty, also through the use of summer workshops. A particular strength of the project is its unique theory of change that includes the part-time adjunct instructors as a central element of its transformation plan. This college already provides professional development opportunities to adjunct instructors through the Adjunct Faculty Institute. Because many community colleges depend significantly on part-time adjunct instructors, this model is important to develop and investigate.  The participating faculty and instructors will be supported by learning assistants. The learning assistants will be drawn from former students who have already earned their degrees and are working as tutors at the Broward Academic Success Center. The work will be guided by an advisory committee that includes external experts.  <br/><br/>The project will be assessed to determine the impact of the course redesign effort on student success and student learning. The project will also investigate how changes in student behaviors and attitudes are related to improved learning and grades and how those relationships vary with the type of undergraduate student."

The college offers bachelor's and associate degree programs and certificate programs.  A 2+2 program in Environmental Science offers an experiential learning curriculum which combines general cognitive and workplace knowledge with applied science and industry specific skills. This five-year project entitled ""Scholarships Targeting Recruitment of Individuals for Degrees in Environmental Science"" (STRIDES) is selecting 30 high ability, low-income students recruited from one of three cohorts chosen to participate in a new bachelor's degree program which has BioSecurity as one focus. Students complete an internship, independent study or a research project as part of the program. The program is developed in response to an unmet need in the geographical region for biological/environmental science graduates. Program staff work with local companies to provide internships, job shadowing, industry mentoring and jobs for students. <br/><br/>Research focuses on a study of retention rates via analysis of various aspects of the problem such as financial assistance and the level of Perceived Education Support (PER) with a comparison of community guided research versus faculty guided research as parameters. The program provides students a combination of campus based and field activities which reinforce learning through individual and group work. The college's Academic Support Centers (ASCs) offer academic support, tutoring and career exploration programs. STRIDES students work one-on-one with subject matter experts located in the newly established STEM Center to deepen conceptual knowledge and understanding. Tutors working in ASC's are required to attend training to become certified in order to practice. Faculty who are active members of professional societies and community research receive training in the mentorship of students. The Management Team comprises faculty, STEM administrators, a Support Services administrator and a researcher. Project evaluation(both formative and summative)is accomplished by both internal (BC's Institutional Research department) and external experts (MN Associates). Program assessment occurs at the end of each semester. The database tracks year to year retention and graduation rates for women, minorities and transfer students. Data from prior years serves as a benchmark for success in improving retention and graduation rates."

This tendency to compartmentalize knowledge effectively negates the inherent interconnections of ""real-world"" problems. In today's information age, we need to teach our students to exploit the vast amount of information available by providing a global overview that stresses the importance of the interconnected parts. One of the objectives of this project is to reverse the tendency to separate academic disciplines by demanding that students engage in studying problems of a multidisciplinary nature using technology as a tool. Broward Community College (BCC) will accomplish this objective by implementing a curricular reform which integrates the disciplines of Mathematics, Science, Engineering, and Technology (MSET) into a comprehensive curriculum. Students in the MSET-Web will interact in the completion of multi- course projects that share common goals. Interaction will be facilitated by the creation of an Exploration Center where students will work cooperatively with other students, faculty, and variouq businesses and government agencies. Through these projects students will engage in the collection, analysis, image processing, and modeling of field data. The Center will also serve as a virtual meeting of the minds through the establishment of an Intemet Homepage for the compilation and dissemination of information generated by the projects in the MSET-Web. This initiative is an affirmation that an understanding of the interconnections of knowledge is more important than the independent pieces. This new approach to learning through integration will significantly impact future learning at the college level. Inclusion of teacher re-certification courses in this initiative will also help disseminate this innovative approach to learning to precollege students. Graduates at all levels will be capable of extrapolating concepts from one area of knowledge to another, and therefore b e better prepared to succeed in the real world."

The diverse student population that will benefit from the project includes over 30% Black and Hispanic students and over 60% female students. In the Microscale Organic Laboratory, the spectrometer will be used by students week after week to analyze products and characterize unknowns. This will give them concrete reinforcement of lecture topics related to infrared spectroscopy.  Interested students will analyze byproducts of the reactions they run, and will be asked to adapt a synthetic route found in the literature to the microscale level. Among other ways, the impact of the project will be evaluated by monitoring student progress throughout their post community college education. The emergence of microscale chemistry over the past decade has led to a regular feature on the subject in the Journal of Chemical Education. This is an excellent forum where successes from the project, such as new or adapted microscale techniques, will be disseminated to the scientific community."

The purpose of this project is to make chemistry less intimidating and more approachable by introducing a medium into the Laboratory that student are familiar with - computers.  The hands-on experience of laboratories has traditionally been an invaluable aid in clarifying concepts presented in class.  This project will enhance this important aspect of chemistry by allowing experimental data be recorded directly to a computer hard drive via a computer interface to the laboratory instrument.  The analysis and subsequent graphing can thus be accomplished quickly by the computer so that students can observe graphically the results of their experiments.  Computer simulations further enhance the hands-on experience by allowing student to change the initial reaction conditions and quickly observe the effect of these changes as displayed graphically.  This combination of real and virtual laboratories accommodates different learning styles and increases the students' understanding of chemical concepts.  This in turn stimulates their imaginations and entices further exploration of chemistry.    The project impacts nearly 1,800 students during the two year period of the grant.  Improved understanding of chemical concepts should lead to increased student retention and success rates.  The ultimate goal of the project is to create a science literate students who can understand the world around them.  The results of this project will be disseminated through the electronic media such as LabNet as well as through professional meetings and articles in the literature.    *"

Although students have been exposed to sophisticated technology in their daily lives, they have a difficult time grasping abstract biological concepts.  They also lack the ability to collect, collate and analyze data.  The purpose of this proposal is to enhance laboratory experiments by creating a virtual laboratory.  Software in this laboratory will allow students to extend laboratory exercises to include variables not examined in their ""hands on"" experiments.  Computer simulations will be used to perform experiments requiring quantitative data analysis.  Students will have to ""collect"" collate and analyze their computer-simulated data.  Students will perform virtual experiments that are not currently included in the non-majors' biology laboratory because of time constraints or the lack of necessary equipment.    Computers with internet capability and commercially available software will be used to establish the virtual biology laboratory.  Software designed by faculty to meet our students' specific needs will be introduced in the future.  Internet access will be available for students to collaborate with other institutions in the design and implementation of three virtual experiments.    This project will influence nearly 2,000 students during the two year period of this study.  The project will increase students' understanding of biological concepts, increase critical thinking skills and stimulate the imagination and interest of our students.  This project will increase retention of students enrolled in this course and lead to an increase in overall science enrollment.  Results of this study will be disseminated through meeting presentations and in appropriate journal articles."
