This project includes three goals as an extension and expansion of FLATE's efforts to: implement a statewide unified education system for manufacturing so that manufacturing education is a convergent curriculum that optimizes technician preparation; provide an effective outreach platform for high school, community college, industry, and legislature access, providing information about the requirement for and impact of manufacturing education in Florida; and present professional development opportunities for STEM educators to develop, refine, and certify their knowledge within manufacturing and its enabling technologies.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: FLATE's focus is on three important areas: (i) Curriculum: The Associate of Science (A.S.) degree in Engineering Technology has integrated the national MSSC-CPT certification and the Manufacturing Skills Standards Council Certified Production Technician credential.  This represents the first statewide articulation for a national industry credential. (ii) Professional Development:  The Engineering Technology Forum is an exemplary model for collaborative professional development. The Forum meets at different Florida State and Community Colleges with a flexible agenda that meets a variety of needs within the College system. (iii) Outreach:  The Made in Florida campaign is FLATE's award-winning dissemination platform that uses as its public information window www.madeinflorida.org . Made in Florida is a comprehensive combination of industry tours, videos, STEM student/teacher summer camps, career pathways, recognition awards, student-focused web site, outreach/dissemination events, FLATE FOCUS (a monthly newsletter), and statewide advertorials that are all partially supported by Florida industry.  <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: FLATE makes a significant impact on the broader aspects of technical education in Florida. It has developed a method for filtering course, certificate, and degree program content that the Florida Department of Education has delegated to FLATE to apply to new Engineering Technology- based program submissions. FLATE has demonstrated an effective way for community colleges to work directly with Workforce Florida - supported Banner Centers in order to optimize technical workforce education and training efforts statewide. It has included the Manufacturers Association of Florida in an awareness campaign that is instrumental in elevating manufacturing careers as necessary for Florida's economic well being. It has also created a pathway to the ET A.S. Degree program that allows high school students to earn 15 credit hours toward the A.S. Degree."

This  experience will involve students, under the direction of participating faculty in: the research  of the culture of aquarium live rock; the environmental monitoring of live rock culture and  harvesting activities; the aesthetics of live rock presentation; and the economics and  marketing of live rock aquaculture. Recent federal and state restrictions have constrained  the collections of natural live rock (a $10,000,000 year business) in all state and federal  waters. Only aquaculture offers a viable solution to revitalizing this business in the  continental United States. Students and faculty, with the assistance of partners, will work  in three teams (Aquaculture, Environmental and Marketing) over a three year period to  address the research concerns mentioned above. Students working in each team will not  only gain applied experience of the particular team discipline but will be provided with the  opportunity of transferring and applying what they learn in the classroom to an applied  project. They will also not only gain the cognitive knowledge/skills of the other team areas  but will gain interpersonal/team working skills by working closely with the members of the  other teams and partners. Evaluation of the project will be accomplished by: traditional  and alternative assessment measures of student achievement such as grades, project  assignments, field assignments, testing, etc; student satisfaction surveys; responses to  research questions and reports; and by yearly reviews by the HCC Aquaculture and EST  Advisory Committees, and the project partners. Knowledge gained from the results of this  project will be made available to the aquaculture industry, the regulatory community and  educational community by workshops, reports and other publications ."
