Yet, high paying, high demand jobs in the geosciences and the need for diversity in these fields means these students may miss an opportunity to put their interests in science to work. This is especially true of students beginning their undergraduate education at two year institutions, which are play an ever increasing role in the landscape of higher education.  Nearly 54% of minority students in STEM begin their undergraduate education at a community college, making efforts to engage and support such students and better prepare them to transfer to and succeed at 4-year institutions is so important. The Geoscience Engagement and Outreach (GEO) project promotes progress in science for students through the recruitment, mentoring and support of a cohort of two-year college students from underrepresented populations. Activities include faculty mentored research in a sub-set of geoscience subdisciplines, as well as skill building for careers to produce graduates prepared for the expectations of future employers. Documenting the potential of cross-institutional, integrated research and education experiences being developed through this project for retaining diverse students in the geosciences contributes to the literature on STEM recruitment and retention. The project also is expected to increase the number and caliber of faculty available to mentor undergraduates and foster continued education in the geosciences.<br/><br/>The GEO project is addressing barriers to engagement, recruitment, and retention of diverse students in the geosciences pipeline through an innovative three-institution collaboration that combines and leverages the strengths of Santa Fe College, a two year teaching institution; the University of Florida, a four year research institution; and the Orlando Science Center, a nonprofit informal education and outreach venue.  The GEO project offers students authentic geoscience research experiences explicitly integrated with practical applications and scaffolded to classroom work. Project goals include: (1) fostering retention of the participating GEO students at Santa Fe College and transfer into Bachelor's degree programs in the geosciences, (2) strengthening collaborations among Santa Fe College teaching faculty, University of Florida researchers, and Orlando Science Center informal science educators, and (3) increasing student interest in geoscience careers through public outreach development of resources for in-service teachers. GEO's three phases of seminar-style teaching, research mentoring with outreach project development and delivery, and a culminating capstone experience scaffold the program elements into an emerging geoscience Associates degree at Santa Fe College. The project is designed to support three annual cohorts of 6 students each, with integration of peer- and supervisor-mentoring and collaborations among the three institutions.  The project is targeted toward recruitment of underrepresented populations and their retention in geoscience fields. University of Florida faculty are mentoring student research in the geoscience sub-disciplines of meteorology, soil hydrology, and geoscience and STEM education. The Orlando Science Center is supervising a paid 6-week summer internship that emphasizes communications and outreach skills development. GEO students are designing and conducting outreach with diverse public audiences, teachers and high school volunteers through OSC's Otronicon. Continuation of research and outreach activities during the Fall semester culminates in the completion of a two year degree by GEO cohort students and their transfer to a four year geosciences program, prepared to continue and thrive alongside their four year institution peers. Project evaluation is measuring student content gain, using the Geoscience Concept Inventory; in addition, increases in a student's science identity and potential interest in pursuing geoscience careers are being assessed."

Industries in the rural communities served by Santa Fe College in Florida have increasing demand for highly-skilled and effective technicians. To address this need, Santa Fe College will develop educational resources to promote participation in STEM disciplines and awareness of career possibilities in STEM by providing unique experiences for students. The project will design a single multidisciplinary course to engage students in the scientific methods used for research and analysis. Three different versions of the course will be developed to include a hands-on project focused on either guitar building, rocketry, or robotics. The math, technology, and science skills will be woven throughout these student projects. The courses will be offered to students at three rural educational centers. These students include those who are transitioning from secondary to postsecondary education and first-time college students. Many students in these populations are unfamiliar with STEM technician jobs.  The project aims to enhance student abilities and promote interest in career opportunities that will help strengthen the nation's STEM technician workforce.<br/><br/>The objectives of this project will be to: 1) create and implement a project-based Research and Analysis course with three experiential learning project options: guitar building, robotics, and rocketry; 2) provide faculty professional development to ensure consistent implementation of the pedagogy at three rural educational centers; 3) engage a minimum of three local businesses in development and implementation of career exploration presentations and/or videos; and 4) evaluate the change in STEM career attitudes and intentions of program participants through a pre- and post-test research study. Curriculum development will use evidence-based pedagogical practices designed to mitigate stereotype threat and enhance self-efficacy. Building on the work of others, this project will adapt, integrate, and enhance relevant curriculum and resources from other ATE projects, to meet the needs of Santa Fe College's students and community. Because of the rural nature of the participating educational centers, students will include a higher than average percentage of low socioeconomic status students and first-time college students. The project aims to emphasize collaboration with industry partners to better meet employer needs for STEM technicians, and to connect students with industry so they obtain firsthand knowledge of requirements for developing a successful career. The change in STEM attitudes and interest in STEM careers will be measured using a validated pre-post analysis. The results of this project will be disseminated through project presentations and publications, and shared on the ATE Central website.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a first Community College-driven BPC education event, it will bring together theoretical and practitioner perspectives to listen to each other and use an inclusive, more holistic perspective to drive next steps for engaging the Community College community in the BPC movement effort.<br/><br/>Community Colleges (CC) serve a more diverse population than 4-year institutions, so they are a natural but often overlooked venue for increasing diversity. This workshop -- led by a multi-institutional leadership committee with representatives from three community colleges, one research university, and two education research organizations, all of whom are active in CS BP research and interventions --  will develop a conceptual model for increasing the participation of CC in BPC initiatives that leverages existing CC collaborations and investments, including the National Center for Women and Information Technology's (NCWIT) Community College Outreach group, and attendees of the 2017 CISE BP Community Meeting. What is missing from most current BPC CC-focused research or interventions is an understanding of what CC themselves want to know and how they would like to be involved in research and intervention projects. The conversational prompts for this meeting will include:<br/><br/>1. The current state of knowledge on issues that relate to equity and inclusion in computing disciplines at CCs. Some examples of known issues are faculty shortages, professional development, lack of consistent articulation/transfer guidelines, lack of student supports (e.g., financial, remediation) and unclear or disconnected curricular pathways.<br/>2. Identification of opportunities to enable CCs to more fully engage in the national movement to broaden participation in computing. This will include organizational constructs that need to be in place (e.g., administrative buy-in), effective interventions (e.g., culturally responsive and gender equitable teaching practices), relevant partners (e.g., university, industry, K-12) across geographies; and incentives to spur action.<br/>3.

Not only is there a shortage of qualified workers in the field, but there is also a lack of skills among many of those already in the workforce. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of the project is to increase the quantity and capacity of qualified cybersecurity technicians in the workforce. The college is accomplishing this by: <br/>1. Expanding the cybersecurity curriculum offered by the Networking Services Technology program at the college to include an 18 credit hour cybersecurity certificate and an introductory cyber awareness and cyber safety module which is being taught in all entry-level information technology courses both at the college level and at the secondary level. <br/>2. Increasing the diversity of the Networking Services Technology (NST) student population by significantly escalating the recruitment and retention of female students into these programs. <br/>3. Developing and strengthening career pathways from local secondary and rural vocational schools to the cybersecurity curriculum at the college. <br/>4. Providing professional development opportunities for college faculty and collaborating secondary school teachers for building capacity and continued growth in cybersecurity education. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Available curriculum and models from other colleges, many of which were funded by previous NSF grants, are being utilized in development of this project. In particular, a collaborative effort with the Center for Systems Security and Information Assurance (CSSIA) is informing the project with best practices. These models are being applied to the college programs, with modifications to meet the needs of students and the community. Program design is incorporating multiple entry and exit points to facilitate life-long educational and career pathways for technicians already employed in the workforce. New models are being created that can be successfully replicated. Throughout the process, success is being evaluated by tracking the number of cybersecurity graduates, the number of female graduates, and the number of students who articulate from secondary schools into college credit programs. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project is building capacity and strengthening career pathways in cybersecurity between secondary schools and college credit programs. The design is incorporating elements that impact secondary students, teachers, and schools in the two rural counties in the college service district as well as surrounding counties in the region; students and faculty at the college; members of the current workforce in the community who need to retrain or upgrade their skills; and regional employers who need staff with current credentials, training and expertise in cybersecurity, cyber awareness and cyber safety. Best practices for female retention and recruitment, including the development of a female mentoring program and a female post-secondary cybersecurity competition team, are increasing participation by women in computer and information technology programs. Professional development opportunities are preparing secondary teachers and college-level faculty to deliver effective cybersecurity curriculum, and continued professional development opportunities are sustaining their currency for teaching effectively. To ensure the widest exposure and benefit, introductory cyber awareness and cyber safety modules are targeting general computer users and are being integrated into a large number of information technology classes, secondary schools, and online to the general public, employers and other organizations."

Understanding the impacts of global climate change and mitigating its effects will require the concerted effort of geoscientists.  At the same time, our country faces a critical need for people with training in the geosciences to fulfill employers? need for qualified personnel.  The difficulties developing our nation?s geoscience workforce starts early, as most college students are unfamiliar with the various academic disciplines that are a part of the geosciences and the career possibilities for those with training in the geosciences.  Consequently, very few students begin college with an intention to pursue a degree or career in the geosciences.  This proposal expands and develops the pool of students pursuing careers in geosciences by providing mentored research experiences in the geosciences at the critical junction when students are most likely to be deciding their career trajectory.  By providing students at a two-year college the opportunity to receive mentorship from scientists at four-year universities and federal agencies, this program develops the STEM workforce through enhanced education in traditionally underrepresented populations.<br/><br/>Technical<br/>Mentored research opportunities are a proven means to recruit, retain, and advance students in STEM fields, including the diverse disciplines that make up the geosciences, and mentored research therefore provides an exemplary model for developing the next generation of geoscientists.  This mentored research program, called the Undergraduate Coral Research Initiative (UCRI), builds upon the recent discovery by USGS scientists of a unique coral refuge from global warming among the shaded mangrove prop roots in Hurricane Hole, within the US Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument Marine Reserve.  Over the course of three years, at least fifteen students will be guided through all phases of the research process, beginning with developing science literacy skills (Phase I), followed by practical research skills in experimental design, data collection in a marine context, data analysis, and presentation of research findings (Phase II).  Students will play a central role in designing and executing experiments to address the biotic and abiotic factors that promote coral survivorship in some, but not all, parts of this mangrove habitat.  Because coral reefs are a keystone component of marine ecosystems, the work conducted by students will contribute to our understanding of, and ability to protect, coral from the stresses induced by global warming.  Finally, students will be provided a broader perspective of careers in geosciences through geology field skills training with students and faculty at a four-year university (Phase III)."
