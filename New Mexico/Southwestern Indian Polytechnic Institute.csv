Founded in 1971, and acquiring Land Grant status in 1994, SIPI provides higher education opportunities for indigenous people from over 100 different tribes across the United States. The overall objectives of the workshops are to expand SIPI's capacity to provide geospatial training, to expand opportunities for Tribal College and University undergraduate students to engage in scientific research, and to develop an understanding of long-term and large scale ecological research provided by LTER and NEON. The workshops will bring in guest speakers from NEON, and provide training from LTER scientists. Other activities include a visit to NEON HQ and using NEON data in summer courses at SIPI. The summer courses will serve an estimated 80 students from American Indian and Alaska Native tribes. The effort will occur as part of the SIPI Geospatial Information Technology Summer Institute, which has been held since 2000, and was institutionalized in 2004. This summer program will expand science education through this minority serving institution with cutting edge ecological research. Courses held this summer are estimated to serve eighty students from American Indian and Alaska Native tribes with potential for more enrollments in several classes. This effort will expand the number of underrepresented groups engaged in science and technology education and research."

By employing articulation agreements with a wide range of four and two-year institutions, national laboratories and industry, SIPI is providing lower division courses in engineering and in engineering technology allowing participants to go directly into the workforce or continue with baccalaureate programs.<br/><br/>ASEET's comprehensive program design encompasses curriculum development, faculty recruitment, professional development, community outreach, student recruitment, student retention, and career development for the transitions between high school and 2- and 4-year colleges. <br/>SIPI's ASEET program is:<br/>1. Improving Native American student proficiency in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics through the development and revision of science-based academic programs and course offerings.<br/>2. Motivating pre-college Native American students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics by offering seminars, short courses, and workshops onsite and through distance education, engineering survey courses, directed learning experiences and internships as part of SIPI's pre-engineering degree program.<br/>3. Improving science, technology, engineering and mathematics instruction through professional development opportunities and curriculum review and revision.<br/>4. Continuing to build Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute's capacity to develop world-class science and technology knowledge and skills for the technological workplace. <br/><br/>Additionally, SIPI is assisting other tribal colleges in establishing similar programs. Faculty members from other tribal colleges are being encouraged to serve as visiting or adjunct faculty and receive training in the methodology developed at SIPI.  These faculty members are helping to develop teaching materials and methods to evaluate the effectiveness of the pedagogy and curriculum.<br/><br/>"

This will be accomplished through a comprehensive<br/>program, irVision-21le which includes: a) curriculum development in calculus, physics and<br/>chemistry; b) standards-based faculty development in problem-solving instructional <br/>strategies and in the use of instructional technologies; c) two-year student experiences<br/>in research; and, c) an expanded program for networking professionals leading to<br/>industry certification to address the need for information technology workers in<br/>Native American communities.<br/><br/>The project is designed to improve student-learning outcomes in calculus, physics, and<br/>chemistry.  Students will participate in inquiry-based learning strategies delivered through<br/>a technology-enriched curriculum that is delivered/facilitated by a skilled faculty.  Native<br/>American undergraduates will also participate in meaningful research experiences that <br/>will lead to improved diverse career opportunities, particularly in the SMET fields. <br/>Students will learn and write about the research process, and develop presentations<br/>for professional student forums. This is a learning experience that is rarely afforded <br/>to two-year undergraduates. Finally to address the need for certified information <br/>technology professionals in the U.S., and especially among Tribal Nations, SIPI will<br/>expand its networking training program, allowing for industry certification.<br/><br/>Project staff in collaboration with faculty will develop an extensive evaluation<br/>and assessment program.  Staff will encourage and monitor student enrollment <br/>and success in college courses that will prepare students for science, mathematics,<br/>engineering and technology careers.  Curricula products will be packaged and shared <br/>with Native serving institutions, and evaluation and assessment results will be <br/>electronically disseminated.<br/><br/>"

SIPI proposed a comprehensive academic enhancement project, entitled 'Vision 21: Expanding STEM higher education for Native Americans in the 21st century', designed to build capacity among faculty and improve the school's science education infrastructure. Vision 21 Phase I resulted in SIPI being well positioned in three areas. First, we have a well-trained teaching faculty with a broad repertoire of instructional strategies. Second, we have a state of the art science education facility with well-equipped labs across the natural and physical sciences. Third, we have an established undergraduate research experience program with a proven record of enhancing student success. We propose to leverage this strong underpinning with our Phase II request, and have chosen two overarching themes, and 4 goals, which extend our reach beyond the basic capacity building of Phase I. In Phase II we will focus on:<br/>I. Access to higher education<br/>Goal 1 Improve outreach to area schools so as to help students move effectively from high school to SIPI, and on to high-demand STEM careers, through early assessment and better aligning secondary and postsecondary curriculum.<br/>Goal 2. Increase access of Native American college students to science and technology degrees through distance education.<br/>II. Best strategies to prepare students for future careers as technologists, scientists and engineers<br/>Goal 3. Improve curriculum and course offerings within STEM associate degree programs to prepare students to be successful at four-year institutions and/or to assume productive careers in the STEM workforce<br/>Goal 4.
