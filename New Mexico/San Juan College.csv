Della-Piana","08/31/2016","$444,757.00","","Evansv@sanjuancollege.edu","4601 College Boulevard","Farmington","NM","874024609","5055663209","EHR","1796, 1998","9150, 9178, SMET","$0.00","Four Corners STEM Success (FOCUSS) is a collaborative project between Fort Lewis College (a four-year public liberal arts college in Durango, Colorado) and San Juan College (a two-year community college in Farmington, New Mexico), designed to increase the number of students in the Four Corners area who graduate with STEM degrees. San Juan College and Fort Lewis College are geographically close to one another (51 miles apart) and attract many of their students from the same region (western Colorado, northwestern New Mexico, and adjacent parts of Arizona and Utah). Furthermore, Fort Lewis College, which has a tuition waiver for all Native American students, is an excellent transfer destination for the large number of Native American students at San Juan College.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. The project consists of four activities: (1) a joint seminar series that brings career-oriented speakers to both institutions; (2) visits by Fort Lewis College STEM faculty and students to San Juan College, to encourage students at San Juan College to continue their education by transferring to Fort Lewis College; (3) an early undergraduate research program run jointly by both institutions; and (4) a tutor/mentor program for Fort Lewis College sophomores and new transfer students, designed to improve retention between first-year courses and upper-level courses at Fort Lewis College. These activities complement existing programs aimed at retaining first-year students and providing support to Native American and Hispanic students at both institutions, and providing undergraduate research experiences to junior and senior STEM majors at Fort Lewis College. <br/><br/>Broader Impact.  The project is increasing the number of STEM students who continue from San Juan College to four-year programs, and is increasing the number of STEM majors who graduate from Fort Lewis College. At the same time, the project is increasing the number of underrepresented minorities who graduate with STEM degrees because both San Juan College and Fort Lewis College are designated Native American-Serving, Non-Tribal Institutions by the Department of Education, and serve student bodies that are 27% and 20% Native American, respectively."

It will be a cross-state collaboration between Fort Lewis College (FLC) in Durango, CO and San Juan College (SJC) in Farmington, NM. It will deliver highly-qualified STEM teachers to a rural service region that overlaps three states.  This project will provide one-year scholarships to 29 students who have already completed a STEM degree and will pursue Post-Baccalaureate teacher licensure through FLC or SJC.  An additional 15 undergraduate students will be awarded multi-year scholarship support while pursuing licensure in conjunction with a degree in Math, Biology, Chemistry, Geoscience or Physics. This project will address the lack of qualified secondary STEM teachers in the Four Corners area. FCNS will increase the number of these teachers by recruiting and training students who are predisposed to living in rural communities. Then they will place them in high-need communities via student teacher assignments and long-term employment. The first goal of FCNS will be to increase the number and diversity of certified Math and Science teachers in the Four Corners region. Secondly, the project will provide mentorship and professional development to induction year teachers. Thirdly, the project will assess the effectiveness of the program's recruitment and support strategies.  FCNS will develop a recruitment funnel that will expose promising STEM undergraduate students to instructional experiences. Selected students will receive a stipend to take part in summer internships through one of ten community partners in NM, CO, or AZ.  Prior to receiving scholarship support, Noyce Scholars will attend a summer bridge program. This program will build camaraderie, create networking experiences, and address cultural fluency, literacy, and numeracy. These scholars will receive the training and induction year support needed to teach effectively in impoverished, isolated, rural communities with large Native American and Hispanic populations.  A partnership between FCNS and the Navajo Nation Math Circle (NNMC) program will create exciting opportunities to recruit highly-qualified Navajo students into teaching and to provide FLC and SJC students exposure to the Navajo Nation and culture.<br/><br/>Over five years, 44 teachers will complete certification and teach in one of thirteen high-need partner school districts. Starting in their freshman year, undergraduate students at both FLC and SJC will work with middle- and high-school students through activities on their college campus. These activities will include math festivals, chemistry demonstrations, science fair judging, and guiding visits to animal labs.  Sophomore-level students will take their pre-teaching experiences into the schools. They will give sample lessons, tutor, and visit schools. The school visits will include both in-school and after-school programs through NNMC.  Transfer pathways will be developed between SJC (a 2-year institution) and FLC (a 4-year institution). This will allow SJC students to receive Noyce support while completing STEM degrees at FLC. Dissemination of project results will include conference presentations by co-PIs, FCNS Scholars speaking in their home communities, and educational research results being submitted to appropriate journals and conferences.  The project will seek to evaluate the effectiveness of recruitment activities, collaborative arrangements, and pathway alternatives, to generate evidence-based strategies for the preparation and retention of effective STEM teachers in the Four Corners region and similar settings around the U.S.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

MATEC has developed competency based multimedia modules to educate instructors of semiconductor manufacturing technology programs in specific processes and equipment of the semiconductor industry. Embedded in the MATEC model is a learner focus. This project uses the MATEC model to develop Web based experiential laboratory exercises for students in an Associate of Applied Science in Controls Technology and Manufacturing Technology programs. These simulations or experiential modules replace the traditional laboratory exercises of a site based Manufacturing, Instrumentation or Controls Technology curriculum, and instead do them in a Web environment.<br/><br/>The theory components of the curriculum are already commercially available in a digital format and have been satisfactorily tested for past the 5 years at San Juan College. The missing and critical component for effective delivery of the curriculum via distant education is the experiential or hands on laboratory exercise in a format suitable for effective learning in a Web environment. The rapid growth of web-based education and the rapid rate of technology changes in industry and society have created a need for a revised methodology in educational curriculum and delivery. This refocus must facilitate lifelong learning and have a learner driven process. <br/><br/>The project is creating 16 virtual laboratory or experiential modules for two different classes over the two-year life of the project. It is developing a distance education competency based experiential model that can be used to implement the curricular objectives of the traditional 'hands on' or laboratory exercises in the virtual world of a web based program.<br/>"

The first challenge is the need for a hands-on laboratory experience to adequately train technicians. The second challenge is the fact that the teacher is remote in space and/or time. BrainFrame, a new intelligent tutoring system (ITS) software package developed by Stottler Henke Associates, will be adapted to automate the assessment and feedback component of the experiential exercises. The ITS reduces the need for immediate access to a live instructor. This tool will be embedded in the competency based virtual experiential exercises. The 'smart help' of an intelligent tutor will enable the student to get help when needed without having to wait for a response to the course instructor at any time of the day or night. Both assessment capability and feedback are incorporated in the Intelligent Tutor software and model. Research indicates that learners using a virtual tutor compete favorably with classroom-based instruction. The disciplinary focus of the exercises is topics in common between Controls Technology and Manufacturing Technology curricula. The primary activity is the development of competency based experiential exercises for a virtual educational environment. The primary audience is the distance education student of a two-year terminal degree program. Additionally, there are many process plants located far from educational institutions whose employees and prospective employees could greatly benefit from a distance-education program leading to a technical degree."
