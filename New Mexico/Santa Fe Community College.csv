The versatile and powerful simulation game engine, SimBuilding, being developed supports three types of simulation games in both English and Spanish: diagnostics games; construction games; and operation games. These different types of games will support both traditional students as well as building professionals seeking continuing education to improve their knowledge and skills. SimBuilding games allow for learner data to be automatically logged and analyzed to assist in understanding how students learn through the games. From this information, an intelligent tutoring system coaches the student as needed providing personalized learning. An independent consultant works with the project team on research and evaluation of the overall project and on determining the effect of the games on student learning. The SimBuilding games and associated curricular modules are being disseminated through community college faculty workshops, outreach to high school students and teachers, and at national building and green energy meetings and their websites."

The research team will investigate how the implementation and use of online education can or does profoundly change the institutional culture and structure of teaching and learning.  Data collection consists of in-depth semi-structured interviews with faculty and key personal and structured document analysis.<br/><br/>This qualitative research study examines the promise of online education for technicians in advanced technological fields in STEM.  The goal of the research study is to synthesize what has been learned about online technical education in ATE project and make connections to the broader literature about what works and what does not work in online technical education.   The research team will ensure the credibility, dependability, and confirmability of the research findings through an iterative process consisting of triangulation, peer debriefing, and member checking.  Data triangulation involves collecting data with multiple methods.  Peer debriefing involves an outside reviewer examining the data from transcripts of interviews and focus groups and document analyses to ensure that findings and conclusions represent the perceptions/perspectives of the research participants.  Member checking requires that researchers share their findings with research participants to ensure that information was interpreted correctly."

This project also focuses on state-of-the-art GIS curriculum development incorporating work-based SCANS competencies and career-pathways into GIS degree programs. Research-based findings in technology education and minority student success, career pathways and project-based laboratory experiences form the basis for the further development of national skill standards. The objectives for the project include the: 1) Development of a series of work-based laboratory exercises that are employer-driven exposing students to the problems associated with the design and collection of reliable and accurate data sets using GPS and GIS programs; 2) Training of area secondary school faculty in the application of GIS and GPS as they apply to a variety of occupations that incorporate GIS components into current Technical Preparation agreements; 3) Increasing the number of rurally-isolated, minority secondary students who choose to participate in post-secondary GIS/GPS training for employment in currently unfilled GIS positions; 4) Working with the leading GIS and GPS software<br/>companies in the development of industry-based skill standards; and 5) Sharing the curriculum developed with other colleges and NSF.<br/><br/>"
