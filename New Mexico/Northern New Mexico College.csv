The goal of this project is to train students at Northern New Mexico College in effective use of the power of parallel computing in processing and visual representation of large volumes of data. The High Performance Cluster of computers will be used for both and research and educational projects. At least, ten of the faculty at the College will actively use the cluster for research. The PI will model the nanotechnology of semiconducting materials like gallium arsenide and its applications to solar devices. Dr. David Torres, Co-Principal Investigator, will conduct simulations of incompressible fluid flow and surface tension. Surface tension is important in many industrial settings, including casting, fuel injection sprays and inkjet printers. Dr. Cathy Berryhill and Mr. Jean Constant will team up with the PI to conduct research on scientific visualization, including the study of novel ways of displaying information and the effective use of visualization software in the classroom. Dr. Claudia Aprea will use the cluster for research in Earth and Planetary Science and Environmental Science, including work on mapping the subsurface of Mars, on creating a 3-dimensional geophysical model database for the state of New Mexico, and on the mapping the surface of the Earth for scientific or prospecting purposes. Research areas of interest to other faculty include a database of local pollen counts, the design of feedback control systems, the performance of solar photovoltaic systems, and the reliability of computer storage systems. The project will facilitate research, teaching and outreach activities at the host institution.<br/>"

Poverty has led to low educational aspirations and expectations that plague our entire community. As such, its disruption requires a collective effort from our entire community. Our Collective unites two local public colleges, 3 school systems, 2 libraries, 1 museum, 1 national laboratory and four local organizations devoted to youth development. Together we will focus on raising aspirations and expectations in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) topics, for STEM deficiencies among 9th graders place them at risk of dropping out while STEM deficiencies among 11th and 12th graders preclude them from pursuing STEM majors in college and therefore from pursuing well paid STEM careers. We will accomplish this by training, placing, supporting, and assessing the impact of, an indigenous STEM mentor corps of successful undergraduate role models. By changing STEM aspirations and expectations while heightening their own sense of self-efficacy, we expect this corps to replenish itself and so permanently increase the flow of the state?s indigenous populations into STEM majors and careers ? in line with NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science while advancing the national health, prosperity and welfare.<br/><br/>Our broader goal is to focus the talents and energies of a diverse collective of community stakeholders on the empowerment of its local college population to address and solve a STEM disparity that bears directly on the community?s well-being in a fashion that is generalizable to other marginalized communities. The scope of our project is defined by six tightly coupled new programs: three bringing indigenous STEM mentors to students, one training mentors, one training mentees to value and grow their network of mentors, and one training teachers to partner with us in STEM. The intellectual merit of our project lies not only in its assertion that authentic STEM mentors will exert an outsize influence in their communities while increasing their own sense of self-efficacy, but in the creation and careful application of instruments that assess the factors that determine teens? attitudes, career interests, and behaviors toward a STEM future; and mentors? sense of self development and progress through STEM programs. More precisely, evaluation of the programs has the potential to clarify two important questions about the role of college-age mentors in schools: (1) To what degree is the protege?s academic performance and perceived scholastic competence mediated by the mentor?s impact on (a) the quality of the protege?s parental relationship and (b) the social capital of the allied classroom teacher; (2) To what degree does the quality of the student mentor?s relationships with faculty and peers mediate the impact of her serving as mentor on her self-efficacy, academic performance, and leadership skills?"

The program of studies will also include three cybersecurity-infused prerequisite courses involving computers, networking, and programming essentials. This effort will be conducted in partnership with the University of South Florida (USF). <br/><br/>The comprehensive project has several components. First, the project will create advanced curricular and training material for 100-level to 400-level courses enriched with a large number of virtual laboratories (vLabs) covering the fundamental principles of cybersecurity. The vLabs and training manuals will be portable, ready to use and deployable in a standard virtual environment without the need for configuration or package installation, thus promoting resource sharing. The proposed curriculum will also include a training standard recognized by the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) to meet the CNSS 4011 training standard. Second, NNMC and USF will establish an alliance with industry organizations and with Los Alamos National Laboratories (LANL), including Engineering/IT divisions at LANL and its National Security Education Center (NSEC), to create an internship program in cybersecurity. The alliance will strengthen the collaboration with industry and federal laboratories, in efforts to bolster national security. Third, NNMC will partner with the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions and a regional rural high-school to strengthen the cybersecurity pipeline and increase the production of professionals to fill regional demand. Finally, the educational model and curricular material will be available and further disseminated through well-established channels, such as the Western Academy Support and Training Center (WASTC). WASTC provides computer science and IT training across the country and supports hundreds of higher education institutions that have interest in adopting vLabs."

The College of Engineering and Technology is developing a research-generated knowledge base of how this student demographic best learns complex foundational Physical Science concepts by using the evidence-based Wright State model to create an introductory Physics course with project based activities that students will take prior to a theory-based Physics course. Students are being tracked to determine if this intervention leads to increases in learning, ability to apply concepts, and retention. Additionally, Native American and Hispanic students with high degrees of interdependent self-construal are being studied to determine if they respond better to active learning prior to theoretical learning. <br/><br/>The investigators will use a matched subjects samples methodology and a modification of the Solomon four-group research design. In addition, undergraduate research experiences are being studied to determine if they foster retention and greater clarity on future career pathways among these unique populations. The project expects to generate new scientific knowledge of effective interventions leading to retention in engineering among students from rural and tightly knit communities. For example, advances in understanding of how under-prepared populations best learn; contributions to education research regarding effective practices in engineering teaching and learning among understudied groups; and discoveries on successful strategies that can broaden participation of Native Americans, Hispanics and women in engineering programs. The proposed work is likely to produce a model that can be disseminated to other institutions facing similar challenges, or those that are focusing on diversifying engineering undergraduate population in their programs."

They have resided, uninterrupted, in the Espanola Valley for over 400 and 1000 years respectively. It is a place of great beauty, history and poverty. Its meager mineral beds were tapped out over 100 years ago and its high desert climate supports only small, largely subsistence, farms - irrigated by a communal acequia system that has been in continuous use for hundreds of years. There is evident pride in participating in the stewardship of a place that offers its fruits so grudgingly. The project intends to expand on this pride by engaging our undergraduates in the detailed mapping of the many layers of their environment, in the assimilation of these layers, and in the tactile simulation of natural and human-caused events (fire, flood, infestation, migration) within and across these layers. The complexity of these events and their cost in lives and livelihoods have lead many communities to invest in relevant technology. Given the low level of scientific and computational literacy in rural America this reliance on technology forces local environmental stakeholders to forfeit their agency to an outside technical expert. The intent of the project is to prepare undergraduates to assume this crucial role in their community. An expected outcome of the project is the resulting increase in pride, stemming from such place-based participation, will firmly set undergraduates on a pathway into the Geosciences.<br/><br/>The project's goals are focused on creating a platform for students that emphasizes modeling, learning and collaborative planning. The project seeks to equip undergraduates with systems thinking skills and have them serve as valued participants in environmental planning and flexible ambassadors of new technology en route to deeper learning in the Geosciences. The aims of the project's collaborative planning experience would (1) help non experts better understand complex human-natural interactions and to use that knowledge to (2) engage in more truly collaborative and creative planning activities. The former will give students the skills to pursue Geoscience while the latter will assure them that these hard won skills matter to the Earth and their community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

BEST will also support the entry of participants into the STEM workforce and graduate programs by providing paid summer workforce internships and URE.  This program is important for the advancement of scientific knowledge and understanding of those practices and services that most effectively recruit, retain and graduate underrepresented students in STEM, thereby increasing the number of underrepresented students entering the STEM workforce and diversifying the field.<br/><br/>The project objectives include: 1) increasing the number of students in Biology and ES programs by enhancing recruitment and retention; 2) increasing degree progress by increasing student credit hours taken per semester; 3) increasing graduation rates; and 4) implementing a longitudinal study that will generate a 'Risk of Leaving STEM' scale; analyze math anxiety among STEM and non-STEM majors; analyze student services that correlate with increases in a student's self-identity and sense of belonging in a STEM program; and analyze correlations between summer research/workforce internships and STEM career entry. The research will assess whether the support services and activities impact retention/graduation using a longitudinal cohort design. The measures employed are derived from the NSF Common Guidelines for Education Research and Development and involve qualitative and quantitative components.  Early attrition points are heavily targeted in the first four semesters to gain comparative samples and establish baselines. Tracking will occur at key points to collect additional measures to establish individual changes over time. Analyses will determine the effect of faculty and peer mentoring, summer internships, and engagement in professional activities as triggers for STEM leaving or enhanced STEM self-identification.  External evaluation will provide formative information to ensure continuous improvement of support services to ensure they foster retention and degree completion. Summative evaluation will gauge the project's effectiveness in meeting its goals and inform long range planning."
