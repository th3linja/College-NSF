More than half of the students entering Central New Mexico Community College place into developmental mathematics courses, which can set STEM majors back in their degree progression by up to two years.  The College Algebra/College Readiness Skills Course will be  designed to support student success in Algebra, enabling students to enter calculus, a required course for many STEM majors.  The College Algebra/College Readiness Skills Course will be designed by a professional learning community that includes high school and college mathematics faculty. The Course will be offered to high school seniors and to Central New Mexico Community College students, with the aim of enhancing student success in the transition to college-level mathematics course work. By participating in the professional learning community, college faculty will also gain insight about how to provide a better learning experience for first-year students. By better preparing students for success in college algebra courses, the project has the potential to support an increase in the number of students who successfully pursue STEM degrees.<br/><br/>The project seeks to enhance college readiness and completion of college algebra.  This goal will be accomplished through collaborative development of a contextualized College Algebra/College Readiness Skills Course by mathematics faculty at Central New Mexico Community College, Albuquerque High School, and South Valley Academy High School.  The faculty will identify how to improve students' mastery of mathematics and increase students' development of the skills needed to be successful in college STEM courses.  By building on the knowledge of high school and college mathematics teachers, the Course may better equip students for successful transfer into the community college, as well as provide a novel link between the collaborating institutions. The project will investigate the following research questions: (1) How does the Professional Learning Community affect teaching practices? (2) In what ways does curricular inclusion of college readiness and a contextualized approach to mathematics prepare students to succeed in subsequent college-level STEM courses? and (3) Does the College Algebra/College Readiness Course improve student success in first-year college STEM and mathematics courses?  To address these questions, the project will use quantitative and qualitative data, including student academic performance in mathematics and other STEM courses, and data from focus groups. The cross-institutional professional learning community infrastructure may be a replicable model for other institutions that seek to enhance the transition of students in the first year of college mathematics and other STEM courses. Project outcomes will be shared both regionally and nationally through conference presentations, and the curricula will be shared through an open-access, online platform. The Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address this need, a consortium of five New Mexico community colleges and the state's mathematics association of two-year colleges created the New Mexico Initiative for Math Reform. The project is designed to help improve student learning in introductory college mathematics and calculus through mathematics reform and technology.  Classroom intervention is being achieved by increasing and continuing the professional development of regional mathematics faculty member in the ways of mathematics reform and use of computer classrooms to implement reform.         The method of operation is the recursive application of sessions and workshops in which the participants, after acquiring and honing the techniques of mathematics reform, fan out across the region and host their own workshops. This iteration of workshops ensures an ""exponential delivery"" of the material. The region to be serviced is New Mexico and adjacent areas of its bordering states. The partners are the Albuquerque Technical Vocational Institute, New Mexico Military Institute, New Mexico State University at Alamogordo, New Mexico State University at Dona Ana, University of New Mexico at Valencia, San Juan Community College, and one professional organization, New Mexico Mathematical Association of Two Year Colleges. The impact is on the students of introductory college mathematics and calculus. The project has the potential of reaching every such student in the New Mexican region. The project is being evaluated with the aid of an outside investigator both formatively and summatively. The results of the project are being disseminated by the participants themselves through their own workshops, by presentations to professional organizations such as the American Association of  Two Year Colleges, and by publications in scholarly journals."

The Initiative will award scholarships to twenty low-income TVI students to complete two-year degrees and ten transfer scholarships to NM Tech. The Initiative provides financial support, enrichment activities, and peer tutors -- all proven retention and success strategies, particularly for minority students. Last year, 100% of TVI's graduates in computing and engineering technology were placed in employment or a four-year university. TVI, a Hispanic-Serving Institution, ranks nationally as a community college leader in graduating Hispanics; and, with 950 Native American students, it is larger than many Indian colleges. NM Tech, a state-supported research institution in science and engineering, has 1,400 students and is located 75 miles from Albuquerque. The CSE Students Ahead project will stimulate students to transfer to NM Tech for the high-quality research experience while retaining the intimacy of a small college and proximity to home and will place others in jobs. The project's two paths- associate and bachelor degree/employment and transfer-will move New Mexico's low-income students ahead.<br/>"

This expansion creates the  difficult challenge of upgrading course content and pedagogy, and providing adequate faculty  development opportunities among community colleges, the primary workforce providers, and  high school tech prep programs. The Albuquerque Technical Vocational Institute's (TVI) Project  TIE, Training for Industry Education, will address this problem by holding twelve, five-day  seminars in which up to 120 community college and high school faculty perform semiconductor  manufacturing processes in a clean room environment.             TVI's Regional Semiconductor Manufacturing Training Laboratory (RSMT Lab) is a  cleanroom that has been built to meet industry demands for well-trained semiconductor  manufacturing technicians. Seminars, planned by an administrative team of industry (Intel) and  educational (TVI) representatives, will be designed to provide hands-on work in TVI's RMST  Lab, dialogue about pedagogy, and discussions with semiconductor manufacturing engineers,  scientists, and technicians. Participants will receive a resource packet containing a technical  manual, bibliography, and information on developing SMT degree programs and laboratories.  The target audience is community college and Tech Prep high school faculty.             TVI's primary partner in this project is Intel Corporation, which has built Fab 11, its  largest plant, in Albuquerque. Sandia National Laboratories is a secondary partner. Project TIE  will provide faculty a rare opportunity to acquire hands-on experience in cleanroom environment.  Improved and enhanced instruction and communication among community colleges throughout  the US are anticiDated results as faculty take newly-acquired skills and resources to their schools."
