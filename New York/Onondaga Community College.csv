The project brings together Onondaga Community College, three area high schools, two additional New York community colleges, and local industries led by United Radio. The key component is a 1-semester integrated program. Its focus is a cluster of interdisciplinary, modular courses that include electronic skills, mathematical skills, composition skills and computing skills. Other components are Industry Internships, Teacher Training, and Career Awareness sessions. Internships will be the summer following completion of the program."

STEM Scholars Connect is providing up to 60 academically talented and economically disadvantaged STEM Scholars with financial support that allows them to pursue STEM education full-time and enrichment activities that are designed to increase their rates of completing associate degrees in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:  The STEM Scholars Connect project is addressing the national imperative to recruit and retain undergraduates in STEM disciplines.  This is accomplished by implementing best practices, such as peer mentoring and cohort-building activities, providing opportunities to engage in research, offering scholastic support services that include a first-year STEMinar and interacting with industry professionals to explore STEM career pathways.  The STEM Scholars Connect project provides a model for other community colleges to adapt and implement to increase graduation rates of students pursuing STEM majors.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: By encouraging the participation of underrepresented groups, displaced workers, refugees and financially disadvantaged students, the STEM Scholars Connect project increases access to educational and professional opportunities for diverse students, thereby diversifying the STEM workforce.  Dissemination of lessons learned from this project will inform better strategies for broadening the participation of underserved and underprivileged students in STEM disciplines."

This project combines NSF scholarships with the New York State-Funded Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program (CSTEP) to improve student enrollment and success. CSTEP provides extensive recruiting and academic support services for underrepresented and economically disadvantaged students in mathematics, science, and technology fields. Forming a distinct cohort, CSTEP students participate in many academic support, experiential learning and career exploration services together. Despite support structures available through CSTEP, student success is compromised by job and family responsibilities. Most CSTEP students have significant financial need remaining after financial aid, and must take loans and work part-time to make ends meet. Program objectives are to increase awareness about STEM programs and CSTEP, increase enrollment of economically disadvantaged and under-represented students in STEM disciplines and in CSTEP, and improve retention and graduation rates of CSTEP students in STEM programs. <br/> <br/>Intellectual Merit: The Collegiate Science and Technology Program has demonstrated success in supporting students in STEM programs through advising, career exploration, and academic program enhancements.  This activity advances understanding of effective recruiting and support initiatives for STEM programs by combining two support programs, CSTEP and NSF S-STEM, to strengthen the success and impact of each. <br/> <br/>Broader Impact: This activity helps define the degree to which financial assistance improves STEM program enrollment and student performance among financially needy students and helps the college develop long-term strategies to improve overall enrollment and performance in STEM disciplines.  Results are being disseminated to other institutions with CSTEPs, to community colleges, and to partner four-year institutions with similar support programs.  <br/><br/>"

Innovations in UAV technology have increased the types and volume of data that can be collected for use by industries such as agriculture, law enforcement, environmental monitoring and remediation, and utilities.  However, to inform these industries, the collected data must be analyzed and interpreted. Recent investments by New York State and private industry in Central New York have increased the demand for UAV-related research, development, and innovation. It has also increased the demand for technicians skilled in UAV data analysis and interpretation. This project will develop new stackable credentials, including a micro-credential and certificate, that will be embedded within an associate of applied science degree in Geospatial Science and Technology.  These credentials will be designed to meet the needs of traditional students, adult learners, and industry. The project will also develop applied learning, outreach, and engagement activities to broaden participation in the program, including participation of women and economically disadvantaged individuals.  In this way, the project has the potential to increase the number and diversity of individuals entering the UAV/geospatial technology workforce, where they can have stable careers with compensation that is higher than the living wage level. <br/><br/>This project aims to meet industry needs for a technical workforce with competencies in analyzing and applying geospatial and UAV-collected data, as well as to broaden participation in the field. The project will develop a new UAV-data analytics curriculum that includes a 24-credit certificate program and a three-course micro-credential, both of which will be embedded within a Geospatial Science and Technology (GST) associate of applied science degree program. The GST degree program includes courses in geographic information systems, remote sensing, cartography, and quantitative analysis that will be bolstered by and complement the new UAV curriculum. The project will conduct a Developing a Curriculum (DACUM) analysis and use the results to develop the stackable credentials. The DACUM results will be shared with the National Geospatial Technology Center of Excellence and made available as an open resource to other academic institutions. The project will also develop new data sets and UAV-data analytics lab exercises to collect raw data using a UAV equipped with a variety of sensors.  The varied data will be used to introduce students to the broad range of problems they will analyze in different industry sectors, such as using UAV technology to determine the extent of apple tree fungus or to inspect utility lines.  The project will recruit new students into GST and UAV-data analytics by developing informational materials, conducting outreach to incumbent workers through employer partners, and expanding the college?s partnership with a local 9-12 high school in Syracuse, New York, that has 83% of its students qualifying for free lunch and is classified as ?economically disadvantaged? by the New York State Department of Education. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation?s economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
