Because industry partners in the region are research-driven firms that depend on highly-skilled technicians to remain competitive, Westchester Community College (WCC), a Minority and Hispanic Serving Institution in Valhalla, New York, has designed the Photonics and Laser Project (PAL-TEC) in response to increased regional demand for skilled technicians. Area employers anticipate a 35% increase in the number of technicians needed with knowledge and skills in photonics and optics and have made long-term commitments to the program. PAL-TEC will increase the number and quality of technicians by developing (1) a new educational pathway aligned with industry standards, (2) new teaching methods; and (3) an evidence-based, gender-inclusive recruitment and retention program. It has strong support from area industry partners that include IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bern Optics and Kent Optronics. PAL-TEC is a scalable model designed with evidence-based best practices from the NSF ATE community that can easily be adopted by other two-year colleges. The project will involve course development; professional development of faculty; development of gender-inclusive recruitment and retention plans and activities; and dissemination at national conferences and meetings of high school and college faculty and counselors. This project will establish a regional pathway to photonics careers and address the recruitment and retention of women and minorities, a long-standing challenge for the field of mechanical technology, and a growing demand for highly-skilled photonics technicians. It has the potential to significantly impact traditional enrollment patterns in mechanical technology programs at the college by introducing a new paradigm for increasing participation among women and minorities by focusing on the nature of these careers today. This project represents a strong partnership between industry, academia and high schools, addresses an unmet need in the Northeast region, and contributes to understanding how NSF ATE technical education resources can be readily adapted to meet emerging industry needs. A comprehensive evaluation will determine project effectiveness and impact. <br/><br/>This project will improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and educator development by improving curriculum, teaching methods, and faculty capacity in optics and photonics. The technologies to be taught are in use in manufacturing, data transmission, medical testing, and imaging industries. PAL-TEC will convene industry, high school, four-year, and internal partners in order to assess, design, and implement timely modifications to existing programs and to improve the diversity of the STEM technician labor force. Professional development in photonics, problem-based learning, and gender-inclusive strategies will be utilized. It will leverage expertise from the Asheville Buncombe Technical Community College (AB-Tech) ATE project, the National Center for Optics and Photonics (OP-TEC), other model institutions, and expert resources to scale quickly and effectively.  WCC will work to expand use of NSF ATE resources to improve its technician education programs and share best practices with others to meet changing regional needs. NSF resources to be used include OP- TEC, A-B Tech, South Carolina ATE Center of Excellence, ATE Central, ATE-TV, and TeachingTechnicians.org."

The more students who enter these fields, themore apt is the country likely to regain its economic leadership.The college will provide an early exposure to mathematical modeling--the first time at acommunity college--in order to make mathematics more interesting, exciting, and relevant.A manual on mathematical modeling will be developed, refined, and disseminated widely. It will be used as the basis for establishing an elective course in mathematical modelingat WCC. It will also be used to coach teams of students who will participate in the annualmathematical modeling competition.A national conference will be conducted to provide wide exposure to mathematicalmodeling at community colleges. The Principal Investigator will assist other colleges toinitiate course in mathematical modeling and to establish student teams for entry into thecompetitions."

Recent developments by commercial companies have provided functional units of modern physics equipment for undergraduate instructional purposes. These units are multi-purpose in design so several correlated, but distinct principles of contemporary physics may be experimentally investigated. The major functional units to be purchased will supplement modern physics instrumentation presently on hand in the department. Experiments will be organized around the physics of the electron, and will include: 1. Physics of Electron System: (The systematic study of the electron: ""e/m"", the Hertz critical potentials: ""e"" energy levels, electron diffraction: dual nature of electron, Planck's ""Quantum of Action"" principle.) 2. Electron-Spin Resonance System: (Magnetic moment of electron due to its spin; electron resonance; Lande' factor.) The intent is to provide pre-engineering students with an education comparable to that received by students in engineering schools they transfer to. The college will match the award with an equal amount of funds."
