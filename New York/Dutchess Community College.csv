A faculty team will develop a single, unified course integrating elements from what are currently separate courses in introductory mathematics, chemistry, physics, English and reading. Modern manufacturing will be used as the integrating theme. The project will significantly change the undergraduate learning experience through the employment of new curricula, innovative laboratories, new delivery systems, and fresh instructional materials. It is hoped that the project will be a blueprint for the development of an industrial technology certificate granting program which could be replicated by other institutions of higher education, particularly technical colleges."

The scholarships provide financial support to full-time students who have demonstrated need and are enrolled in or plan to enroll in our mathematics, computer science, engineering science and engineering technology programs. Both part-time and non-traditional students are being encouraged to apply for MACSER scholarships. Offering financial support to those students whose current economic situation prevents them from attending college on a full-time basis provides a mechanism that enables the student to shorten the amount of time required to complete his or her respective program. It also leads to an increase in the number of full time students enrolled in the mathematics, computer science, engineering science and engineering technology programs.  By providing scholarship opportunities, the project is relieving some of the burden full-time employment places on them, and helping to ensure academic success. Extra efforts are being spent on increasing the number of women and underrepresented minorities in the targeted majors as well.<br/><br/>The program provides a support network for scholarship recipients, which builds community and is the cornerstone and strength of the MACSER Scholars program. This network includes personal advising, academic support, mentoring, peer tutoring, a virtual community, and MACSER workshops. These serve to increase the academic success of students enrolled in the MACSER Scholars majors."

The sequence is covering the material normally developed during the first three semesters of the standard analytical calculus sequence and the standard engineering physics sequence taken by freshmen and sophomores. The core of the project is the creation of a series of mini- labs which develop analytical topics in tandem with physical principles using data-gathering equipment connected to personal computers. The investigators are considering the long-standing pair of problems in introductory science education: applications meant to motivate the calculus are often developed poorly and/or out of context by the calculus instructor, and mathematical tools needed in the physics course are often used by the physics instructor before they have been adequately developed in the calculus course."

The laboratory is to be located in a specially configured room using the standard model of a science exploratorium and incorporating into it a strong mathematics component. This exploratorium permits the offering of some paired sections of physics and calculus where the emphasis is on the study of physical phenomena. The facility provides faculty the tools to present models and have students participate in making modifications thereto. When used as an open lab, it gives students an area in close proximity to mentors and the necessary equipment for their work on independent projects and assignments. The configuration of the room enables an instructor to see all displays from the front and provides each student with individual computer space and work space. Further, the exploratorium provides a place in which to demonstrate the on-going curriculum changes to full time department members and to the numerous adjunct faculty."
