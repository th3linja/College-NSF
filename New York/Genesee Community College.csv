Mead Connection to NSFNET Proposal No. NCR-9417327 The Genesee Community College (SUNY) requests support from NSF for connection of their campus networks to SUNYnet which is in turn the gateway to the NSFNET. SUNYnet will provide operations management and information services and it will give Genesee Community College a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore innovative educational resources."

Technology Opportunity Pathway (TOP) provides 30 scholars who demonstrate academic skills and personal readiness with scholarships. <br/> <br/>Intellectual Merit: The scholarship program objectives are to (1) increase the number of students, including those from underrepresented groups, as a result of targeted recruitment and scholarship aid; 2) improve student persistence and GPA with orientation, mentoring, tracking, and support services; and 3) provide assistance for students to transfer to a four-year institution or to seek employment in a technical field. The TOP Team consists of five faculty members and the Dean of Enrollment Management. Recruitment materials and support service activities are being developed to promote the program to traditional and adult learners. TOP scholars are selected based on financial need, academic merit, professional readiness, and personal information. The TOP team is developing and maintaining relationships with local businesses to promote internships and career and transfer opportunities. A significant component is the required participation in college and TOP student services activities.  Meetings and workshops feature guest speakers and skills to provide scholars with useful information, training, and survival strategies aimed at educating a highly skilled technical workforce. These meetings help form a community of faculty and peers and promote lifetime learning skills and professionalism. <br/><br/>Broader Impact:  The program outcomes are being compiled at the end of each semester and summary data is being reported on a TOP Scholar page linked to the college website.  Presentations are being made at statewide and national conferences.  The principal investigators are collaborating with other CSEMS projects and sharing program outcomes with colleagues through publications and at professional conferences.<br/>"

The materials being developed address the student needs of learning a new language that includes the use of symbols, learning to think more abstractly and make associations between concepts, and learning how to read a scientific textbook  to  build on prior knowledge, read and interpret charts and graphs, and  make sense of static drawings of active processes. These materials are increasing the retention and graduation rates and better preparing students for certification testing and/or transfer to a four-year institution. The project also focuses on instruction for faculty on how to best use these materials in the classroom. <br/><br/>Underrepresented students, students from rural areas, and women are gaining the science literacy skills necessary to successfully complete the first two years of the science curriculum and either transfer to a four-year institution or pass certification exams for career pathways."
