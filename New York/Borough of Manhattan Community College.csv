It does not offer degrees beyond the baccalaureate level. The project entitled ""Broadening STEM Participation Among Minority Students in an Urban Community College"" will support quality education, mentoring and internship opportunities for an ethnically diverse population. This initiative builds on the undergraduate research experience for students developed and implemented by the University of Maryland-Baltimore County (UMBC) Meyerhoff program. This model of undergraduate research remains a novel concept for most community colleges. New knowledge will be added by BMCC research efforts, which will seek to determine the support programs that work to fully engage students and ensure that S-STEM interventions positively impact retention and graduation. As an alternative to research students will also be provided the opportunity to participate in off campus internships. Assignments will be developed by S-STEM faculty with input from the college's private industry partners. Students will work much like members of industry based teams, dealing with problems in areas of basic research, product development and testing, analytical technologies, risk assessment and regulatory compliance. Each intern will be supervised by company personnel and visited at the worksite by BMCC Cooperative Education Internship Coordinators. Sixty talented full-time students in Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineering and/or Science are expected to be recruited into the program and awarded a 2-year scholarship. <br/><br/>Research indicates that an undergraduate research experience as a capstone experience undertaken by students during their final year of study is successful. The Meyerhoff program success is built upon the concept that by assembling a concentration of high achieving students in a tightly knit learning community, students continually inspire one another to do more and better. That program boasts a STEM retention rate of 86% which is twice the national average for all students and more than four times the average for African American students.  BMCC has already in place programs and initiatives to support students success. The project will examine closely how the use of a structured STEM pathway model involving the use of the learning communities, in tandem with the Winter Bridge program, and faculty mentored research can achieve the same outcomes as those commonly found at residential four-year colleges such as UMBC, and whether these reforms can be sustained and replicated. Ongoing data collection, abstraction, and analysis will allow the research team to examine in specific and measurable ways the extent to which S-STEM participants are effectively being served and the success of program activities on improved academic outcomes (e.g., achievement, retention, graduation, post-secondary school enrollment). Collected data will be used to demonstrate if this model is useful when applied in early stages (critical and decisive years) of STEM careers. The results of this project will have a profound effect in determining whether similar reforms can be adapted by a urban community colleges serving populations traditionally underrepresented in the STEM disciplines."

Student research focuses on bioactivity of natural products at different biological levels of organization (e.g., the potential antioxidant capacity of natural plant products used in different cultural groups, the effects of natural extracts on microorganisms in fresh water and marine environments with changing salinity, in regulating genes involved in differentiation of cells, and in potential protective effects on growth of mammalian cells).  Students will receive training in all aspects of the scientific method including biostatistics, and workshops in professional development including scientific communication (oral presentations, scientific writing), lab safety, ethics/responsible conduct of research and STEM careers. Field trips to  internationally recognized botanical gardens,  an agricultural experiment station and an herb farm will introduce students to sources of many natural extracts, with emphasis on research in plant sciences and networking opportunities. The program culminates with each student preparing a research paper and giving an oral presentation on their individual research.<br/>   It is anticipated that a total of 24 students primarily from underrepresented groups from community colleges with limited research opportunities will be trained in the program. Students will learn how to conduct research, develop professional skills, and may present their work at scientific conferences. With community colleges accounting for more than half of all undergraduate enrollments, the BMCC REU program may serve as a national model for other two-year institutions involved in STEM research which seek to encourage and facilitate transfer of STEM majors to four-year institutions.<br/>  A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program.

Business, industry, and government need well-prepared technicians who can prevent, detect, and investigate cybersecurity breaches, and the growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have appropriate, specific knowledge and skills. Borough of Manhattan Community College's Computer Information Systems Department offers programs in Computer Information Systems (CIS) and Computer Network Technology (CNT) leading to an Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degree. These programs enroll hundreds of majors, over two thirds of whom are Black or Hispanic. In this project, faculty will create a concentration in cybersecurity in each of the two AAS degree programs. Six new courses will be developed or adapted from models at other institutions, and nine existing courses will be revised. The project team will recruit high school students into the new cybersecurity concentrations, prepare students for employment by offering internships and support for industry certification exams, and assist students who wish to transfer into related four-year degree programs. The project will play a significant role in preparing students for cybersecurity positions and in expanding opportunities for underrepresented minorities in the field.<br/><br/>The project team will work with representatives from the New York City College of Technology, Manhattan Bridges High School, the Center for Systems Security and Information Assurance (CSSIA), and the National CyberWatch Center to adapt and implement exemplary educational materials and pedagogical strategies aimed at increasing the number of students who pursue studies in cybersecurity and information assurance. The curriculum will integrate new and emerging technologies such as mobile computing, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). To support the new curriculum, the project team will launch a comprehensive faculty development program, cybersecurity workshops for high school students, a pre-freshman summer bridge program, supplemental instruction and tutoring, test preparation workshops targeting industry cybersecurity certifications, cybersecurity internships for students, expanded articulation agreements with the NYC College of Technology, and a state-of-the-art cybersecurity lab utilizing virtualization technology. The project evaluation will look at students' achievement of learning goals, skills, and industry certifications; retention and graduation rates; educational pursuits and advancement beyond the associate degree; participation in internships; and placement as technicians in technology companies."

In addition, the project is offering an eight-week summer instructional program (a ""bridge"" program) for high school students; arranging internships for students in conjunction with industry partners; developing a cybersecurity laboratory; and providing professional development for college and high school faculty through in-person and online workshops and training sessions.<br/><br/>The project team is creating four courses and redesigning seventeen other courses in order to integrate computer security concepts into each major (Computer Operations, Computer Programming, and Computer Science) in the college's CIS curriculum.  The computer security concepts included in these courses are derived from objectives specified by CompTIA's Security+ certification and the Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) specified by the International Information Systems Security Certifications Consortium [(ISC)2] for the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) and System Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP) certifications.  The concepts covered in the courses are also tied to job competencies defined in the computer security skill standards that have been developed by the National Workforce Center for Emerging Technologies (NWCET).  In addition to redesigning the curricula for CIS majors, the project team is redesigning a non-major CIS course to raise the cybersecurity awareness of students in non-technical majors.<br/><br/>By infusing cybersecurity concepts throughout the subject matter of existing curricula, this project takes a different approach than traditional security instruction, which presupposes a certain body of knowledge prior to introducing security concepts to students.  This different approach extends the impact of this project by enabling students with diverse academic backgrounds to engage in different activities within the context of computer security.  At one end of the spectrum, it encourages computer science majors to do research on the underlying theories of security, while at the other end, it raises awareness and teaches secure computing practices to non-CIS majors.  The project also includes high school students recruited through a summer ""bridge"" program, and enables graduates to continue their education through articulation agreements with four-year colleges.<br/><br/>The project is also attracting minorities and women into information technology careers.  Over 75% of BMCC's students are African American or Hispanic, and over two thirds of BMCC's students are women.  The college has developed a ""collaborative learning model"" that has proven particularly effective in engaging and retaining female and minority students in science, technology, and mathematics fields.<br/><br/>BMCC's partners in the project include Louis D.

Although it is often assumed that STEM majors start with calculus as their first college math course, this is not the case for many urban and minority community college students. This project is addressing the national problem of mathematics remediation for STEM majors by creating a game- and simulation-based algebra and trigonometry curriculum. The curriculum features three to five video games that place math content within real-world GIS scenarios.  The curriculum is used in a summer immersion program for in-coming Geographic Information Science (GIS) majors at the Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC). The project will impact STEM education at a national level by providing all materials free and open-source to secondary and post-secondary institutions via a project website with downloadable curricula, game software, video tutorials, professional development materials for faculty and staff, and support forums. The summer immersion program pairs MAT 056, the most common remedial math course for BMCC STEM majors, with GEO 100, the first course in the GIS sequence.  Students in the program are recruited from NYC high school graduates participating in BMCC's Science Technology Entry Program. After completing the summer program, students will receive special support services and internships in GIS to advance them into an articulating baccalaureate program at CUNY or in related industries. This project targets BMCC's large population of minority students (over 90%) and women students (nearly 60%). <br/><br/>Evidence-based research has shown gaming in the mathematics curriculum has the power to transform mathematics education from an intimidating and negative experience to one that is fun, engaging, and successful.  While there are many promising NSF-funded science games that are engaging and promote deep learning, there are very few math games that do so, and even fewer that specifically cover algebra topics in a way that can be appreciated by adult learners.  Success in basic algebra is a major stumbling block for students seeking technical careers.  This project will build on: 1) a previous NSF grant award to develop a GIS major at BMCC and 2) a Department of Education Title V grant for Hispanic-serving institutions to enhance e-learning initiatives at BMCC, including game-based learning.  Games and simulations will feature real-world applications that focus on skills and contexts necessary for a career in GIS. Results of this project will be disseminated through conference presentations and publications. Project outcomes will be assessed through in-game analytics, traditional quizzes and midterm exams, and the common department final exam for MAT 056. Department final exam scores and course retention rates will be compared with rates for the college as a whole, using a logistic regression analysis of statistically matched cohorts. In addition, differences by gender and ethnicity will be examined. Student opinion surveys and focus groups will further gauge the effectiveness of the games and simulations on student attitudes toward math and technical fields. Finally, the program will be examined using longitudinal data on student enrollment, two-year retention rates, and progress toward degree or transfer."

College algebra has consistently been identified as a barrier to student degree progress and completion, particularly for groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.  One part of the barrier to student progress is the lack of validated assessments to measure understanding of algebra concepts. The project will undertake this important work by building a pool of items to assess conceptual understanding and then testing and validating the database at seven different colleges and universities. <br/><br/>The aim of this project is to generate a calibrated item pool of 200 validated questions that assess conceptual understanding in college algebra. This calibrated item pool can then be used by: 1) researchers to assess the effectiveness of curricula and teaching approaches in improving algebraic conceptual understanding; and 2) practitioners to generate diagnostic tests, the results of which could then be used to target instruction to address specific student misconceptions. This research will create the first validated calibrated item pool to test elementary algebra conceptual understanding in the college context.  The research builds on initial successful work developing and validating a 22-question elementary algebra concept inventory. A calibrated item pool also will allow for multiple versions of the test to be equated, so instructors or researchers can give different students different test forms but equate the scores, thus improving exam security and the reliability of results.  The concept inventory database will be validated with students from the City College of New York system, where the student population is roughly 80% non-white, 60% female, 60% Pell-grant recipients, 50% first-generation college students, and 40% for whom English was not their first language. The instrument will also be tested at six other colleges across the country to ensure generalization to different institutional contexts. The project will also produce a conceptual framework for college students' understanding of elementary algebra.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The STEM education pipeline narrows significantly in college. Community colleges serve some of the most diverse audiences, and are increasingly using online learning as a cheaper way to provide STEM instruction; additionally Massive Open Online Courses (commonly known as MOOCs) are being proposed as alternatives to credit-bearing instruction. Prior research shows that online learning environments impact different kinds of students differently. This research project based at a community college asks questions such as the following: Is this move towards STEM learning online at the community college level likely to impact underrepresented groups more than others, and will it have positive or negative impact? Can we identify which students are best served by online vs. face-to-face instruction or conduct interventions for students 'at-risk' in the online environment? This project aims to answer these questions by using two important datasets: one is a dataset to be assembled from six schools in the CUNY (City University of New York) system, which serves one of the most diverse student bodies in the country, and in which over 50,000 students have taken STEM courses online. The second is a large-scale national dataset from the National Center for Education Statistics which contains demographic, academic, personal, and financial variables.<br/><br/>Only a small proportion of the research conducted on online learning has controlled for student self-selection into online courses in a rigorous way. This study will explore the extent to which students with particular characteristics fare better or more poorly not only in online STEM courses, but in college afterwards, with a matched comparison to students who take comparable face-to-face STEM courses. The project uses mixed methods. Quantitative analysis will include principal component factor analysis, logistic regression, linear regression, analysis of variance and covariance, generalized linear mixed models, propensity score matching, and sensitivity analysis to examine course and college outcomes including course retention (attendance through the end of the tenth week of classes) and successful course completion (earning a C- or better in the course), whether students re-enrolled in the semester immediately following the course, and persistence at one, two, three, and six years. Overall grade point average, the number of credits accumulated, and transfer and graduation rates at these intervals will also be used. Independent variables and covariates to be modeled include online vs. hybrid vs. offline STEM course format, and a variety of demographic variables including effort capital, social capital, cultural capital, financial capital, human capital, and habitus. Qualitative interviews and in-depth surveys will be used to explore the trends found in the large scale datasets, and a survey will be conducted specifically with online instructors in the CUNY system. Data will be explored to model what variables contribute to differential 'risk' online. The intellectual merit of the project rests on advancing our understanding of how online options differentially help or hinder different kinds of postsecondary STEM students. For broader impacts, the results of the model could be used as the basis for implementation of targeted interventions, either by providing at-risk students with additional mentoring, tutoring, technical support, advisement, or training in skills and behaviors necessary to succeed in an online course; or by advising them to enroll in a comparable face-to-face course instead. These policy implications will be discussed at a culminating one-day conference on elearning hosted by the project."

This was accomplished by adding computer-based collaborative workshops, based on the Treismann model, to Calculus I, II, and III. It has become increasingly clear that to recruit and retain women and minorities the program must begin at an earlier level; so they are pushing their successful efforts back to the precalculus level.

Annually, between 28% and 36% of all post-secondary students in the U.S. enroll in at least one online course.  The growth in online course enrollment contrasts with an overall decline in college enrollment.  Thus, continued online course growth will have an escalating impact on degree progression and attainment.  Online course-taking is widely adopted at community colleges, which have large populations of first-generation college students, low-income students, female students, students of color and non-traditional students.  As a result, online courses at community colleges may have disproportionate impacts on the degree completion of students from groups that have been underrepresented in STEM fields. To support an innovative and productive national STEM workforce, access to STEM careers must be available to the entire, diverse U.S. talent pool. The aim of this research is to explore whether limited access to online courses hinders degree progress for STEM majors, particularly those from underrepresented groups.<br/> <br/>The assumption that online courses enable non-traditional students with work and family responsibilities to enroll in more courses has never been rigorously tested.  This project will: 1) explore the relationship between online course availability and academic momentum (the number of credits in which a student enrolls) and STEM persistence, with a particular focus on ""non-traditional"" students; 2) explore the role of student time poverty (i.e. quantity and quality of time available for college) in mediating these patterns; and 3) explore scarcity of alternate course sections as a potential moderating variable in explaining these patterns. No large-scale studies to date have explored whether the availability of online courses increases access to, or momentum through, college or STEM degrees.  This project will collect data on 22,000 City University of New York (CUNY) students and will make causal inferences by using: 1) a simulated course registration system to create a within-subjects experimental design; and 2) student placement on course waitlists to conduct a regression discontinuity design.  CUNY's student population mirrors the groups traditionally under-represented in STEM: largely non-white, female, and low income, as well as a large proportion who are non-native English speakers and first-generation college students.  This project is designed to provide critical information to practitioners and policymakers about how to balance the dual concerns of access and retention when offering online courses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All galaxies appear to be surrounded by large halos of dark matter.  And dark matter dominates the gravitational field of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Dark matter is dark because it does not emit or absorb light making it hard to study.  In fact, astronomers do not yet know the true nature of dark matter.  But understanding this will advance our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics.<br/><br/>By studying the dark matter halos of galaxies, and how their gravity bends light from more distant sources (gravity lenses), astronomers can learn about the structure of the dark matter in the halos how they were formed.  Various models to explain these things have been developed, and they can all be tested based on what actually happens in dark matter halos.  This proposed study will use high-resolution images of gravity lenses to learn more about the structure of the dark-matter halos.  The results will also help determine the type of particle dark matter is.<br/><br/>The PI's institution serves students from underrepresented and/or underprivileged backgrounds.  The Broader Impact part of this project will be to award promising undergraduate science and engineering majors (a minimum of six students over three years) a stipend to do research (allowing them to focus on studies and research rather than work part time jobs outside of school). The undergraduates will learn skills, and gain experiences, that are vital to STEM fields, while also producing valuable results for this project.  Each year, students accepted to the program will work at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) during the summer.  They will participate in a three-day workshop to acquire scientific computing skills, attend weekly meetings to discuss recent papers in astrophysics, and at the end of the summer will give a talk on their research at the AMNH ""Physical Sciences REU Symposium"". Finally, after the following fall semester the students will have the opportunity to attend and give a poster presentation of their research at the winter American Astronomical Society (AAS) meeting.<br/><br/>This project clearly relates to NSF's mission to promote the progress of science.  In addition, the ""Broader Impact"" portion of the project does this, and advances the national health, prosperity and welfare by helping to develop interest in, and educating, STEM activities among the next generation of diverse individuals.<br/><br/><br/>The existence of small dark matter substructure in galaxies is a key prediction of dark matter theories that remains largely untested.  The project's goals are to test the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm by analyzing a sample of gravitational lenses observed at high resolution. The proposed project will evaluate methods to detect and characterize substructure in gravitational lens galaxies.  In particular it will consist of observing lenses in the submillimeter electromagnetic spectral range.  Galaxies with gravitational lenses are being discovered rapidly in this area.  Using high-resolution observations (e.g. by the ALMA telescope array) of these galaxies, the PI and team will obtain unprecedented information on the dark matter distribution in galaxies. And because gravitational lensing directly exhibits the warping of space time by dark matter, a study of gravitational lens systems is a promising method to constrain generic particle properties of dark matter (independent of specific particle models). The team's primary goal is to show how this information can be used to constrain the detailed properties of dark matter substructure as a way of identifying the nature of dark matter itself."
