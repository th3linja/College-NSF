An integrated three-course sequence at Kingsborough Community College features an education course with a fieldwork component, an independent study course, and a revised Biology course. These courses are engaging preservice teachers in inquiry-based science projects with a constructivist approach. The students participate in field work at informal science institutions and serve as docents working with children under the supervision of a science educator. Kingsborough Community College and Brooklyn College faculty are collaborating in the development of web-enhanced courses and virtual components of science and education courses. An on-line advisement system for transfer students is specifically designed to facilitate the transition of prospective teachers into the teacher preparation program Brooklyn College. The project includes early mentoring by peer tutors and K-12 teachers. The overall goal of ""Crossing Boundaries"" is to expand the pool of qualified teachers and to better prepare these teachers to introduce their own students to science and mathematics. <br/><br/>"

Virtual Enterprise education is a business and entrepreneurship simulation in which students create and operate virtual firms and trade virtual or real products and services through e-commerce in a global network of 4,000 firms in 40 countries. It provides students with a bridge between school and career by immersing them in a realistic, but safe, technology and business environment. The project builds on several years of experience at Kingsborough based on the European model of the Practice Firm; but Virtual Enterprise lacks the technological backbone to incorporate higher-level information technology skills. The planning grant is to assess needs; to develop, and modify Virtual Enterprise scenarios for technical courses of study; to evaluate that the Virtual Enterprise Course meets student, faculty program and industry needs; and to gain support and adoption in other technical programs at Kingsborough and other CUNY colleges."

CUNY Kingsborough Community College, which serves a largely low income and highly diverse population of students, proposes to develop, implement, and evaluate a comprehensive set of proven approaches that target the major barriers of unpreparedness, lack of support networks, financial burdens, and inability to connect STEM education with daily life for students in their beginning biology courses.  Improving student success in these early biology courses will lead to improvements in retention and increase the number of STEM students graduating and transferring to 4-year institutions.<br/><br/>Three types of activities are proposed for students selected to participate in this program.  First, a Strategies for Success in STEM workshop will be offered prior to General Biology I to strengthen basic reading, math, and study skills.  Second, a community of biology learners will be established for students to collaboratively review biological principles, build camaraderie, and interact with faculty outside of the classroom setting.  Third, a campus as a research lab approach that leverages the existing campus aquarium, farm, beach, and marine technology facilities will provide relevant research experiences and one-on-one faculty mentoring.  Support will also be provided for faculty to develop and implement new pedagogies, receive training in assessment of classroom activities, and participate in opportunities to communicate their work both on campus and with the larger community.  The goals are to improve student performance and retention; foster greater understandings of nature, science, and citizenship; and enhance the capacities of the faculty to engage students.  <br/><br/>Each of these activities will be carefully evaluated through student interviews, concept inventories, assignments in community of biology learner meetings that explore misconceptions about biological concepts, and reflection papers about their campus as a research lab experiences.  Evaluation of faculty activities will include interviews, surveys, focus groups, publications, presentations, and tracking of faculty involved in the project.  Progress will be measured by the degree to which the project met its benchmarks.  The mixed methods evaluation will provide valuable information, models, and materials that other community colleges can use as they struggle to improve STEM learning, retention, and transfer for low-income and underrepresented minority students."

The Institute for Virtual Enterprise proposes to plan for a Center for Technological Entrepreneurship that provides the means to infuse entrepreneurship in technical courses.  The Center develops, maintains and disseminates modular curricular materials based on successful practices at community colleges such as problem- and scenario- based learning and including those developed and tested in the Virtual Enterprise Institute.  Students using these materials, particularly those from populations underrepresented in STEM technician fields and students from rural areas, are networked through a series of virtual activities.  The modular materials are disseminated through a network of faculty demonstration sites mentored by the Center.  The planning process includes two workshops with advisory partners from industry and academia that are to determine the state of entrepreneurial STEM education at community colleges and to investigate the need for and design of entrepreneurship student networks.  The planning process also produces a catalog of the skills required by STEM entrepreneurs and validates the approach of developing modular materials to infuse these skills into existing STEM courses through the development of faculty demonstration sites."

Based on previous work in building a virtual technology firm that fills a societal or business need through innovative services or products it created, this project develops, implements, and evaluates two courses for an information technology curriculum -a capstone course and an awareness course.  With the Virtual Enterprise system, technicians learn the technical content with activities that also require the use of entrepreneurial and ""essential"" skills sought after by industry.  Past experience has shown that minority students can become engaged in the use of technology and learn concepts and skills in an awareness course.  The capstone course also emphasizes the essential workplace competencies prized by industry.  A capstone virtual enterprise course in biotechnology is developed in collaboration with faculty in the biotechnology department.  Faculty in information technology and biotechnology at other two year colleges are provided direct training in the Virtual Enterprise system and personnel from three ATE centers in other disciplines are provided professional development in the use of the Virtual Enterprise system so that they can train other faculty from two year colleges to use it.  Course syllabi, professional development materials are developed evaluated and disseminated."
