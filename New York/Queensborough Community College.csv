By adapting and implementing Queens College's (QC/CUNY) exemplary TIME2000 program (NSF DUE 9652972), the pipeline of prospective mathematics teachers at the middle and high school levels is being increased. TIMEQCC is establishing a mathematics-education program at Queensborough Community College (QCC) and increasing the junior year cohort in TIME2000. The success of TIME2000 has been demonstrated through increased retention rates, media recognition, and additional funding from the college and a private foundation. The goal of increasing the pipeline of qualified teachers is being accomplished by targeting the under-recruited population of QCC students who have completed college algebra or precalculus with a B or better and then retaining them using two major innovations. These innovations are:<br/> 1. Cross-campus counseling and teaching (QCC and QC), including an interdisciplinary mathematics education course.<br/> 2. Implementing the successful QCC upper level mathematics retention model -- tutoring in upper level mathematics courses, study groups based on the Uri Treisman model, and tutoring internships in the Mathematics Learning Center.<br/><br/>Working closely with the TIME2000 faculty at QC, the structure of the program is being adapted for the community college student. Formative and summative evaluations are being conducted using QC's established evaluation procedures. Dissemination is through the CUNY Council of Math Chairs and national on-line conferences."

Courses are being modified so that the material is appropriately tailored for our students. They are being redesigned to be accessible, yet challenging, for the 2-year college student. The project is modifying foundation courses in psychology, economics, and sociology. The courses selected are part of our core requirements for most students including those in our teacher preparation program. In psychology, we are adapting and incorporating observational procedures developed in an NSF-funded psychology project at Macalester College. Also, basic concepts crucial to understanding simple statistical constructs that are central to research methods are being incorporated with modifications from an NSF-supported project carried out by CyberGnostics, Incorporated (award 9950671, ""Visualizing Statistics: An On-Line Introductory Course,"" a web-based introductory course marketed through Duxbury press). In sociology we are incorporating new materials being developed at San Francisco State University in the Urban Studies Department. The project directors are also developing an interdisciplinary, investigative course targeted for higher-achieving students in order to facilitate an heightened understanding of the relationship between the social, economic, and psychological worldviews and the methods of inquiry in these disciplines. The effectiveness of new materials is being evaluated in a multi-tiered approach, including an assessment of students' mastery of concepts, attitudinal and self-efficacy changes, and the breadth of implementation. The materials developed are also being disseminated through presentations at CUNY faculty development seminars, the CUNY-wide disciplinary councils and through the resources of the CUNY WEB-based community.

They can be activated by both environmental stimuli (e.g. chemicals, light, temperature, pressure) and intracellular stimuli (e.g. calcium and G protein coupled receptors). More than 50 different TRP channels have been identified in organisms ranging from yeasts and protists to mammals. The experiments in this project will extend the study of TRP channels into one of the most primitive metazoans with a nervous system, the cnidarian Hydra. A characteristic of all the Cnidaria is the possession of stinging cells called cnidocytes, which in Hydra are responsible for prey capture, adhesion and locomotion. Although significant progress has been made in understanding development and regeneration in Hydra, the molecular mechanisms that control Hydra behaviors such as its feeding response and cnidocyte release are as of yet poorly understood. An examination of the Hydra genome revealed the presence of multiple candidate Hydra TRP channel genes. Whole mount in situ hybridization will be used to localize TRP channel expression to specific Hydra body regions. TRP channel function will be examined by testing known chemical TRP channel activators and inhibitors to determine if they affect Hydra feeding behavior or cnidocyte release, and if they affect the ability of Hydra to regenerate or to form buds during asexual reproduction. In addition, RNA interference will be used to silence the expression of specific Hydra TRP channels. The resulting TRP(-) hydra will then be tested in the functional assays to determine the effect of TRP channel gene silencing. The study of Hydra TRP channels could answer fundamental questions about the signal transduction systems involved in Hydra behaviors and development. A comparison of the primitive TRP channels in Hydra with the more recently evolved TRP channels of higher organisms will provide a useful mechanism for both structure-function analysis and for studying evolutionary relationships. <br/><br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS <br/>Queensborough Community College (QCC) is an urban community college with a student population comprised of nearly equal numbers of Asians, Caucasians, Latinos and African Americans. Many of QCC's students come from low-income families, and are the first in their family to attend college. One of the goals of this project is to afford QCC undergraduates the opportunity to do research in a scientific laboratory. In the course of their research, students will learn Hydra culture methods, basic molecular biology techniques and DNA/protein sequence analysis. As the research in this project spans the spectrum from DNA sequence to development and behavior, students will learn how to make connections between events at the molecular level and those occurring at the level of the entire organism. In addition, since the TRP channel gene family is found in both very simple organisms such as yeast and in complex organisms like mammals, students will need to think in evolutionary terms when analyzing TRP channel function. Firsthand experience gained by working in a laboratory allows students to connect the theoretical concepts they learn in the classroom with real-world experiences. This will enhance their understanding of scientific concepts, and will give them the opportunity to apply their knowledge to their experiments in the laboratory. Student participation in research increases retention and graduation rates, a particularly important benefit at a community college like QCC, and undergraduates who are exposed to research early during their college careers are more likely to choose STEM majors and to remain in STEM careers."

While active learning methods have been effective in promoting successful student learning and countering common student misconceptions, almost no work has been done on adapting active learning methods to meteorology at a community college.  Student misconceptions related to concepts in meteorology are being examined, and active learning modules that entail observation and analysis of physical phenomena related to meteorology are being introduced in class.  The objective is that students develop a better appreciation of science, a deeper understanding of relevant scientific principles, as well as increased scientific literacy as a result of these modules.  This project is also intended to have a positive impact on student retention and performance, as many suffer from math and science anxiety and have had negative experiences with traditional science classes.

Natural processes can produce extremely tiny, highly organized structures that are less than 1000 times the thickness of a human hair, yet lead to remarkable properties. Humans are doing their best to learn how to mimic nature. The ability to accurately and consistently create objects on this scale is predicted to revolutionize medicine, electronics, manufacturing, building materials, and even fashion. We are proposing the acquisition of a scanning electron microscope that will magnify objects by up to 10,000 times, allowing us to see some of these important structural details. This microscope fits on a standard tabletop, can be operated with minimal training, and has few maintenance requirements. It is ideal for use in undergraduate research at community colleges, which are attended nationally by nearly 44% of science and engineering graduates. It will be used in many divisions of science and technology, including the development of efficient methods for creating biosensors applicable to human health issues such as diabetes management. A second project will explore new methods for producing tiny metal particles that will increase the efficiency of important chemical conversions. A third project will examine the structures that influence the properties of gem-quality pearls. Outreach projects in biology and electrical and computer engineering technology will also be developed for local students and teachers in grades 7-12. The electron microscope is integral to all of this work because it can reveal the structural origin of the useful properties of synthetic and natural materials. Further, the hands-on experiences made possible with this instrument are expected to inspire more students to enter and remain in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.<br/><br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>We are proposing the acquisition of a benchtop scanning electron microscope (SEM) and sputter coater. These instruments will be used by several investigators for research and teaching in chemistry, geology, biology, and electrical and computer engineering technology (ECET). The first project explores the influence of molecular structure and reaction conditions on the nanoscale morphology of the conducting polymer polyaniline and its ring-substituted derivatives. Using these materials, we will develop a one-pot method to fabricate an enzyme-based biosensor composed of a conductive polymer matrix with embedded metal nanoparticles. Glucose/glucose oxidase is our preliminary target, but we will extend this work to other enzyme-substrate systems. The second project is the novel synthesis of biodegradable polysilyl esters catalyzed by the formation of metal nanoparticles. Dispersible, polymer-stabilized palladium nanoparticles are also being investigated as catalysts in the chemo-selective reduction of conjugate double bonds. The third project will characterize the gemological nature of pearls sold in the New York gem trade, including features such as color, luster, surface perfection, sphericity, etc. These are related to the pearls' microstructure, which is easily investigated by microscopy and whose origin depends on variations in the amounts of mineral matter (aragonite and calcite), organic material (the protein conchiolin), and water. Ready access to SEM will allow us to optimize reaction conditions to produce nanostructures with useful properties and will uncover the physiochemical origin of macroscopic properties in naturally occurring materials. This particular electron microscope requires minimal training to operate and has few maintenance and facilities needs, making it ideal for undergraduate research in nanoscience/technology at a community college, as well as for outreach projects in biology and ECET for local students and teachers in grades 7-12. The hands-on experiences made possible with this instrument are expected to inspire more students to enter and remain in STEM fields."

Students are characterizing the output of a                   distributed feedback laser by measuring it output power,                        linearity, central wavelength, and spectral width using power                   meters, monochromators, and scanning interferometers.  They are                 assembling and testing an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA)                   system.  Using a leveled sine-wave generator as a driving                       source or an LED and a DFB laser, appropriate detector and a                    wide bandwidth oscilloscope, they are measuring amplification                   and linearity of the EDFA for a range of signal strengths.                      They are also measuring bit error rate using a BERT driving a                   DFB laser source, sending a signal through a length of fiber                    with and without amplification by an EDFA.  Finally, they are                   using two DFB lasers as sources to make a narrowly-spaced (in                   wavelength) wavelength division multiplexer which inputs its                    signal to an EDFA before the demultiplexing stage.

These materials, in conjunction with materials developed on a previous project, constitute a complete package of photonics courses with laboratories for remote students.  In order to encourage the sharing of facilities nationwide, the group is developing a database of remote-controlled laboratories, which is being hosted on their website.  They plan to link this site to those of national organizations, such as SPIE.  Evaluation plans include soliciting feedback from students on the textbooks and laboratory materials, monitoring student performance, and obtaining feedback from the employers whose employees are taking the courses. National workshops are being used to disseminate the materials and to help teams at other locations undertake the development of similar programs."

The courseware/laboratory system design consists of WebLAB, which is web-based courseware with built-in instrument controls, and the e-LAB instrumentation device, which is a computer-controlled laboratory instrument box connected between a test circuit wired on a protoboard and the student's computer. The web-based courseware contains all the engineering concepts and instructions to successfully build a robot and to understand all aspects of its operation. The modules contain background material, tutorials, structured questions, calculations and verifications of theory, graphing tools, laboratory report preparation through the use of templates, report questions that require independent and collaborative research, experiment evaluation and feedback, and integrated assessment tools for evaluating module effectiveness. Project assessment includes content and delivery evaluation by faculty and students at this institution and at two other diverse institutions. Results are disseminated by publications and conference presentations, and courseware is widely available on the internet and easily adaptable by other engineering and technical institutions."
