The amount of the scholarships is dependent upon the individual student's unmet financial need; a consequence is that varying numbers of scholarships are being funded each year.  The student population is 83% minority and 65% female; hence the scholarship program at this institution is increasing the numbers of individuals from these groups entering occupations in which they are traditionally underrepresented.  A pool of over 370 students meets all the requirements (CSEMS major, financial aid and GPA) for receiving a scholarship.  The application and selection process requires a written essay and an interview by the selection committee.<br/>The institution has excellent student support services that result in a first year retention rate of 65% - somewhat above the national rate.  Included among the support services are student electronic portfolios, the LaGuardia Career and Transfer Center, student mentor program, a supervised internship program, tutorial centers, an employment and career services center, counseling, and the use of learning communities. Student surveys repeatedly have shown a majority of the students dropping out do so because of financial reasons.  With the ability to ameliorate the financial problems with scholarships, the goal of 80% of CSEMS scholars either transferring to senior colleges or graduating with an Associate degree and becoming employed in a CSEMS field after two years of study is being met.  <br/>"

The goals are to bring IT education and skills training to the unique and underserved multi-ethnic residents and business population of Brooklyn and Queens. The project creates a comprehensive, interdisciplinary curriculum that emphasizes experimental learning and industry internships for students and faculty and leads to an A.A.S. degree in New Media. A total of 200 students will be enrolled and no less than 15 faculty members will be trained and participate in externships. The project will also establish skill standards, based on those developed by ACM and the Northwest Center for Emerging Technologies. The project will collaborate with the New York New Media Association, Consolidated Edison of New York, Queens County Overall Economic Development Corporation, and other area businesses and community organizations to form an advisory board and set benchmarks. The Northwest Center for Emerging Technologies also serves as the project evaluator.<br/>"

The                    college has acquired the equipment necessary to expose students                 particularly to spectroscopy (spectrometer, sensitive balance and               computers and related software).  Spectroscopy has become the                   standard technique for determining the structure of products                    formed in a chemical reaction;  the students are using the                      equipment in organic chemistry classes.                                                                                                                         Through the equipment, the students have gained an opportunity to               combine the theories of spectroscopy with experimental                          experience, learning its diverse and powerful applications first                hand.  This project is particularly significant because it goes                 beyond simply modernizing a laboratory to increasing student                    awareness of growing critical issues in science such as pollution               generated by waste chemicals, and introducing them to a cost-                   effective means of dealing with such issues.  Further, the                      instrumentation is helping the college provide quality science                  education to a student body which consists predominantly of women               (66%), educationally and economically disadvantaged individuals                 (72%), and members of ethnic minorities (80%).  This is not only                enhancing their science education, but is also helping to                       stimulate and motivate these students towards further                           participation in the scientific arena.                                                                                                                          The institution has contributed to this project in an amount                    equal to the NSF funds."

The decision to restructure the curriculum is based on an analysis of students' difficulties in successfully completing the extensive content to be covered in this course in a semester of only 12 weeks and the fact that the success rate in upper-level courses indicates that even students who pass may be in jeopardy in precalculus and calculus. In addition, in the present structure, students receive no college-level algebra instruction prior to precalculus. While the department has had significant success in infusing new teaching methodologies in precalculus and calculus resulting in significantly higher pass rates, hundreds of students never make it to these upper-level courses because of their poor preparation. The department is using this project to do a better job of preparing the vast majority of students who start out in developmental mathematics for upper-level precalculus and calculus courses.    Central to this project is the transformation of sections of these developmental courses along with sections of precalculus and calculus into multimedia laboratory courses where students work individually and in small groups on state-of-the-art, interactive, CD-ROM-based instruction, supported with accompanying texts that contain exploratory environments, video clips, simulations, explanations, and exercises. Using this new technology, students work on modules at their own pace, taking proficiency exams when they are ready. The self-paced nature of the new CD-ROM technology makes better use of the additional time students have in this course."

Sternbach will take environmental portraits of researchers, scientists and support staff going about their daily activities in and around the U.S Antarctic Program's Palmer Station. The lyrical documentary work will focus on ""the heroes of the effort to help save the earth."" As a professor and active contributor within his community, Mr. Sternbach will share his Antarctic experiences and images with students and citizens in the urban centers of New York and its environs and through the galleries and museums in New York and beyond. <br/><br/>The public audiences reached through his work as an artist and educator is significant.  His quest to impart his urban students with direct exposure to Antarctic research and the continent through his photography will have lasting impact. Of particular significance is the audience that will be reached via this project, which is in accordance with the NSF's Strategic Plan and the core value of being ""Broadly Inclusive"" defined in part as ""...reaching out especially to groups that have been underrepresented..."" In keeping with this goal, his project emphasizes the broader impacts of both the scientific discovery as interpreted by the artist and subsequently the resulting artistic and literary works which will be made available to a sizeable underrepresented public audience, thereby increasing public understanding of the Antarctic research and the region."
