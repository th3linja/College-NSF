Presently the electronic technology equipment at Nassau Community College consists exclusively of discrete, non-computerized measuring instruments. The project is incorporating data acquisition into the Electronics program at Nassau Community College through upgrading one of their two electrical measuring labs by the incorporation of state of the art computer-based ""virtual"" instruments. Students using this lab are being exposed to the concept of computer based data acquisition and computerized data analysis over the two years they are in the electronics program. The project builds the integration of the data acquisition equipment and analysis programs into every electronics course containing a laboratory portion. The students knowledge of data acquisition and analysis is being gradually expanded semester by semester as new aspects in this area are presented. Upon completion of the program the project equipment will allow the student to have a thorough understanding of data acquisition."

FOSS has become a major part of the software industry and is producing many world-class products.  Among these products are Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software products (HFOSS) that create social benefit in areas such as disaster relief, economic development, and health care.<br/><br/>Experience with undergraduate participation in HFOSS demonstrates a potential to motivate students, create excellent learning opportunities, and attract and retain female students in computing disciplines.  However, many instructors need professional development and a supporting community to bring HFOSS into their classes.  The Open Source Faculty Expertise (OpenFE) project is expanding the community of faculty with expertise in HFOSS and is also creating, organizing, and evaluating learning materials needed to integrate HFOSS into computing curricula in diverse settings including community colleges.  <br/><br/>OpenFE is building on prior NSF-funded work to reach a larger and more diverse student population.  Group informatics is being tested as an approach for creating and supporting instructor learning groups.  OpenFE is also incorporating FOSS community learning strategies such as Legitimate Peripheral Participation to create an innovative application of professional learning strategies to undergraduate computing education.<br/><br/>OpenFE is a collaborative project involving Drexel University, Western New England University and Nassau Community College."

The acquisition of 22 486 DX-2 mhz PC's with 17"" color monitors equips two classroom/laboratories for the teaching of calculus using the HCC materials for Calculus I-III with technology fully integrated. Computer usage occupies approximately one-third of clasq time where groups of three students work as a team at each computer station. The lab is available for student use outside of class time as well. Software, which includes lotus and Derive, is used for inquiry and understanding of concepts. Pedagogical techniques adapt the Treisman model applied to the community college environment by Wilkinson and Sher. Each group of three students work as a team on their group computer station in solving problems posed by the instructor. Assignments are designed for group interaction with interactive animated demonstrations of concepts in mathematics. The goal is improved performance for the students taking core mathematics curriculums. An assessment will compare affected students with a control group to test this hypothesis and to test the change in attitude realized."

The overall goal is to produce citizens who are capable of reading about and understanding contemporary scientific issues. Building on prior experience with FIPSE, NEH and projects to devise learning strategies and design multidisciplinary courses, the project (1) develops two multidisciplinary laboratory science courses for non-science students; (2) prepares materials so that these will be student-centered ""active learning"" courses; and (3) prepares faculty to teach these courses. As a result, after three years, the courses are to be mainstreamed into the Nassau Community College curriculum, 12 faculty are to be prepared to teach each course, and the courses and the materials prepared for them are to serve."

The approach takes advantage of, but does not require, computer workstations designed for group interaction with interactive animated demonstrations of ideas in mathematics and computer science. These group stations, funded under the Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program, are specifically designated for use by groups of three students. Groups work as a team to solve problems posed by the instructor. The group stations are also available after class for project preparation. The materials being developed illustrates precalculus and calculus concepts. The project is evaluating this approach by measuring retention rates, periodically surveying the students to measure changes in attitudes, and measuring the effect of laboratory courses on student grades. A variety of conference presentations and journal publications describe the results from our project. A laboratory manual and other materials are being produced for commercial publication as well as via the World Wide Web. The project principals are conducting a week-long course for community college and high school teachers to disseminate these ideas. Queensborough and Borough of Manhattan Community Colleges are serving as beta test sites."

HFOSS is open source software that improves the human condition, addressing needs in areas such as health care, disaster management, education, economic development, and accessibility.  Students will be provided with opportunities to positively impact their communities or others, which will engage and motivate traditionally underrepresented minorities and women to pursue careers in computing.  As a result, the OpenPath project will improve student learning and content retention, and will help students to develop professional skills and personal attributes.  <br/><br/>OpenPath will integrate two existing research initiatives: participation in HFOSS, and Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning in Computer Science (CS-POGIL).  In CS-POGIL, students work in small self-managed teams using specifically designed materials to construct their own knowledge.  In this project CS-POGIL will be used to scaffold early learning and help students develop team and process skills.  This early learning will support a transition to more independent learning in HFOSS environments.  Working in an HFOSS project provides students with the skills and professional experience needed to ensure a smooth pathway to the computing professions.  Multiple types of evaluations will enable the research team to track the progress of the project, to determine the legitimacy of the model created and its mapping to the curriculum, to understand the impact of the faculty and student activities, and to identify the student learning that occurs through participation in an HFOSS project."
