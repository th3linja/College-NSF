"2000454","Developing an E-book and Other Interactive Instructional Materials for Technician Education in Vacuum Technology","DUE","Advanced Tech Education Prog","10/01/2020","05/13/2020","Elena Brewer","NY","Erie Community College","Standard Grant","Tom Higgins","09/30/2023","$300,000.00","Nancy Louwagie","brewer@ecc.edu","121 Ellicott Street","Buffalo","NY","142032601","7168511416","EHR","7412","1032, 9178, SMET","$0.00","This project will develop an electronic textbook (E-book) to support vacuum technology education.  Vacuum technology is a critical, enabling technology for many industries, with semiconductor manufacturing being one of the largest.  According to the 2019 report from the Semiconductor Industry Association, the global semiconductor industry is a key growth sector in the global economy, with the US semiconductor industry accounting for almost half the global market share in 2018.  US-based industry semiconductor sales exceeded $200 billion in 2018 and the industry employs over 241,000 direct jobs.  Currently, a cohort of community colleges prepares manufacturing technicians for the US semiconductor industry.  Preparing technicians for this industry is a challenge for community colleges especially in complex technologies such as vacuum technology.  One of the challenges is finding technician-level textbooks and equipping learning environments that facilitate the development of industry-needed skills.  The E-book is expected to fill this need through its text and its associated animations, tutorials, video demonstrations, and interactive assessments.<br/><br/>This project will convert the first four chapters of the text ""Introduction to Vacuum Technology"" by David M. Hata into a modern electronic book. This format will increase access to vacuum technology instructional resources for both students and incumbent workers.  In addition, the project will develop a laboratory guide to help community college instructors develop hands-on learning environments for their students.  This laboratory guide will present options for implementing vacuum training systems, along with video demonstrations of equipment set-up and operation for laboratory experiments.  All materials will be classroom-tested at Erie Community College, Normandale Community College, and other partner colleges.  Erie Community College and Normandale Community College will license the e-book and associated resources through a Creative Commons license, and disseminate it with help of The Society of Vacuum Coaters, a professional society, and Lesker, Inc., a vacuum equipment supplier. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The new courses and certificate program, which are offered at all three campuses of Erie Community College, leverage courses and laboratory materials developed at other institutions, including those developed at SUNY Buffalo for a master's-level certificate program in information assurance.<br/><br/>The new curriculum incorporates the cybersecurity skill standards of the National Workforce Center for Emerging Technologies (NWCET), as well as aspects of the CNSS National Training Standards and the CompTIA Security+ framework.  The curriculum targets both traditional college students who wish to take courses in or specialize in information systems security and industry workers who wish to upgrade or retool their skills.  Two notable features of the curriculum are its emphasis on real-world problems and issues and its use of isolated computer network labs, which will enable students to participate in hands-on experiments with security penetration techniques and corresponding countermeasures and protective approaches.<br/><br/>"

This project, developed jointly by Erie Community College (N.Y.) and the State University of New York at Buffalo's Geography Department, addresses this need using a two-pronged approach. First, the GIS Curriculum Development Project will create a GIS Certificate Program for students to complete as part of their two-year degree program, or as a stand alone certificate. The project will develop a core of three (3) GIS-specific courses and a three (3) credit hour internship to provide students with a field experience component in their GIS Studies.    Secondly, this project will establish a GIS Infusion Program to train faculty in a variety of curricula to use GIS in their own courses within specific modules or applications. This will allow ECC students to develop experience and awareness of GIS and to learn how GIS technology relates to their own field of study. The GIS Infusion program will also develop a process for supplying GIS output directly to faculty for use in their classroom. This will allow GIS technology to reach a broader audience.      Two leading GIS educational institutions, the State University of New York at Buffalo and the University of California at Santa Barbara have agreed to lend their expertise in GIS technology, GIS curriculum development and faculty training to this project. The National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA) at the University of Buffalo will be also serve as project site for ECC students enrolled in the newly created GIS courses."

The project involves a regional collaborative partnership including a community college, four year colleges and universities, a public school district, and industries. The objectives are to develop, implement and evaluate new courses and educational materials, to develop a program web site to be shared by industry and academia, and to develop and implement ""train the trainer"" workshops for faculty. Undergraduate students are the primary target audience of the newly developed certificate course offerings. The project also provides professional development opportunities for college and university faculty, high school faculty and industry representatives as well as outreach to high school students.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Given that there is a lack of national framework for curricula and training development in digital forensics education, this project cuts across disciplines to generate a new knowledge set including security management and law enforcement perspectives. The project has three main objectives: (1) collaboration between faculty in computing and faculty in the Criminal Justice Department to develop new curricula in digital forensics for a certificate and/or A.S. degree in Computer Security and Investigations; (2) development of laboratory modules, which facilitates community college students' education for technician jobs in digital forensics, including the creation of CDs for training and tutorials; and (3) running of community-wide symposia to disseminate information to the general population about computer security and digital forensics. Unique features include (1) linkage with government agencies, companies, and other academic institutions through the Advisory Council; (2) cutting across disciplines to teach a hybrid mix of skills; (3) courses designed as modular courses to be offered as short courses or workshops for professional development for educators; and (4) website and web-based facilities that support the project, academic program, courses, and distance learning."
