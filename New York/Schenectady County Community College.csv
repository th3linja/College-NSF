To accomplish this goal              the College proposed the acquisition of an FTIR spectrophotometer,              an atomic absorption spectrophotometer, and two microcomputer                   systems.  These additions, along with existing instruments, allowed             for:  (1)  an increase in the number of student applications using              state-of-the-art instruments and microcomputers; (2)  an increase               in the diversity of the applications performed by students; (3)                 enhancement of the traditional techniques that students use for                 qualitative and quantitative analysis; (4) improvement of the                   state-of-the-art of the equipment that students encounter; (5)                  enhancement of student capabilities with computers; and (6)                     introduction of a new instrumental analysis course as an elective               for students.  The institution contributed to this project in an                amount equal to the NSF funds."

A  complete revision of the experiments currently done in the general  chemistry laboratory program underway and includes the development  of several new experiments expected to be of interest to others.   The project is designed to:  (1) Increase the number of student  applications using instruments interfaced with microcomputers; (2)  Improve student achievement in performance of quantitative  experiments; (3) to result in improved computational and computer  skills exhibited by students."
