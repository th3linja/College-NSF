Specialized technology programs at two-year college institutions and educational outreach programs in high schools benefit from the implementation of the RSL.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to enhance recruitment and training of technicians through the development of a remote studio laboratory concept. The goal is being met by increasing faculty ability to produce distance learning laboratory based curricula utilizing the studio approach, adapting materials being developed under an existing grant to a distance laboratory format, designing and developing a remote student laboratory prototype system where the laboratory is local to the student, and evaluating the distance lab prototype as an educational outreach tool to increase the awareness of the technician career choice at the high school level. Examples of activities include the development of a data and image acquisition portable laboratory and a set of laboratory exercises for an introductory physics and optoelectronics technology course. <br/><br/>Project outcomes include students with working knowledge of hands-on experiments which reinforce concepts in introductory courses. The RSL approach removes geographic and other barriers and is used to improve student learning. The RSL enhanced course is being used in high schools as a recruiting tool for technology education. <br/><br/>This project is in collaboration with National Instruments, the Infotonics Technology Center, Imaging and Sensing Technology, the COPE alliance, and Southern Tier Tech Prep. This network includes technology education partners at the high school, two-year college, four-year technology college, supplier, and industry level. Members at each level are evaluating the RSL hardware and laboratory experiments developed.<br/><br/>Materials developed by this project are being disseminated by web sites and via the Academic Solutions CD-ROM of National Instruments. Publication of the RSL prototype is expected in articles in The Physics Teacher, the International Journal of Engineering Education and at professional conferences.<br/><br/>"

The project is addressing these issues by retrofitting an existing engine lathe with digital readouts and a Bridgeport mill to emulate equipment found in small machine shops. Machinist students are acting as peer trainers to high school students enrolled in similar programs. Students who teach will truly learn their trade. In addition, the project is establishing a website linking all high schools, BOCES, and interested industrial shops to the college's site for the purpose of sharing information on projects, vendor demonstration schedules, student mentoring activities, and job opportunities. Students who are required to work in teams, and have some interaction with industry, make a much smoother transition to the team-oriented work environment. A coordinate measuring machine (CMM), SPC, and other digital readout devices are being incorporated into the college's metrology course to better prepare freshmen students for their summer co-op experiences and future work environment. Engineering technology students are being provided with a metrology course in which they can gain skills in SPC applications and concepts. Lastly, existing machining and measuring facilities are being brought up to the standards demanded by industry.  *"
