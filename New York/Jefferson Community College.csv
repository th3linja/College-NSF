The program provides $3,000 scholarships annually to 30 students who have academic ability and documented financial need, and who enroll full-time in our computer science, engineering, network technology or computer information systems (CSEM) associate degree programs. The program particularly targets women and first generation college students.<br/><br/>Two activities in particular contribute to the overall success of the scholarship recipients, as well as other students enrolled in these high technology curricula. The activities are:<br/>(a) intensive instructional support for historically difficult classes. A supplemental instruction program assists students in the targeted curricula who are enrolled in classes that have high attrition rates. Each of the five courses identified as historically difficult is a requirement for at least one of the CSEMS degree programs.<br/>(b) creation of a community of scholars to engage students receiving the CSEMS scholarships, faculty, alumni, local high school faculty, and local industry representatives in developing relationships and fostering an environment that supports and inspires students to achieve. <br/><br/>The project builds on existing relationships between high school faculty and guidance counselors to recruit and enroll academically gifted students. Student development events include annual scholars' reception, open house and a high technologies career forum. Opportunities for student enrichment activities, including internships with local industry, faculty mentoring, and field trips are being developed.<br/><br/>The goals of the program are to increase the number of :<br/>(1) educated workers prepared for placement in the high technology careers, especially in the region.<br/>(2) students recruited, enrolled, retained, graduated and transferring in the CSEMS disciplines.<br/>(3) underrepresented populations (women and first generation college students) enrolled and graduated in CSEMS majors.<br/>(4) quality of support services and educational opportunities available to students enrolled in the targeted curricula.<br/><br/>These goals are being assessed and evaluated by measuring annual rates of retention, graduation and transfer; subsequent success of transfer students at baccalaureate institutions; and employer satisfaction with our graduates."

Courses in astronomy have been part of Natural Science Division curriculum for the past four years. The laboratory course made possible with the grant can be taken concurrently with either Planetary or Galactic Astronomy. It is taught at an introductory level. The equipment will be used by students learning how to use a telescope, plan an observation, use the stellar coordinate system, photograph celestial events and develop their own images. Furthermore, students study planetary surfaces by means of laser video disc images. The college is matching the award with an equal amount of funds."

Until now, students in the undergraduate organic classes were not able to get more than a glimpse of this methodology because of the lack of an NMR instrument of reasonable capability. The project involves purchase of an NMR instrument capable of proton decoupling, with a variable temperature probe. A spiral teaching approach introduces students to NMR techniques early in the semester and then uses the methodology throughout the year. Understanding the structure of the organic compounds is central to a good understanding of the reactivities and properties of the molecules. The curriculum provides a strong correlation between the structural features discussed in the classroom and the methodology that enables one to see it experimentally, and it enables students to learn by discovery. Students gather data on problems, then think them through to reach meaningful conclusions. This pedagogy rivets student interest in lab activities and helps them develop higher-order thinking skills, as well as analytical skills. Relating spin-spin splitting parameters to the structure of organic molecules and studying temperature and concentration effects on NMR spectra of compounds are primarily used. Open-ended lab projects assess the skills developed by the students. This project, with its use of NMR as a foundation for discovery-based learning, serves as a model for other undergraduate organic programs, providing a curriculum that balances creativity and structure in discovery-type labs. Projects and examples that work well in such a format can be fine-tuned. Specific discovery-based learning methods can be developed for dissemination in publications such as the Journal of Chemical Education and at educational conferences sponsored by the American Chemical Society."
