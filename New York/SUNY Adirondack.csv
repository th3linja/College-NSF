Pilot programs at Adirondack have shown that it is possible to transform the traditional mathematics classroom into an active laboratory environment with cooperative groups of students exploring concepts and real world problems. The project is producing curricular and instructional changes resulting from the GNA approaches in a wide variety of courses ranging from arithmetic through differential equations. Corresponding reforms in student outcomes include an improvement in problem solving and critical thinking skills, concept attainment, motivation, and making connections. This project is serving as a model of a hands-on, active mathematics learning experience for both high schools and universities."

To achieve this goal, a partnership between Adirondack Community College, four area school districts, and area business and industry will develop and implement an advanced applied mathematics course AM4 to follow and extend Tech Prep's Applied Math 1, 2, and 3. The courses and materials will conform to reform guidelines (Standards) established by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges, and the New York State Curriaulum, Instruction, and Assessment Framework for Mathematics, Science, and Technology. Mathematics will be viewed as a powerful tool for real world problem solving; calculators and computers will be integrated throughout this contextual approach. Labs will emphasize the hands-on nature of the course. The mathematics departments from Adirondack and the four area high schools have worked closely in the implementation of AM1, AM2, and AM3. Initial feedback indicates substantial success with the Center for Occupational Research and Development (CORD) materials. Desired student outcomes measured include an improvement in problem solving and critical thinking skills, concept attainment, motivation, and making connections. The project will serve as a model for cooperation between high schools, community colleges, and area business and industry in extending these desired outcomes to AM4. Materials will be produced for use by interested school districts from the Capital Region Consortium and throughout the nation. The course and materials will be widely disseminated through conferences and workshops, in journals, and possible publication as texts."
