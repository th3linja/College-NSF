The station, which belongs to the Finger Lakes Community College (FLCC) is one of only a few field stations in the U.S. that are operated by a community college. The MFS now provides field-based education through several academic programs, laboratory experiences, community outreach, and the opportunity to participate in or observe local research projects.  Undergraduate students, local K-12 students and teachers, community members, and environmental organizations/agencies already frequent the site.  Because of the demand for use of the MFS, FLCC intends to convene stakeholders to help identify best uses for the facility, determine science opportunities available in the surrounding glacial landscape, examine needs for expansion, and ultimately plan the future mission of the MFS.  The planning effort will include five workshops that address programming, facility and grounds enhancement, operational sustainability, research, and strategic plan development.  The project PIs will visit to other field stations and exchange ideas with key personnel from the Organization of Biological Field Stations (OBFS).  The project PIs have considerable experience conducting research, using industry-standard research technology, leading scientific based travel/study courses and working with local communities and municipalities to research environmental issues.  The workshops will capture creative input from stakeholders including teachers, administrators and students from all levels of education, representatives from local and state environmental organizations/agencies, field station directors, architects and interested community members.  The planning effort is expected to improve current science education efforts and to integrate scientific research into local decision-making processes."

The curriculum reform at both levels is being driven by undergraduate research initiatives developed under the mentorship of community college faculty.  Novel student research projects are being established during the first year and expanded in the advanced sophomore-level course.  The sophomore-level course curriculum includes training students as peer leaders to support the development of new student projects emerging from the freshman courses.  The broader impacts of the project include a week-long workshop, which is being utilized to train faculty from Finger Lakes Community College (FLCC) and two other community colleges (Genesee Community College and Monroe Community College) in field and laboratory methods.  To achieve the project goals, FLCC is collaborating with the National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science, NSF #0341279) and Braddock Bay Raptor Research to develop project materials and research projects.

In partnership with the Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR), CCURI has developed a fully-integrated model for integrating undergraduate research at a community college. This project aims to: 1) Expand a modified version of the CCURI model to 16 additional community colleges; 2) Implement a comprehensive evaluation of the CCURI model on student learning, competency, and retention in STEM; 3) Measure the impact of the CCURI model on developing institutional capacity at the 16 additional community colleges that are committed to developing an undergraduate research program; and 4) Disseminate the modified CCURI model of integration and the customized versions of the model as they exist at the institutional partners within CCURI. <br/><br/>This proposal is responsive to the recommendations for biology education reform called for in both Vision and Change: A Call To Action (NSF/AAAS) and the BIO 2010 report (NRC). CCURI is working toward a fully validated strategy that community colleges can look to in understanding how to initiate reform. The CCURI model is novel in that it was developed from a Root Cause Analysis of the unique barriers that community colleges face in sustaining UR programs. The project includes economic impact metrics as a tool for evaluating a Community College Faculty Model and leverages a partnership with Tennessee Tech & their CAT instrument to capture gains in critical thinking skills - an outcome with implications beyond biology. <br/><br/>This project is creating and sustaining a national network of Community Colleges committed to bringing the UR experience into biology curriculum. The model is helping community colleges overcome the unique barriers that have prevented them from employing the power of the UR pedagogy in the education of approximately 45% of all U.S. undergraduates including underrepresented groups and students who are the first generation of their family to attend college. The results from the extensive evaluation plan is being widely disseminated and used to refine the model for integrating the UR experience at a community college."

These numbers account for 45% of all U.S. undergraduates, and highlight the increasing impact that community colleges are having on the education of post-secondary students. Several recent reports have made recommendations on the importance of providing an authentic undergraduate research experience in the first two years of a student's post-secondary education. While evidence continues to mount regarding what needs to be accomplished, little is known about how to achieve the desired reform. What is needed is a model of reform that can be tested, evaluated, refined, characterized and disseminated nationally. The Community College Undergraduate Research Initiative (CCURI) is a national consortium of community colleges, four-year institutions, government agencies, and private organizations dedicated to the development, implementation, and assessment of sustainable models for integrating an undergraduate research experience into community college STEM programs.<br/><br/>This project will support an expansion of the CCURI network, along with the addition of several enhancements to the model, and support research related to the impact of the CCURI model on institutional culture change, faculty instructional practices, and student persistence in STEM pathways. Two main questions will guide the research and evaluation efforts of this project. 1) How does an institution move from a culture of ""no research"" to a culture of ""research as the norm,"" with research as an integral part of the student experience? 2) What factors promote or constrain culture change from ""no research"" to ""research as the norm?"" Data gathered in response to these questions will improve the STEM undergraduate enterprise's understanding of the impact of a research experience during the first two years of a community college STEM program. In addition, the expansion of the CCURI network will lead to the creation of a southwest regional network of community college Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). This expansion provides opportunities for studies to be conducted with respect to the effectiveness of the CCURI model on institutions that serve predominantly underrepresented groups."

""Community College Undergraduate Research: Building a Model of Integration"" involves the design, implementation and evaluation of a model for integrating undergraduate research into a community college science curriculum. The project involves the use of scientific principles contained within a portfolio of ongoing research programs to develop inquiry-based educational materials (such as problem-based learning modules and case studies) for freshman biology courses. These materials are then being expanded into an undergraduate research experience within a credit-bearing, transferable, advanced sophomore-level course. The sophomore-level course curriculum includes training students as peer-leaders to support the development of new student projects emerging from the freshman courses and supports the creation of an educational environment where research and education are integrated. The project involves a collaboration of five community colleges, one four-year school, four environmental research organizations, and a state government agency.<br/> <br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed project lies in establishing an adoptable model that supports community college efforts to shift to inquiry-based and project-based coursework, to get community college students engaged in undergraduate research, and to make connections to four-year college science programs and their undergraduate research efforts. The project addresses many of the barriers associated with conducting undergraduate research at the community college level. Project evaluation is using a variety of approaches to address the success of the project in achieving its major objectives, which include improving student learning, increasing the involvement of both faculty and students in research, increasing the use of inquiry-based approaches by participating faculty, and increasing the level of interaction between the faculty at the participating community colleges and four-year institutions.<br/> <br/>The broader impacts of the proposal include its strong focus on improving the quality of science education at the community college level, where there are disproportionate number of students from underrepresented groups; the establishment of a network of community college faculty dedicated to project-based learning and undergraduate research; and an increase in the capacity of community colleges to prepare future scientists with the skills necessary to conduct scientific research. Plans for dissemination of project results include presentations and workshops at national meetings and student presentations at local and regional conferences.<br/><br/>"

Two computer-equipped classrooms, one for mathematics and one for science, are essential for the success of the project.   Each classroom provides an environment where students work in teams on activities designed to develop problem-solving skills and an understanding of course concepts.  Three types of activity are used to meet the objectives of the project. TYPE I activities are designed to introduce students to problem-solving methodologies using a real-life scenario and an innovative problem-solving model called the WHEEL. TYPE II activities involve students from one discipline in a direct interaction with students from another discipline. TYPE III activities use technology for instruction within a specific course. They are designed to guide students in their construction of knowledge. The software required for the computer equipped classrooms (10 computers each) are Minitab, a statistics package; Derive, a computer algebra system; Quattro-Pro, a spreadsheet program; and PCSOLVE, a general problem-solving software package.   This project can serve as a model for 2-year colleges to integrate a real-world problem-solving learning environment into their curriculum."
