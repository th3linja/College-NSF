This will be accomplished by developing a comprehensive, four-semester physics laboratory sequence based on the physics education and cognitive research based curriculum of Real-Time Physics. This curriculum relies upon the integration of microcomputers into the laboratory to perform data collection, analysis, and graphing, as well as to construct, execute, and display simulations of physical phenomenon. However, some units of Real-Time Physics are not yet commercially available and, even when completed, Real-Time Physics will not provide a comprehensive laboratory curriculum. Therefore, aspects of other curricula, including Workshop Physics, Tools for Scientific Thinking and Spreadsheet Physics will be integrated with Real-Time Physics into a four-semester laboratory curriculum. This project will encourage students to continue study in physics or engineering, help prepare MCC physics courses for the next century, and to stimulate other colleges, both two-year and four-year, to adopt this approach."

These workbooks, designed for use in an active learning environment, arrange topics such that students receive repeated exposure to concepts over an extended time interval, each time with an incremental increase in complexity. The workbooks make extensive use of alternative problem types, such as ranking tasks, goal-less problem statements, and critical analysis tasks. This project proposes the expansion and modification of the workbooks to make them a more attractive and viable alternative to traditional physics instruction at other institutions. In addition to the increased flexibility afforded by an expanded workbook series, support materials, including an instructor guide, student guide, and textbook, will be developed as part of the project. Revision of the workbooks and support materials will continue throughout the length of the project, under the supervision of an advisory committee drawn from both the two-year college physics community and the physics education research community. The project also gives special emphasis to community college students in Advanced Technological Education (ATE) programs to ensure that they are provided learning opportunities using the spiral notebooks."

Traditionally, this course has been viewed as a gatekeeper and students have considered the laboratory experience as an isolated and irrelevant use of their time. Reformed teaching methods that increase the relevance of the laboratory and increase student success have proven challenging to deliver, especially when laboratories are taught by graduate teaching assistants. This project, which builds on prior NSF-funded work (DUE Awards #1245160 and #1245176), will develop, implement, and study innovative and easy-to-adopt studio-based organic lab modules. These modules will transform the traditional 3-4 hour organic laboratory into a meaningful learning experience involving trouble-shooting problems and honing lab skills. The project is a collaborative effort between a research university (Rochester Institute of Technology) and a community college (Monroe Community College), which will ensure the materials are appropriate for use in both two-year and four-year settings. In collaboration with regional partners, studies will be conducted to evaluate student learning in other settings, as well as the ease of module adoption, student performance, and retention rates.<br/><br/>This project leverages earlier work developing a studio-based organic laboratory curriculum for two-year and four-year colleges, and promoting its broadened development and implementation. Central goals of the project are enhancing students' meaningful learning and engagement with organic chemistry, and developing a model for implementation of reform-based curricula. To determine the impact of this approach, the project will measure student learning and success, and evaluate the ease and fidelity of module adoption at collaborating institutions. Given the diverse population of students across the institutions committed to adopt the materials and the proximity to the National Technical Institute for the Deaf, further studies will identify retention trends for a diverse set of student populations. This will contribute to developing a more diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce. The results will be disseminated broadly via a PI-sponsored conference, peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, a website, and a textbook partnership."

This helps the teachers prepare their students to acquire the scientific and technological expertise needed in the region and the nation in the 21st century. This project is a collaborative effort facilitated by experienced MCC faculty working with a consortium of local school districts in the region. Secondary teachers and MCC faculty are working together to develop lesson plans that incorporate fundamental scientific principals, the appropriate modern laboratory materials and cooperative learning techniques. The principal aim is strengthening the skill of teachers by helping them to attain pedagogical content knowledge, or the blending of content and pedagogy into an understanding of how particular topics, problems, or issues are organized, represented, and adapted to the diverse abilities of the learner and presented for instruction. Science teachers are being recruited to participate in one-week summer workshops with appropriate follow-up activities in the next academic year. Over the three-year period, a total of 288 teachers are participating in workshops in four scientific disciplines: biology, chemistry, physics and earth sciences. The broader impacts of the WISE project address a need identified in a National Science Foundation Report (December 1998) that indicates many high school science students are taught by teachers with poor preparation in their discipline. The WISE project is giving preference in its application process to those teachers teaching in resource-poor urban or rural districts and lacking the discipline-based educational background. In addition to the critical shortage of teachers with discipline-based education, the WISE project is helping teachers address major revisions to the high school science curricula in New York State. The major aims of the revised curricula are to increase students' scientific literacy, problem solving and reasoning skills. Some key features of the project are: instruction and supervision by experienced, well-qualified MCC faculty; hands-on training in the use of modern technology, instrumentation and software; secondary teachers bringing the equipment/software back to their home schools; teachers working cooperatively to develop laboratory projects and experiments; participation of teachers from schools with large minority populations (Rochester City School District); participation of teachers from high-need rural school districts; follow-up activities to assist and reward teachers in implementation; emphasis on pedagogical content knowledge; and a web page for continuous sharing of materials and networking. The WISE project is being evaluated by independent, professional evaluators to assess the impact of the project on teacher knowledge, attitudes, and the impact on their classroom activities. Project results are being disseminated nationally and regionally through journal publications, conference presentations, and a web site."

These stand-alone modules enable instructors to quickly demonstrate certain concepts as well as display specific information not easily represented in the general visualization-exploration tool. Customization of these applets is possible allowing favorite functions and settings and relevant parameters to be saved in a custom web page, generated by the parent applet, which can then be posted on the user's own website. The intellectual merit of the project lies in the experience of the PI who has created more than ninety Java applets supporting four major calculus textbooks (Anton, Thomas, Varberg, and Salas). Furthermore, the dynamic visualization tools under development enhance the teaching and learning of multi-variable calculus. The project is exerting a broader impact on the mathematical sciences community by providing reliable visualization tools for educators to use to enhance their teaching in calculus. Moreover, the tools are usable in engineering and physics classes.

The second stage will incorporate the use of 3D solid modeling in our engineering graphics class along with a design and build project which will involve a student team consisting of both Engineering Science and Tooling and Machining students. Implementation of both stages of this plan requires the addition of 14 computers, Mathematical and AutoCAD software, and a later printer to our Engineering Science laboratory. This equipment would be installed in the summer of 1998 and would be ready for use in the fall of 1998. The first stage will begin with the integration of the curricula of Calculus 3 (MTH 212) with Introductory Circuits (ENR 253) in the fall of 1998. Mathematical software will be used in the Circuits (ENR 254) laboratory to model analog circuits. Math and Engineering faculty will work closely so that the examples used in Calculus are relevant to circuit modeling and analysis. During the Spring of 1999, a similar approach will be used with Differential Equations (MTH 225) and Circuits (ENR 254). In the fall of 1999, the second stage will begin with the use of 3D solid modeling with AutoCad in the engineering graphics class (ENR 153). In addition to creating computer models of mechanical assemblies, students will also work in teams with students from the MCC Tooling and Machining department to complete a design and build project."
