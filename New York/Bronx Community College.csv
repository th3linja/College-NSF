Through support of 20 to 25 students each year, the central goal of the program is to increase the number of well-prepared BCC graduates in scientific fields - both those who continue to a four-year college and those who directly join the high technology work force.  Scholarship recipients are recruited from mathematics, science and scientific technology courses at BCC as well as from local high schools as they matriculate at BCC.  The METS Scholarship Program also supports scholarship recipients who graduate from BCC and transfer to a four-year institution of the City University of New York for their junior year, if they are still in good academic standing, are full-time students, and are research associates with a BCC faculty mentor.  In total, a student can be supported for a maximum of six semesters.  <br/><br/>Student scholars and BCC faculty members constitute the METS Academy, modeled on BCC's Science Academy and Honors Program.  In the Academy, each student is assigned a faculty member who is the student's mentor and advisor throughout the student's participation in the program.  Since all students in STEM fields take calculus and either chemistry or physics, student cohorts arise through participation in common courses.  In addition, the chairs of the mathematics, physics and chemistry departments meet to determine the schedules for the courses so that they do not overlap.  This enables the same students to take Calculus I or II with Physics I or II or Chemistry I or II.  As Biology majors have to take four semesters of chemistry, they also benefit from this block scheduling.  Additional student support services of the METS Academy further enhance mutually supportive cohort relationships.  For example, the Academy sponsors talks by alumni who are continuing their education or who work in the technology industry.  The Academy also offers tutoring, including peer-led enrichment workshops in physics and mathematics for science and engineering students through a collaboration with Hostos Community College.  To further students' understanding of scientific research, the METS Academy provides students with information about research opportunities and encourages them to enroll in a Research Enrichment Seminar.   As they approach their later semesters at BCC, scholarship recipients are directed to the Office of Career Services for workshops on interviewing skills and resume writing and to the Transfer Center as they approach graduation. <br/><br/>Success of the METS Scholarship Program is being studied by evaluating the following: <br/>     -  percentage of scholarship recipients who graduate and transfer to a STEM major at a four-year college or find employment in the technology area; <br/>     -  increased enrollment in STEM fields at BCC; <br/>     -  an increase in the number of women enrolled in STEM majors at BCC; and <br/>     -  the number of high school students who enroll in STEM programs at BCC."

This study uses a multidisciplinary approach (paleontology, paleoecology, comparative anatomy, experimental biology) to ask questions about how extinct populations of hominins behaved on their natural landscapes. Specifically, the investigators will analyze lower jaws (mandibles), among the most commonly represented parts of the skeleton in the early human fossil record, of modern great apes and two early species of extinct hominins (Autralopithecus), to understand how the structure of the mandible is related to changes in feeding behavior and diet. The research will provide new data about how changes in diet and feeding behavior transformed our anatomy across time, permitting more robust explanations of the processes by which we became human. Broader impacts will include undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral training in the latest analytical techniques for fossil analyses; outreach to primary and secondary school science teachers and students using hands-on experiences and web-based content designed to enhance teaching and learning about human origins; and the production of a unique collection 3D data for modern apes and rare fossil specimens that will be available to the scientific community.<br/><br/>Mandibles are the most common element in the hominin fossil record after teeth; they are used to diagnose species, test phylogenetic hypotheses, and infer feeding behavior and diet. However, extensive theoretical and experimental work on extant primates has not clarified which aspects of variation in mandibular form are related to variation in the positions of the tooth row, jaw muscles and jaw joint, which are related to the mandible's resistance to internal forces, and how these relate to feeding behavior and diet. Furthermore, the classical consensus on the relationship between dentognathic morphology and diet in Plio-Pleistocene hominins - adaptation to processing mechanically resistant foods - has been challenged by recent inferences from dietary isotopes, occlusal microwear, and finite element modeling, which do not converge on a shared view of early hominin diets and feeding behavior. This lack of consensus is especially glaring in light of the rich fossil record of mandibles for the Australopithecus anamensis-A. afarensis lineage (4.2-3.0 Ma), which documents clear changes in dentognathic morphology and carbon-isotope signatures over time. The primary focus of the proposed research is an integrative investigation of how spatial and mechanical determinants of mandibular form track change in diet and feeding behavior in extant hominids (great apes and humans) and early Australopithecus.  The research is organized under three specific aims: 1. Quantifying and comparing the location, magnitude and nature of external and internal morphological variation in mandibles of extant (Homo, Pongo, Pan, and Gorilla) and fossil (A. anamensis, A. afarensis) hominids via computed tomography and geometric morphometrics; 2. Testing specific hypotheses about the biomechanical significance of variation in hominid mandibular morphology via finite-element models; and 3. Evaluating the extent to which spatial positioning of masticatory system components (tooth row, jaw joint, and muscle attachment points) explain variation in mandibular morphology across extant hominids and early Australopithecus. The project will provide new data on the structural and functional determinants of early hominin mandibular morphology, to help identify the factors that drove these morphological changes and allow tests of adaptive hypotheses about the early evolution of the genus."

Model theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies mathematical structures and their definable sets (i.e., the basic sets that ""live"" in those structures). On the other hand, differential and difference equations are equations that describe how things change with time and are the fundamental tools that modern science and engineering use to model physical reality. The basic idea of the project will be to view the set of solutions of a differential or difference equation as a definable set in an appropriate structure, and use the tools of model theory to understand its properties. The equations that the project focuses on -- the Painlevé differential and difference equations and the Schwarzian differential equations -- appear in many important physical applications such as statistical mechanics and general relativity, as well as in important problems in number theory. <br/><br/>The project builds on recent successes by model theorists to use techniques from geometric stability theory to classify special cases of these differential equations according to the trichotomy theorem in differentially closed fields of characteristic zero. The investigator will extend his work on the generic Painlevé (differential) equations to non-generic ones as well as to the Schwarzian equations. The objective is to both fully describe the structure of the sets of solutions and to use such descriptions to better our understanding of geometrically trivial sets in the theory. This work is expected to have applications to problems in number theory and functional transcendence theory. The project will also transport some of the ideas and techniques used to study classical differential equations to the difference setting. The main challenge will be to develop a notion of irreducibility (in the sense of classical functions) for difference equation and show that the difference Painlevé equations are irreducible. In addition to model theory, the work will also employ techniques from algebra and geometry and from the analytic study of differential/difference equations."

Among the conventional methods used for lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment are dilute acid, steam explosion, ammonium fiber expansion and organic solvent extraction. Unfortunately, these methods are limited in terms of feedstock tolerance, energy costs and formation of by-products that inhibit downstream fermentation. This team is pursuing the commercialization potential of a class of ionic liquids (termed Bionic Liquids) derived from renewable materials.  Ionic liquids are liquid salts with low vapor pressures, high conductivities and thermal stabilities with remarkable solvating abilities for a wide range of substrates.  As such, ionic liquids are ideal solvents for biomass pretreatment because they can completely dissolve biomass by simple heating and stirring, stripping the cellulose away from the by-product stream.<br/><br/>Biomass pretreatment for the production of fuels and renewable chemicals from cellulose is the largest customer need that will be met by Bionic Liquids. Using the ""closed-loop"" biorefinery method whereby lignin and hemicellulose by-products are converted to Bionic Liquids, an unlimited supply of these remarkable renewable solvents can be produced. A biorefinery can then choose to use the Bionic Liquids in-house, or tailor their chemistries by manipulating the cation and anion combinations to meet demand across a variety of renewable energy (i.e. battery, solar) and synthetic chemistry markets (i.e. pharmaceuticals)."

The first is the decomposition theory of projective modules and pure-projective modules, where realizing and omitting finitely generated positive primitive types one can obtain and classify interesting new examples of projective and pure-projective modules. In the second area, of cotorsion theories, the investigators intend to establish and apply the interplay with the Ziegler spectrum in order to describe the flat cover and the realm of cotorsion modules that are not pure-injective. The third part is about calculation of Ziegler spectra of string algebras as a contribution to representation-theoretic classification and to decidability theory and about the related issue of super-decomposable pure-injectives. As a fourth, more general model-theoretic topic of study, the investigators propose to apply classical model-theoretic constructions to pairs of structures endowed with an epimorphism in order to obtain existence results in `dual' or `projective' model theory (dual in the sense that monomorphisms are replaced by epimorphisms). <br/><br/><br/><br/>The model-theoretic study of mathematical structures is unique in that one restricts to a certain formal language, similar to a computer language. The loss of richness of expression allows for a gain on the side of the structures under investigation: more structures come into play, because the language cannot distinguish between them. (To persue the analogy with computers: a computer may not be able to distinguish between an infinite object and a large finite chunk of it.) The advantage of this approach is that one discovers new structures (models of the formal statements describing the initial structure) that may be very similar to the original structure at hand when the statements mentioned are chosen as to force them to be. It has found striking applications in various parts of mathematics over the last decades."

The workshop will bring together scientists and historians from around the world to present their research on one of the most important controversies in the history of Twentieth Century biology, the Lysenko Affair: In 1948 the Soviet agronomist T.D. Lysenko received the support of Joseph Stalin and the Central Committee of the Communist Party to ban genetics in the Soviet Union, an edict soon enforced throughout the Communist Bloc.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The workshop will contribute to ongoing research in the fields of history and philosophy of science, environmental history, and the Cold War. It will bring together scholars at every level and across disciplines and strengthen relationships with scholars working in related areas of research. Workshop participants will address a variety of pertinent topics such as the impact and reaction to Lysenkoism in various international contexts, the role of Darwinism and Lamarckism in the Lysenko controversy, and the relationship between Lysenkoism and other topics in the history of Cold War science, the history of biology, and the histories of other scientific disciplines.<br/><br/>Potential Broader Impacts<br/>The workshop will be part of a series of activities inaugurating the University of Vienna's graduate program, titled ""The Sciences in Historical, Philosophical and Cultural Context."" Partnering with a European university will significantly expand the scope of research and foster international ties in the field. The results of the workshop are to be published."

This is being accomplished through the use of four automatic titrators in conjunction with four micro-computers. This permits students to design and control automatic titrations; to collect and process data; to learn a greater number of volumetric methods including colorimetric, potentiometric and pH titrations; and to become familiar wtih the application of computers to new and old methods of analysis. The automatic titrator/computer is being used to do a series of titrations involving acids and bases; redox titrations; and potentiometric titrations. The equipment is being used to teach students about a greater number of analytical techniques and making it easier to use the laboratory experiments to reinforce theoretical topics covered in the lecture. It is also enabling the teaching of methods of analysis through the use of computer simulation. In addition many laboratory skills are being taught in a more efficient and meaningful manner through the use of computers in the laboratory setting. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources."
