A diverse and highly-skilled workforce is needed to support the economic growth in this area of manufacturing. To help address his need, Mohawk Valley Community College will partner with two colleges to develop a new training model for manufacturing technicians. These partners will develop courses that cover the most advanced technologies in this field, including metal 3D printing. The project team will partner with local industries to ensure that the courses contain the knowledge and skills desired for the workforce. The courses will include the use of remotely-shared 3D printing equipment for student design projects. The remote lab equipment will represent a model for colleges across the country to prepare students with the necessary skills, even if the colleges have limited budgets to purchase their own equipment. This model will reduce cost barriers for institutions and help increase the number of technicians that can be trained. The training model will provide options for current workers who want to upgrade their skills. The project will also create introductory courses for secondary school students, who will also be able to use the remotely-shared 3D printing equipment.<br/><br/>This project seeks to increase the number of skilled technicians in additive manufacturing design processes, with a special focus on metal 3D printing. The goals include: the development of a one-semester, 18-credit curriculum comprised of five courses that cover modeling, materials, and additive manufacturing topics; the development of a remote lab-sharing model for the curriculum that will be tested with the partner institutions, Finger Lakes Community College and Western Technical College; and research on the efficacy of the curriculum on student outcomes when used in local-lab versus remote-lab learning environments. Students at the partnering institutions will be able to remotely access the lab equipment to print prototypes, which will then be shipped back to their campuses. The curriculum will be designed for either seamless integration into existing two-year engineering technology programs or as a standalone microcredential option for incumbent workers. Dual-credit high school courses and mini modules for existing high school courses will also be developed and implemented. An emphasis of this project will be on engaging and recruiting students from underrepresented populations to promote their interest in manufacturing careers and broaden participation in the technician workforce. Course materials, project results, and best practices will be widely disseminated to encourage the adoption or adaptation of the approach by other colleges and institutions across the country.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Working from a set of nationally validated skills standards developed during a comprehensive study by the Maricopa Advanced Technology Education Center (MATEC), Mohawk Valley Community College (MVCC) is partnering with twelve community colleges, industry leaders, and MATEC in this effort. Faculty development includes activities to identify and gain knowledge in key technologies and partnerships with experts in the field to develop methods of delivery and assessment for the subject materials. Wider dissemination to regional industries and secondary education teachers and students is through regional workshops.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project involves addressing a key need to meet educational requirements for operators and technicians in the evolving worldwide manufacturing market. Highly automated manufacturing operations are emerging in semiconductor, pharmaceutical, automotive, food processing and other industries. Education of personnel to maintain, install, upgrade, and troubleshoot these systems is therefore of significant national importance. The project addresses these needs by developing program enhancements that will be applied to existing Electrical, Mechanical, Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology and other degree programs at MVCC. Hands-on laboratory experiences using a highly automated system trainer provide real-time experiences by simulating current production methods. MVCC is partnering with MATEC to call upon their extensive experience in educational materials development to guide faculty in the creation learning activities using innovative concepts and delivery systems<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project are attained through wider dissemination of the materials and concepts developed, and the collegial relationships with other institutions and industries that the project provides. MVCC, as a partner with MATEC and 12 other colleges, is sharing the results of these efforts with a significantly larger group of individuals than would be addressed through a local effort alone. Through cooperation with industries supporting this program, including INTEL, IBM, SMC-IT, and regional industries, closer alliances between industry and education are being developed.<br/><br/>MVCC is an active supporter of several initiatives to encourage secondary school students to pursue careers in the technologies. The project is enhancing this effort through sponsorship of professional development workshops for secondary education teachers and demonstrations for students interested in entering this highly challenging field.<br/><br/>"

A highly-skilled, diverse workforce is needed to support this emerging sector. To meet this need, Mohawk Valley Community College will develop an educational model using microcredentials.  These microcredentials will document mastery of specific knowledge and skills related to the unmanned aerial systems industry, and ""stack"" to enable flexible training pathways. This strategy has the potential to help students develop initial competencies, while motivating them to persist toward a certificate or degree. The project will develop curricula for one-semester microcredentials, two-year degrees, and adapt these materials to support noncredit education in technician fields. Close collaborations with the local unmanned aerial systems industry cluster will help ensure that the curriculum meets industry needs. The project team will also work with the industry partners to develop hands-on lab and field exercises, and to foster student internship opportunities. The curriculum and materials developed in this project will be openly available for adaptation or replication at other institutions. The project has the potential to create resources that support education of the unmanned aerial systems workforce across the nation.<br/><br/>The project will aim to develop curriculum for six microcredentials; develop curriculum for two new associate degrees; refine the existing associate degree to align with categories of the microcredentials; and leverage these materials to support courses in unmanned aerial systems applications for emergency services, inspection, and agriculture. The curriculum will focus on preparing students to manufacture and repair unmanned aerial systems as well as analyze data collected on missions. The new associate degrees will be offered in Unmanned Aerial Systems Fabrication and in Unmanned Aerial Systems Electronics. In the new program structure, the microcredentials will be transferable between the degree tracks and accumulation of four microcredentials will be sufficient for students to earn the relevant associate degree. Project-based learning will be integrated through hands-on, industry-relevant student capstone and other projects. The courses will be designed to serve as pathways for current workers toward microcredentials or employment in the unmanned aerial systems sector. The project will conduct extensive outreach and recruitment of underrepresented populations to increase diversity in this technician field. The effectiveness of using microcredentials to address specific workforce skills and gaps will also be evaluated to determine if it can rapidly produce a skilled and diverse technical workforce. The results of the project will be broadly disseminated to assist other colleges in replicating and adapting the use of microcredentials for the unmanned aerial systems sector as well as other high-technology academic and workforce sectors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
