The student are being helped to take responsibility for his/her own learning by providing physics instruction in an environment with a heavy emphasis on direct observation and active student involvement. The already well- integrated laboratories at Jamestown Community College are being enhanced by the addition of computer data acquisition systems at each lab bench. Students, working in pairs or threes, are using this equipment to verify the laws of physics, by directly measuring force, motion, temperature, displacement, magnetic fields, etc., and by using computer tools such as spreadsheets, mathematical and graphics packages, and data acquisition software designed by Tools for Scientific Thinking at Tufts University. Furthermore, a powerful mathematics and graphing program called Mathematica is also being used to help students deal with difficult mathematics concepts. Via this project the college is building the laboratory resources necessary to move gradually toward a heavily observation-based approach to introductory physics, consistent with the nature of physics as an observation-based discipline. Nine Macintosh IIsi computers, equipped with Vernier U.L.I. data acquisition boards and analysis software, are being networked to a Quadra 900, which runs Mathematica 2.0, which was purchased earlier. This project has been designed in consultation with faculty at several colleges and universities. This cooperation should enhance the chances of project success and replication."

In the area of mechanics, there exists a growing body of teaching methods and materials which emphasizes direct observation and active student involvement. This project will identify, study, pilot test and evaluate a variety of similar approaches to the teaching of electricity and magnetism and selected topics in modern physics. A notebook of successful methods and materials will be a tangible outcome of our efforts to help students develop a solid conceptual understanding of topics in electricity and magnetism."

These instructors teach a new interdisciplinary first semester sub-cellular biology course at their schools which is infused with these research experiences. High school students taking this course also have the opportunity to do summer research at JCC. The project also provides JCC biotech undergraduates with a greater array of biotechnology research experiences on site, thus expanding the scope and depth of their authentic learning. In addition to on site research, JCC biotechnology students also participate in summer research internships at regional universities. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: <br/>This proposal impacts several hundred high school students by providing training opportunities for area high school teachers and the materials/instruments to develop a more contemporary and biotechnologically-based curriculum at their schools. The effort is also responsive to the recommendations for biology education reform called for in Vision and Change: A Call To Action (NSF/AAAS). The project includes economic impact metrics as a tool for evaluating the effect of the project and uses Tennessee Tech's CAT instrument to capture gains in critical thinking skills."

The scholars are being provided with a variety of quality support structures that emphasizes community building. Included are weekly study sessions to increase student connections with instructors, breakfast orientations, chat rooms, student mentoring, discipline specific one-hour refresher courses, and common enrollment in classes. Students are keeping journals and sharing the information with their advisors and/or the study session instructor, which is providing information about students' needs and the effectiveness of student support activities. The scholars are being supported through an Angel account, a course management software package similar to WebCT or Blackboard, which is fostering inter-group communication, group project work, and communication with the students' mentors. The students are making professional connections through strong connections with local industries, which lie mainly within the manufacturing sector. <br/><br/>The program is targeting women and underrepresented classes of students. Female faculty members in physics, math and computer science are serving as role models. Techniques that are being employed to support and retain women includes hands-on active learning styles in the physics curriculum, forming lab and study groups that respond to gender needs, and providing a family friendly atmosphere in an open lab where students gather to work on problems, eat lunch, or listen to music. A conceptual physics course is being offered to recruit female students to pursue technology or science as a field of study.<br/><br/>"

The UbD approach is synthesized from current learning theory in cognitive psychology and uses a three step, backwards design process. Guidelines established for devising curricula using UbD's backwards design process are being followed to design units for the skeletal and muscular systems. Three local faculty and a science education researcher are serving as peer reviewers of each unit and the action research design plans. The action research studies evaluate student engagement, effects on learning, and administration of a curriculum using UbD. The study triangulates across three types of data (observing, interviewing, and examining documents and other sources) collected at multiple time points, and the study population consists of students enrolled in two anatomy and physiology lecture sections. One of the long-term goals of this project is to develop a network of local, regional, and national human anatomy and physiology educators working in a continuous improvement cycle to ascertain if UbD is effective in improving learning of human anatomy and physiology."
