It is also conducting comprehensive faculty professional development to ensure that teaching meets national standards and students arrive on the job with the skills needed by industry.  <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Information technology is currently responsible for at least 20,000 jobs in Nevada, and that number is expected to grow by 25% in the next 5 years.  By connecting Nevada's students to this tremendous opportunity, this project is directly increasing the state's workforce through improvement of high school and community college education.  The project is providing the statewide coordination for education systems and businesses which are developing a robust and diverse technological education capacity to ensure the workforce is capable of supporting the state's growing IT industry.<br/>"

Five southwestern community colleges - Fullerton College in California, Community College of Southern Nevada in Las Vegas, Nevada, Albuquerque Technical Vocational Institute in New Mexico, City College of San Francisco in California, and Montgomery College in Houston, Texas - have formed the FLASH consortium.  With a combined enrollment of over 131,000, FLASH impacts almost 5000 first-year chemistry students per year.  Because our community colleges admit all applicants, many students are under-prepared, lacking even basic skills in math and writing, and they often cannot succeed in chemistry courses.  These students are clearly ""at risk,"" and steps are needed to help them.  This project is adopting and adapting the methodology of the Molecular Science curriculum project along with relevant materials from this and other projects of the NSF Systemic Changes in the Undergraduate Chemistry Curriculum Initiative.  FLASH believes students may learn better in a technology-mediated, student-centered learning environment in which students are active learners and cooperative learning is supported.  We are setting up Chemistry Learning and Support Studio (CLASS) rooms at our respective colleges to make the actual processs of studying chemistry more engaging and interesting.  The Web-deliverable nature of many of the materials allows use not only in on-campus facilities but anywhere students have access to the Internet.  We assist even the most under-prepared students to become more competitive as undergraduates and, ultimately, in their careers.  This project helps our students and has the potential to serve as a model for every community college."

A Technology Education Alliance advisory board organizes the development of a strategic plan to build upon investments already made by the State of Nevada. The plan pulls together business, economic development, and secondary and postsecondary schools to foster relationships to launch an effective educational system for producing workers highly-qualified for the workforce.  The Alliance increases industry input into higher education programs, coordinating an analysis of core competencies needed for emerging technologies.  Plans are made for academic support services to increase the recruitment and retention of women and other groups underrepresented in technological education."
