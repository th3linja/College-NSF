With large manufacturers such as Tesla and Panasonic Corporation moving into the Reno area, the need for manufacturing technicians has become a dominant issue for ensuring the success of this industry and for the economic development goals of the region. Truckee Meadows Community College (TMCC) has also identified access to online content as a major barrier for students whose work schedules or home location interfere with their participation in traditional, on-campus courses.  are working or who live far from campus. To generate the workforce necessary for the continued prosperity of the region, TMCC will create easy to use, flexible courses that it hopes will appeal to incumbent workers, lower skilled workers, and workers with non-traditional schedules. This approach may enable students who are unable to attend traditional classes to enroll in the courses necessary to complete programs.  In turn, these programs have the potential to provide these students with employability skills, access to a stackable degree program leading toward the completion of an Associate of Applied Science with Production Technician emphasis, and upward mobility.<br/><br/>The goals of the project are to: 1) provide an educated workforce using industry-validated curriculum to meet regional needs; 2) provide students easier access to course material online; and 3) use a scheduling application to reserve lab stations for student use. To achieve these goals, TMCC proposes to: 1) conduct DACUM analyses with industry employees; 2) provide students easier access to course content online using uniform course design and Quality Matters standards; and 3) research and install a lab scheduling application that will allow distant learners to reserve lab stations before commuting to campus. Additionally, TMCC students will have the opportunity to participate in the Tesla and Panasonic Registered Apprenticeship Programs. The project results will be disseminated at regional and national conferences.  In addition, the flexible scheduling model is expected to be adaptable to other industries nationally supporting both traditional students and those incumbent workers seeking upskilling or re-skilling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet integrating scenario-based learning into the community college environment requires change and an understanding of the ways that this pedagogical approach can be adapted to meet the needs of the faculty practitioner. Action research is used to engage faculty, under the guidance of professional researchers, in examining the challenges of implementing SBL instruction in technician education. An online community of practice is developed by establishing a library of SBL resources and by linking to ATE centers and projects, initially in biology and bio-informatics. Three prototype online wizards are developed and tested to support community college instructors in editing existing SBL activities, in creating new SBL activities and in creating principled assessments items using the ideas of evidence-centered design. An advisory board of industry representatives and educational researchers in the fields of teaming, problem based learning and collaborative learning guide the development and validation of the scenarios. The evaluation determines metrics to measure the extent to which the SBLs prove useful to faculty and students in technical education."

New equipment supports the creation of four laboratory exercises. These exercises are designed so that students apply the scientific method using recently developed data collection technology and computer software. The laboratory exercise sequence starts students at a relatively low conceptual level at which learning occurs through manipulating physical objects to observe cause and effect relationships. It concludes with a sampling exercise that involves students with a more intellectually sophisticated level of conceptual and analytical thought. The emphasis placed on intellectual development in this series of laboratory exercises is unique and highly useful in developing scientific literacy. The new equipment introduces scientifically illiterate students to (1) cause and effect relationships in science through the use of a ground water model and computer simulations that allow students to manipulate variables and watch the results, (2) methods of collecting and analyzing data that range from qualitative observations to the use of state-of-the-art environmental sensors and computers, and (3) effective communication of their discoveries and excitement in a written and mathematical form."
