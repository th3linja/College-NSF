This lays the foundation for several follow-on survey research projects, in particular a social ties research proposal, as well as rural-urban migration research, research on urban participation in subsistence harvest and sharing, and social indicators research. <br/><br/>The problem is that no sample frame of Alaska Natives in Anchorage exists. Furthermore, with only 7.7% of the Anchorage population Alaska Native, a standard random household sample is not a cost effective method to locate them. The research pilot tests two complementary methodologies: a random sample of the census tracts and blocks with the greatest concentrations of Alaska Natives, and a quota sample generated through convenience and snowball sampling techniques. In addition to estimating sampling error, key questions in the pilot data are compared to American Community Survey data to assess potential bias. The pilot survey also develops a new survey technology and protocol using hand-held computers; measures the effects of incentives on survey response rates; generates preliminary estimates of ANCSA regional affiliations and migration status for use in future survey research designs; and pre-tests questions for the social ties research."

Under the leadership and guidance of the founding institution, the University of Alaska Anchorage, each of these Alliance Universities has formed a partnership with high schools and industrial participants.  The goal of this project, which builds upon and adds to an existing alliance of six institutions--University of Alaska Anchorage, University of Alaska Fairbanks, University of Hawai?i Manoa, University of Washington, Kapiolani Community College, and Kuskokwim Community College?is to effect a systematic change in the hiring patterns of Indigenous Americans in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by increasing the number of individuals on a career path to leadership in STEM fields.  Basic to the work of each of these teams is the Pre-College portion of the model.  Each team works with high schools and industrial partners in order to establish computer labs in Native communities and/or in schools with substantial indigenous populations.  In the labs, high school students assemble computers, train on specific engineering and science software packages, and teach others how to build computers.  Students are required to successfully complete chemistry, physics, and trigonometry prior to graduation.  Students who meet all of the programmatic requirements earn the right to keep the computer.  The work will advance the knowledge and understanding of key elements that serve to motivate native students and to sustain their interest through successful degree completion.<br/><br/>While the project focuses primarily on the replication of the pre-college model developed at the University of Alaska Anchorage, it will also contribute to the strengthening of the STEM pipeline including summer bridge programs, university retention programs, and graduate education at the participating universities.  The proposed pre-college project has the potential to bring about a substantial increase in the number of Indigenous Americans studying engineering and other STEM fields at the participating universities.  NSF funding will be substantially leveraged by matching funds from participating universities and their industry school system partners. <br/><br/>Partners central to this Indigenous Alliance activity include University of Alaska Anchorage(lead institution), universities: South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, University of Colorado Boulder, University of Idaho, and University of North Dakota; high schools: Lapwai Junior-Senior HS (Nez Perce), Four Winds Community High School; Boulder Valley Schools; Leadership Institute: Boulder Valley Schools;  non-academic organizations: Ford Foundation, Sloan Foundation, 3M, and J.D.

They do not migrate. They do not use torpor or hibernation to conserve energy.   Yet they are the most abundant small mammals in arctic and sub-arctic ecosystems, surviving and reproducing in long, dark, cold and food-limited winters.  There are no data on energy requirements of these animals in winter, no data on seasonal changes in their food quality and only indirect data available on reproduction outside summer.  This project will be a field-based study on a representative species, the northern red-backed vole, Clethrionomys rutilus, in Alaska.  It will substantially improve our knowledge of the mechanisms that underpin winter survival and reproduction in one of the most influential arctic taxa.  Vole and lemming population sizes are of fundamental interest to ecologists working in arctic and sub-arctic ecosystems and this has been a driving force behind the search for the mechanisms that underpin their population cycles.  Ecological work on population cycling has been handicapped by the absence of data on winter survival and reproduction rates.  This project will generate those data and thus improve our ability to predict summer vole populations.  It will help us to better predict the effect on winter reproduction and survival in vole and lemming populations should the current warming trend continue in Alaska. <br/>       The aim of this project is to test the hypothesis that northern red-backed voles change their patterns of energy use and acquisition in winter in a manner that facilitates their survival and that these energetic changes enable a sub-set of the population to reproduce during that period.  Field data on body condition, reproductive state and field metabolic rate will be obtained through the year from free-living voles in the Chugach State Forest, Alaska and correlations between these measurements and environmental parameters will be identified.   Parallel laboratory studies will address what determines reproductive activity in winter.         This project will help to establish a collaborative research network to broaden the related research infrastructure in Alaska.  It represents the first major collaboration between the Alaska Zoo, Anchorage, Alaska, and the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA).  Display material and an educational program are being developed for the zoo to inform the general public about the research as well as on the general biology of Alaskan rodents.  Research is a new focus for the Alaska zoo and its involvement represents a substantial increase in animal research infrastructure for Anchorage. This project will build collaborative links between Alaska's two major universities, the University of Alaska Anchorage and the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and will further the development of graduate research at UAA.  The PhD student associated with this project is jointly enrolled at UAA and UAF and supervised by faculty from each campus. In addition to the PhD student and masters student employed in the project, at least one UAA undergraduate student will participate every summer through the UAA honors program and at least two Alaska Native High School students will do so as part of the Biomedical Department's Della Keats/UD0C program. <br/>"

The program is designed to actively engage undergraduates in faculty-mentored, independent research in the areas of Ecology and Physiological Ecology in South-central Alaska. The opportunities offered by Alaska as a natural laboratory for high latitude ecological studies are unparalleled. The program is intended to positively influence undergraduates toward postgraduate education and careers in the sciences. It is guided by four main objectives: 1) to help students develop critical thinking skills, 2) to increase student interest in pursuing careers in sciences and to engage students directly in discussions surrounding graduate school and career options, 3) to increase student independence as researchers, and 4) to attract a diverse range of students into the program. The program is structured to involve students in all aspects of scientific investigation and inspire them through direct exposure to ecological and physiology phenomena in Alaska. Students are mentored toward increased independence as the program progresses. Weekly research seminars, a series of career development workshops that include a focus on ethics and responsible conduct in research, and a variety of fieldtrips and social activities facilitate student learning and development. The program concludes with a student research symposium. Students from underrepresented minority groups and from institutions with limited opportunities for research are targeted during recruiting efforts. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool.

The instruments will be used to measure the natural abundance of isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen (C-13, N-15, H-2 (deuterium), O-18), in studies involving plants, soils, water, and animals.  The instruments are also capable of measuring samples that have been enriched with these isotopes, in labeling experiments designed to study plant water sources and field metabolic rates of small mammals.  The intellectual merit and the scientific motivation for acquiring this instrumentation package derives from the fact that the Arctic is changing rapidly, and there is a great need for using tools that are integrative in time and space, and tools that can unravel the complexity of linkages between the biosphere-atmosphere and aquatic systems and the intricate nature of food webs.  The instruments will facilitate quantification of the consequences of vegetation change, of shifting patterns in the field metabolic rates of small mammals, of the water sources of vegetation as permafrost melts, quantification of precipitation geochemistry at local to regional scales, and food web ecology of marine mammals.  In addition to the impact on the research productivity of numerous scientists in Alaska, the new instruments will support the emerging needs of NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network) in Alaska, the International Polar Year, and citizen science with the Anchorage Waterways Council.

Most studies of patterns and processes responsible for vegetation change have focused on deciduous shrubs, which have shown increases in abundance throughout much of the Arctic.  Fewer studies have examined changes in tree abundance at the interface between arctic tundra and the boreal forest. This project will take advantage of historical aerial images collected throughout the Brooks Range during the 1950s and 1970s to provide a comprehensive census of changes in tree abundance in recent decades in northern Alaska. Investigators will also test hypotheses about whether differences in nutrition, colder soils, and more widespread permafrost explain why trees in the western Brooks Range have increased their growth in response to recent warming, while those in the eastern Brooks Range have not. In addition, the investigators plan extensive education and outreach activities in rural and urban Alaska. Rural efforts will include visiting classrooms in Kotzebue High School to share research results, providing opportunities for Kotzebue High School students to join the research team in the field, arrainging to be interviewed by local public radio stations, and delivering public lectures at National Park Service headquarters in several local villages. In Anchorage, the investigators plan to equip a public high school in Anchorage with supples needed to conduct tree-ring research, train students in standard methods, and help them design a study to link white spruce tree ring data in their backyards to long term climate records. <br/><br/>The relative abundance of forest and tundra has important implications for surface energy exchange, carbon cycling, wildlife habitat and the availability of subsistence resources at high latitudes. The northern limit of the boreal forest in Alaska is formed within the Brooks Range. The eastern Brooks Range is an area well known to dendrochronologists as an epicenter of divergent tree growth responses to climate warming. Divergence refers to the deterioration of historically strong positive correlations between temperature and tree growth. The recognition that divergence has been widespread in the circumboreal has undermined confidence in paleoclimate reconstructions and created uncertainty in projections of vegetation-climate feedbacks. While divergence is a well-known phenomenon, its implications for changes in tree abundance and shifts in treeline position remain unknown. Recent findings in four watersheds along a west to east gradient in the Brooks Range suggest colder, more permafrost-affected soils limit tree access to soil nutrients and may be the cause of divergence in the eastern Brooks Range.  In this study, investigators will expand the spatial extent of this previous work to examine the causes and consequences of divergence in the Brooks Range. They will combine repeat aerial photography with tree-ring analysis and detailed measurements of tree microclimates, mycorrhizal associations, nutrient relations, and reproductive effort in 25 Brooks Range watersheds to yield broad-scale mechanistic insights into controls on tree growth and changes in tree abundance in a changing climate. They will test the hypothesis that positive growth responses to warming and increased tree abundance will prevail in the western Brooks Range and in habitats with warmer soils, while neutral growth responses to warming and stagnant treelines will be common in the eastern Brooks Range and in areas with cold soils.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, the pass rates for this course are consistently low.  To improve student success, this project will redesign the course to include interactive practices such as instant responses, one-minute discussions and writing assignments, and rubrics to grade presentations by fellow students.  Introduction of similar activities into an introductory course for biology majors improved the pass rates from 46% to 87%.  Project personnel will identify what elements of the majors' course are particularly successful and will use that information, along with a survey of best practices in biology education, to revamp the curriculum for the general education course.  UAA serves a diverse student population often underrepresented in STEM fields, including 81% who receive need-based financial aid.  The project is designed to investigate what aspects of the new course will resonate most strongly with the diverse student population at UAA.  Faculty at UAA will participate in workshops to improve their teaching and faculty incentives will promote implementation of best teaching practices.  The planned course revisions are designed to increase course completion, increase science literacy, and improve quantitative reasoning skills.  Additionally, it is envisioned that the revisions will encourage more students to pursue STEM majors and careers, helping to fill a national need for increasing the STEM workforce.  Finally, approximately 7% of the students enrolled in the general education course are training to be K-12 teachers.  Improving their college biology experience may have positive impacts on their future classrooms.<br/><br/>This project will use a mixed methods approach to identify and quantify course elements that increase course completion, retention, science literacy, and quantitative reasoning in a diverse student body.  Quantitative analysis will include a difference in differences (DiD) approach to mimic an experimental design and to isolate the impact of the intervention.  The impact will be measured as changes in pre- and post-intervention scores for the treatment group (students who participate in the redesigned curriculum) and control group (students who took the course prior to the redesign).  Literature relating to active learning strategies in STEM considers learning gains in a single setting that is already using active learning.  This project incorporates a quasi-experimental DiD design using a large dataset and diverse student body with a range of academic and demographic characteristics and has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.  A qualitative analysis will supplement and add depth to the quantitative findings; axial coding of focus group interviews with majors, non-majors in the traditional course, and non-majors in the revised course will be analyzed using within-case analysis of each group.  Comparative analysis with pattern matching will be used for a cross-case analysis to identify commonalities and differences between the groups.  In addition to these empirical contributions, the analysis will support curriculum design, faculty development, and course assessment for the general education biology course.  Professional development and faculty incentives have the potential to enhance teaching and learning throughout the courses offered by the Department of Biological Sciences and ensure implementation fidelity to the best practice pedagogical approaches.  The findings of this project are expected to be especially informative for commuter colleges and other open-enrollment institutions with diverse student bodies, including indigenous student populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Perry, Donald E. Spallinger and Jeffrey M. Welker from the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA) Campus will acquire high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer (LC/MS/MS). Mass spectrometry provides powerful compound identification and quantification based on the masses of various fragments as well as for determining the molecular weight of the components of complex mixtures such as lipids, persistent organic pollutants, and tannins which are currently research topics of UAA faculty and students. Furthermore, the mass spectrometer will be combined with an ion chromatograph (IC) to separate anions, such as toxic perchlorate at low concentration in complex matrixes, which is another active research topic at UAA. The spectrometer is ideal because it provides different modes of ionization with a sensitivity of 250 femtograms over a wide mass range (m/z 50-2200). The instrument will be hosted in the Applied Science, Engineering, and Technology (ASET) Laboratory at UAA where a laboratory manager and chemist will provide the knowledge and skills needed to establish methods, maintain the performance of this instrument, and train faculty and students.<br/><br/>Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules.  It is one of the fastest growing and most widely used analytical instrumentation techniques.  Because of this, it is important for undergraduate and master students to be exposed to the technique. To a first approximation a tandem mass spectrometer can be thought of as two mass spectrometers in series connected by a chamber that can break a molecule into pieces."

These motions are not only interesting by themselves, but also important for the many functions of proteins. This project focuses on the hydrophobic core, which is the part of the protein that is hidden away from water. To get a detailed picture of motions inside the core, selected hydrogen atoms will be changed to deuterons, which have identical chemical properties but different magnetic ones. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy will then be used to follow the motions at the selected sites. The investigation will probe the dependence of the motions on temperature and amount of water around the protein molecule to reveal the characteristics of the potential energy. By focusing on quantitative investigations of fluctuations in the core region of proteins, this project will contribute toward elucidation of physical factors that govern protein dynamics.<br/><br/>This project has the broader purpose of exposing undergraduate students at the University of Alaska at Anchorage, which is a predominantly undergraduate institution, to state-of-the-art instrumentation that is not available to them in the Anchorage area. The interdisciplinary nature of the work, spanning chemistry, biology, physics, mathematics, and computer science, allows for the appreciation of multiple approaches to solving contemporary scientific problems, as well as for the incorporation of students from various disciplines into the project The University of Alaska has a large percentage of students from underrepresented groups, such as Alaska Natives, and special effort will be made to attract this group of students through an already established connection with the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program."

The EarthScope Alaska Native Geoscience Learning Experience (EarthScope ANGLE) aims to increase Alaskan resilience to geohazards through education and building of an action oriented statewide learning community that connects formal and informal educators, emergency management personnel, scientists, students, community elders and other organizations in rural villages. The great earthquakes and tsunamis that devastated Sumatra on December 26, 2004, Chile on February 27, 2010 and Japan on March 11, 2011 have heightened public concern about similar geologic hazards in our own country. As part of a nationwide effort to study earthquakes and the Earth's crust, the NSF EarthScope Program has been deploying hundreds of seismic, GPS, and other geophysical instruments across the United States. Recently deployed in Alaska, these instruments provide detail for ongoing research showing that coastal regions are storing energy that will be released in great earthquakes, with resulting tsunamis that may impact the entire west coast of the US and Hawaii. Thousands of Alaskan residents live within severe earthquake-shaking and tsunami-inundation zones, and millions of tourists visit state and federal parks in these same areas each year. Teachers in the K-12 school systems convey some basics about geological hazards to their students, and park rangers and museum educators likewise engage visitors at their sites. Both of these groups also at times work with emergency managers. ANGLE is strengthening these efforts by providing community-based workshops that bring together all of these professionals to review the basic science of earthquakes and tsunamis, learn about EarthScope and other research efforts that monitor the dynamic Earth in the region, and develop ways to collectively engage students and the general public on the mitigation of coastal geologic hazards.<br/><br/>The ANGLE project is a collaborative effort among geoscience educators from Alaska Pacific University and Central Washington University with the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program (ANSEP) at the University of Alaska Anchorage. From 2017-2020, four Educator Professional Development workshops and eight ANSEP academies for Alaska Native students will be conducted. Through these workshops and academies, ANGLE establishes a statewide network of stakeholders that includes students, teachers and Native Elders from rural Alaska Native villages, some of Alaska's most vulnerable communities. The emphasis on educators and Native students will ensure that a wide variety of learners will be reached, either directly or by later contact with ANGLE participants. A synthesis of existing EarthScope educational materials and methods, translated to an Alaskan setting, will form the core of the programming. Drawing from methods of previous EarthScope education projects, ANGLE will incorporate best practices including societal relevance of science, data collection and analysis, nature of science, learning community development, current science standards, and place-based and cultural knowledge. Participating educators will learn about ongoing research on Alaskan tectonics, earthquakes and tsunamis, and about how EarthScope is advancing frontiers of knowledge about geologic hazards in the region. Emergency management outreach leaders will contribute to discussions on emergency preparedness actions. Master teachers offer pedagogical guidance and ideas about assessment and interaction, while experienced interpreters discuss how to reach a variety of audiences in settings outside the classroom. In follow-up share-a-thons, the teachers and interpreters showcase how they have crafted their new knowledge into Earth science and emergency preparedness learning experiences for K-12 students and visitors to parks and museums. Ultimately thousands of learners in various settings will be reached. The final ANGLE-synthesized collection of EarthScope resources will be hosted on the well-known Science Education Resource Center website (>5 million visitors/year) and reviewed by the National Association of Geoscience Teachers insuring high profile access to the resources for years to come."

The project is based on an emerging successful broadening participant program that aims to increase the representation of Alaska Natives in engineering. The Alaska Native Science & Engineering Program (ANSEP) is comprehensive model program that currently works with 2,000 students. A quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the program was completed in 2015 by the Urban Institute. They found that the ANSEP model offers important lessons for other science, technology, engineering and mathematics education programs for underrepresented minorities, especially in its engagement of students from middle school through graduate school. Alaska has one of the most expensive K12 education systems in the nation and consistently ranks at the bottom for performance at all levels. Many of the conditions and student outcomes are similar to those found in under-served communities across the nation including inner cities, the Mississippi Delta, rural America, Appalachia, and Indian reservations. ANSEP has catalyzed a change in the educational paradigm and established a comprehensive set of components that extend from 6th grade to graduate school. The aim is effecting systemic change to improve the recruitment, progression, and advancement of Alaska Natives in the engineering workforce. The program has leveraged NSF support to sustain and institutionalize the various programmatic components through partnerships with more than 100 industrial firms, philanthropic organizations, federal and state agencies, schools, colleges, and universities who provide resources, advocacy, research opportunities, and internships. <br/><br/>Seven teams from a variety of institutional types will be selected to participate in the dissemination conference. Teams will include a cross-section of higher education, secondary school, industry and philanthropic partners. Participants will be solicited from targeted institutions where a replication of the work will have the greatest impact and highest likelihood of success. The conference is designed to be hands-on and experiential. Teams will learn from panels of ANSEP partners, students, and alumni, and will participate in and observe activities associated with the ANSEP programmatic components. Each team will develop a customized program based on the nuances of their local contexts."

It is intended to encourage undergraduates toward postgraduate education and careers in the sciences. It is guided by four main objectives: 1) to help students develop critical thinking skills, 2) to increase student interest in pursuing careers in sciences and to engage students directly in discussions surrounding graduate school and career options, 3) to increase student independence as researchers, and 4) to attract a diverse range of students into the program. The program is structured to involve students in all aspects of scientific investigation and to inspire them through direct exposure to ecological and physiological phenomena in Alaska. Students are mentored toward increased independence as the program progresses. Weekly research seminars, a series of career development workshops, and a variety of fieldtrips and group activities facilitate student learning and development. Focused discussions and training in ethics and responsible conduct of research are included in the program's format. The program concludes with a student research symposium in which students are expected to present the results of their projects to student peers, colleagues, and mentors. Students from underrepresented minority groups and from institutions with limited opportunities for research are targeted during recruiting efforts. A combination of assessment tools, including exit surveys, mentor evaluations, student tracking, and program tracking, are used to measure the effectiveness of this program.

Two particularly strong research focus groups have emerged in this department: Systematics & Ecology and Cell Biology & Physiology. A critical need for research-grade light microscopic instrumentation now exists in each of these core groups. The current need for this instrumentation has been fueled by recent departmental growth but extends beyond the level of individual researchers to the  inter-departmental and institutional levels as well. UAA is striving to integrate research and educational activities from different fields of science. Central to this mission is having appropriate instrumentation in place that will permit collaborative efforts between faculty working in different disciplines and enhance opportunities for student involvement in research activities.  <br/><br/>Independent research by faculty is one of the primary drivers for engaging the interest of students in science classes. A suite of research-grade light microscopic instrumentation will not only strengthen independent research by faculty in this department, it will provide a set of tools for directly involving undergraduate students in faculty supervised research. This use falls in line with UAA's mission to achieve excellence in scientific education through developing new ways to engage students in the process of learning. The geographical position of UAA places it in a prime location to broaden the participation of underrepresented students, such Alaskan Natives, in these processes.

The use of the jet-environment interaction as the framework to explore jet physics is novel, and is an especially fruitful approach to some of the most basic and refractory problems involving jets that have remained unsolved for over thirty years.  Because the radiative signatures of this interaction can span many orders of magnitude in energy, the conference will present and discuss X-ray, optical, infrared and radio data.  In addition, cosmogonic models show an increasing need for energy feedback during the early epoch of galaxy formation, which is likely to be coming from active galactic nuclei, and thus probably jet-related.  The emphasis at this meeting is thus relevant to understanding the fundamental parameters of jets themselves, and to current research on galaxy formation and evolution.<br/><br/>A major goal of the workshop is to enhance communication and to further collaboration.  Ample time for discussions is scheduled between and around talks.  Publication of the proceedings will help to ensure that progress made at the meeting will have the greatest long-term impact on the participants' research, and that this influence can spread beyond the attendees themselves.  There will also be an important impact on the University of Alaska Anchorage, the primary local host for the meeting, which is working to enhance its visibility in scientific research and to encourage more Alaskan students to stay within the state for their higher education."

This 6-week summer course in the Subarctic and Arctic environments of Alaska uses three two-week modules focusing on coastal, boreal, and tundra ecosystems in sites such as Prince William Sound, the Chugach Mountains, and Denali National Park. The Field School is generating new excitement about interdisciplinary, hands-on science and is promoting ongoing faculty teamwork and collaboration across science disciplines and departments. The lessons learned from the adaptation project are being disseminated over the internet and through the Project Kaleidoscope network. <br/><br/>Adapting the Columbia Earth Systems Field School provides an exemplary, proven model of interdisciplinary, inquiry-based learning. This model teaches students to understand landscapes in an integrated fashion, by using the disciplines of ecology and geology together and witnessing their dependence on each other. Students build their own conceptual and numerical models of ecosystem processes by collecting field data and using it to test models. They are learning techniques for mapping, identification, description, and analysis, all within the context of understanding current environmental problems. <br/><br/>The conceptual framework of the Earth Systems Field School is being piloted the summer of 2001. The full six-week program is being offered in summer 2002. The program builds on existing course offerings, research programs, and community partnerships. In addition to transporting the curriculum from desert to taiga, the project is vigorously adapting the curriculum to better serve K-12 teacher candidates (and non-science majors generally) and equipping them with transferable science literacy and science enthusiasm. The program is also being restructured to increase its accessibility to older students who make up a large proportion of the University of Alaska's student body and to Alaska Natives who are underrepresented in the preK-12 and liberal arts student populations. <br/><br/>"

Studies have established the limiting process on isolated vortex ring formation from a starting jet, and associated optimal ring formation with the limiting formation time. Inspired by animals such as squids and medusae, a novel propulsion technique has been developed utilizing consecutive vortex rings generated from a pulsed jet. The ring formation process of a pulsed jet is significantly different than that of a starting jet because when rings are generated in a repeated fashion, the interaction between rings alters the dynamics of jet shear layer and vortex formation. This is demonstrated in a recent study in which the limiting formation time is reduced significantly when a pulsed jet generates consecutive vortex rings in close proximity. The formation time alone is not sufficient to describe the ring formation process and the pulsing frequency also plays a significant role. To fully exploit the potential of pulsed-jet propulsion, it is imperative to investigate the influence of vortex interaction on ring formation and establish the limiting ring formation process and its optimization for a pulsed jet.  In this proposed project, experimental studies will be performed to investigate the formation process of consecutive vortex rings from a pulsed jet and to determine the effects of ring interaction on the shear layer dynamics and ring formation process. The research will emphasize vortex ring growth and its limit, as a dynamical systems analysis will be used to quantify entrainment and identify pinch-off. The dependency of the limiting formation time on the pulsing frequency will be established. Thrust generated from a pulsed jet will be quantified and correlated with ring formation dynamics. A theoretical model will then be developed to predict ring pinch-off and to explain the empirical results. A numerical framework will also be developed to optimize the kinematics of the pulsed jet for vortex ring formation and propulsion. Many features of biological systems that act as constraints in optimal ring formation will also be explored, including stopping vortices formed during recovery strokes, time-dependent jet velocity profile, periodic variation in propulsion velocity, etc.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed project will advance the understanding of vortex ring formation from a pulsed jet, and elucidate the effects of vortex interaction on jet shear layer dynamics and ring formation. It will establish the limiting ring growth process for a pulsed jet, as well as its optimization for propulsion. The knowledge obtained in the project will serve as the guideline for applications of pulsed-jet propulsion, a promising design for future aerial/underwater vehicles. In addition, the understanding on various constraints in optimal ring formation inherent in biological systems, as well as on their adaptations to these constraints, will not only contribute insights to the fields of biological locomotion and integrated biological systems but also complement existing design principles of engineering propulsion systems.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project will explore many fundamental fluid dynamics questions regarding vortex ring formation and interaction. It will have potentially wide applications in the emerging field of pulsed-jet propulsion and will further advance this novel propulsion technique. The proposed project will allow education and training for both undergraduate and graduate students. The PI will develop a new lab component (flow visualization and measurement) for the Fluid Mechanics Lab course at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The experimental equipment used in the project will be utilized for students practice in this course, and also as demonstration in another course, Propulsion. The proposed research will also be translated into new educational curricula that are accessible to future generations of engineers and biologists alike. The PI will develop a new multi-disciplinary course, Biomechanics and Bio-inspired Design, for the Mechanical Engineering and Biology curriculum at UAF.  Most Alaska students, especially Alaska Native students, love nature and this proposed course would appeal to many of them and generate interest in engineering disciplines. The project will also serve K-12 students from the State of Alaska through outreach programs such as Alaska Summer Research Academy and Alaska Native Science & Engineering Program. These opportunities for training and mentorship will be directed toward the underrepresented Alaska Native students."

Recent reintroduction of some species allows for an examination of their role in the ecosystem, potential for conflict with humans, and possible strategies for future coexistence of humans and predators. This project will use sea otters in Southeast Alaska as a model system, combining ecology, economics, and Alaskan Native traditional knowledge to learn more about the role of marine predators in coastal sustainability. Between the mid-1700s and 1900, sea otters were hunted to extinction in Southeast Alaska for their highly valuable fur. In the 1960s, these animals were reintroduced in the region, and their population has grown from roughly 400 to more than 25,000 individuals. The recovery of sea otters in Southeast Alaska provides an opportunity to understand their ecological role in coastal ecosystems, while simultaneously evaluating their interactions with people who depend on coastal resources for their livelihood. Because otters eat shellfish, fishermen and people who harvest shellfish have growing concerns that the increase in sea otters is affecting their livelihood and food resources. At the same time, hunting pressure on sea otters has intensified from coastal Alaskan Natives who can legally harvest sea otters for their fur. The project will involve collaboration with Alaska Native communities and elders. In addition, it will support a team of scientists that includes undergraduate researchers, graduate students, two postdoctoral scholars, and two junior faculty members. One of the graduate students is from a group underrepresented in science, and the investigators plan to build on their track record of recruiting and retaining students from programs for Alaskan Natives. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to document the role of apex predators and environmental drivers on changes in nearshore marine resources, ecosystems, and humans using an interdisciplinary approach that integrates ecological studies, traditional knowledge interviews, and ecosystem services quantification and valuation. This research examines changes in the marine environment over a period of time in which sea otters were extinct and then recolonized. The absence and then expansion of sea otters into different areas over time allows for a space-for-time substitution in which the longer-term effects of sea otters can be seen in areas occupied longer. Analyses of historical data provide an opportunity to describe changes in kelp distribution and abundance and subsistence harvests over the last 30-100 years. Quantification and valuation of ecosystem services from sea otters, including seagrass, kelp, and fish, will provide information on the potential benefits of sea otter recolonization. The integration of ecological, anthropological and economic approaches will lead to a better understanding of the reciprocal feedbacks between humans, apex predators and environmental drivers. Collaborations with Alaska Native communities throughout the project include consultation with community members and tribal elders about project goals and results, with the ultimate goal of informing resource management to improve the sustainability of rural coastal communities and nearshore ecosystems."

The project's long-term goal is to fill needs in Alaska's skilled technical workforce by providing Alaskan high school students with introductory courses in software engineering.  To accomplish this goal, this project will prepare teachers in underserved Alaska high schools to teach dual-enrollment courses in the software engineering fields of commercial web design and mobile application development.  The courses will use a cooperative model of instruction that combines the content expertise of college faculty with the teaching expertise of certified high school teachers. The courses will meet all five of the Alaska state technology standards, and thus be relevant for high school graduation as well as college credit. This project has the potential to enable more school districts to offer dual enrollment STEM courses. The cooperative teaching model has national significance because it could be used by any state to meet STEM educational needs in underserved rural areas. This project also has the benefit of opening multiple career pathways that currently do not exist for many high school students in Alaska. The project focuses on partnering with rural Alaskan school districts, where students are more likely to be Alaska Natives, and to come from low income families. It is predicted that completing these dual enrollment courses can increase the competitiveness of rural Alaskan students for local, high-skill software technology jobs, helping to close the rural Alaska skills gap in technology.  <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase the technological competence of teachers and students in all high schools in Alaska. The immediate goal is to partner with high school teachers from multiple school districts to provide coursework for high school students and prepare students for entry-level work as highly-skilled software technologists. Participating high school teachers will first complete college coursework in a specific software engineering topic, to build their content knowledge, skills, and confidence. Each teacher will then teach a dual enrollment course at their high school. A college faculty member will support the teacher, providing oversight and assessment of student outcomes for these courses. This partnership has the potential to create new, high-quality learning experiences for high school students taking dual enrollment information technology courses. The project expects that these courses will provide a pathway to eventual completion of a certificate or associate, bachelor, or graduate degree in software engineering and related fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to be able to predict treeline movements in response to global changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations (and the consequences of these movements in turn on global change), it is essential to understand the most important environmental factors and plant processes presently limiting tree species performance at treelines.<br/>  <br/>White spruce is the dominant treeline tree species in Alaska. Its growth, reproductive effort, and reproductive success is lowered at the treeline as compared to the adjacent forest. In spite of dramatically reduced soil nitrogen mineralization at the treeline as compared to the forest below in the Chugach Mountains, south-central Alaska, nitrogen fertilizer application stimulates white spruce growth only to a small degree, and the effect is no greater at the treeline than inside the forest. Thus it appears that white spruce is not differentially nitrogen limited at the treeline. Rather the treeline white spruce appears to be carbon limited based on current findings of less growth, greater premature needle mortality, reduced mycorrhizal infection levels, and increased root respiration. The PIs for this project predict increased root mortality at the treeline, which they suggest exacerbate the carbon drain by premature needle loss. They expect that increased wind, low soil temperatures, and greater soil movement cause the increase in observed and predicted tissue turnover.  In this project they will evaluate an alternate material limitation reducing growth, i.e. nutrient limitation, possibly a phosphorus deficiency at the Chugach treeline and phosphorus and/or a nitrogen deficiency elsewhere. Supporting a nutrient limitation are trends of increased needle retention along an elevational gradient within the forest, high nutrient concentrations in treeline needles and fine roots, and an elevationally increasing soil nitrogen limitation in treeline mountain birch in Scandinavia. <br/><br/>This project will test the nutrient limitation hypothesis by studying geographically distinct arctic and alpine white spruce treelines and adjacent forest sites in Alaska. The proposed sites have been selected to represent climatic and geographical extremes. At each location the project will study three treeline sites and three forest sites at which vegetation composition, past tree growth, and accumulated needle loss will be measured. At each site seedlings will be planted with and without shelter and with and without fertilizer application. Tree and seedling growth, needle and fine root turnover, tree seed production, seed germination, and seedling establishment will be monitored at each site.  Climatic and soil nutrient conditions will also be monitored at each site. The microclimatic study will indicate the relative importance of different climatic parameters on tissue loss and tissue growth. <br/> <br/>In order to evaluate whether rising atmospheric CO2 concentration will allow the white spruce seedlings to compensate for tissue loss they suffer at the treeline, they will be exposed to different atmospheric CO2 levels (ambient and 1.5 times) and different degree of needle and/or root pruning (intact and 30% removal).  By including two nutrient levels (treeline soil with or without fertilizer) to the treatments, it will be possible to further refine the carbon versus nutrient assessment.  Shoot and root growth will be measured as well as photosynthesis and water relations. Soils and tissues of trees and seedlings from the field and the growth chamber will be sampled for chemical analysis (roots for mycorrhizal infection levels also) in order to test the hypothetical growth reduction mechanisms. <br/><br/>Together, the field and laboratory studies will allow an evaluation of the importance of premature tissue turnover and material limitation on tree performance. That knowledge, in conjunction with an understanding of the relationship between tree species growth and reproductive effort and success, will lay the foundation for a realistic prediction of treeline response to global change.<br/>"

However, scientists, policy makers, and communities have little understanding of the sociocultural effects of  MWS. This research project asks ""Does the presence or absence of MWS affect the social values of water?"" Focusing the research on the role that MWS may play in affecting the values, perceptions and knowledge of water in the Russian Far East and Western Alaska communities, the investigators will provide insights into community resilience and vulnerability with rapidly changing social and natural environments. <br/><br/>The research team will be gathering data in the Chukotka region of Eastern Russia and the Seward Peninsula, Western Alaska.  These two regions share similar biophysical, geographical, and subsistence characteristics but contain different cultural groups.  Communities in both regions share similar challenges in acquiring water for domestic and industrial uses and are experiencing rapid transformations due to large-scale resource extraction. These cross-cultural comparisons will aid the research team in understanding whether MWS reduce the adaptive capacity to manage water resources. The objective of the research project is to understand whether or not MWS affect longer term resilience of a community by decreasing the familiarity of the users in these communities with their hydrological landscapes through a process of ""distancing"", a phenomenon the investigators have observed in previous work. <br/><br/>The interdisciplinary approach of the project uses information provided by residents about their values, perceptions, and knowledge of the water they rely on.  In addition, the research integrates this knowledge into a new, composite tool to assess their overall resilience called the Arctic Water Resources Vulnerability Index (AWRVI).  Since almost no social data or ethnography of water exist for the Arctic, the data collected will be a stand-alone, novel contribution to the limited analyses that exist of human-freshwater interactions. In addition, community members will be trained in the use of AWRVI and provided with the tool for their use beyond the conclusion of this project. The application of AWRVI in each community will serve as a baseline that communities may refer to in order to measure changes in their resilience over time, under diverse scenarios. In addition, this work will provide new insight into how communities who have had MWS and lost them are adapting.  Ultimately, the research will help not only Arctic communities, but many developing communities worldwide to assess the trade-offs of MWS and whether or not the benefits that are provided by water treatment/supply technologies should be balanced against cultural changes in the short and long term."

Each year a total of 8 students will be selected to participate in a 10-week summer program. The opportunities offered by Alaska as a natural laboratory for high latitude ecological studies are unparalleled. The program is intended to positively influence undergraduates toward postgraduate education and careers in the sciences. It will be guided by four main objectives: 1) to help students develop critical thinking skills, 2) to increase student interest in pursuing careers in sciences and to engage students directly in discussions surrounding graduate school and career options, 3) to increase student independence as researchers, and 4) to attract a diverse range of students into the program. The program will be structured to involve students in all aspects of scientific investigation and inspire them through direct exposure to ecological and physiology phenomena in Alaska. Weekly research seminars, a series of career development workshops, and a variety of fieldtrips and social activities will facilitate student learning and development. The program will conclude with a research symposium where the results of student independent projects will be presented to student peers, colleagues and mentors.

In many Alaskan rural communities, whose primary population is Alaska Native people, the elderly are still relied upon for their deep knowledge and understanding of the natural environment, heritage languages, and cultural practices which are important not only for economic survival but social cohesion and community wellbeing.  However, change is deeply affecting Alaska Native communities and Alaska Native people are forced to adapt to the new environmental, economic and social realities that affect their worlds.  This research project will explore how Alaska Native elderly are adapting to rapid economic, environmental, and social change by exploring Alaska Native elderly and their own understanding and definition of what successful aging means to them.  <br/><br/>The current research project will establish a better understanding of successful aging from the perspectives of Alaska Native elderly in Northwest Alaska. Being the Principal Investigators second research project on this topic, this project has the potential to inform future studies of indigenous successful aging, studies that allow the elderly themselves to subjectively define for themselves what it means to age well.  In the spirit of community-based participatory research, several communities in Northwest Alaska reached out to the principal investigator, Dr. Jordan P. Lewis (Aleut, Native Village of Naknek), to request that similar research be conducted in their region.  They did so after learning of his ""Successful Aging Study,"" which was carried out in Bristol Bay Alaska from 2011-2014 and brought awareness of the value of positive, or generative, focused research with the elderly, highlighting their lessons and knowledge for healthy aging. <br/><br/>This research study will consist of 60 qualitative in-depth interviews with Alaska Native elderly to establish an indigenous understanding of what successful aging means for Alaska Natives in Northwest Alaska and what is required to age in place.  Interviews will be conducted with Alaska Native elderly and their family members in their own homes in five participating communities, as well as those who have relocated to the Quyanna Care facility in Nome, Alaska. Through these interviews the research team will to explore the concept of successful aging and hope to gain a sense of Alaska Native beliefs about aging, what is required to age in place? and how relocation to facilities for the elderly impacts views of successful aging?  In the spirit of Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR), participants will be engaged through the entire research process, from conception to data analysis. Meetings will be held in participating communities to review the findings and receive feedback; this will ensure the findings reflect the unique perspectives of the Elders, families, communities, and region. These findings will also be compared with the previous study on successful aging conducted in Bristol Bay to compare and contrast experiences of aging in these two rural regions of Alaska. This study will also explore what is required to age in place to reduce or eliminate the need for the elderly to relocate - taking with them the language, culture, and history of the community.  Previous research by the PI has shown that enabling older Alaskan Native people to remain in their homes and communities contributes to the health and wellbeing of the communities. The research will shed additional light on what it means to age well in rural Alaska and determine what role their community plays in how Alaska Native people subjectively define their aging process.  <br/><br/>The significance of this proposed research advances discovery through the establishment of a locally and culturally informed, Alaska Native, understanding of successful aging that builds on the PI's previous projects. In addition to contributing to the academic literature on successful aging, it promotes teaching and learning from the Elders on healthy aging in rural Alaska.  It also educates researchers on the importance of CBPR and allowing the elderly to subjectively define their aging process, as well as engaging the local community throughout the entire research process, which promotes the coproduction of knowledge and bi-directional learning. This research project broadens the participation of underrepresented groups (Alaska Natives) and puts them on equal footing with the scientists in interpreting results and in presenting the results.  This research also has the potential to contribute to the disciplines of anthropology, gerontology, community psychology, sociology, and others by paving the way for future researchers interested in indigenous aging.  <br/><br/>The research findings can influence health and social policy in Alaska and how healthcare and long-term support services are delivered to older residents in rural communities. The results of this research will be published and be disseminated for other researchers, gerontologists, anthropologists, and students to use with the permission of the tribal governing authorities, the Alaska Native participants and their  communities. This study will also highlight that aging does not have to equal poor health and immobility; aging well should be a right that can be attained by everyone.   This research has the potential to inform health professionals, policy advocates, local and state officials about the factors that determine whether or not rural Alaska communities are able to meet the needs of their elderly and enable them to live their remaining years as they may wish."

The Census Long Form Survey historically provided much of the data for measuring social and economic conditions in the U.S. Its replacement with the American Community Survey (ACS) after the 2000 Census has raised serious concerns about whether Census data continue to provide accurate measures of well-being in rural Alaska communities, at a time when the region faces unprecedented environmental and socio-economic change. The project addresses the uncertainty with ACS data by developing a new set of social, economic, and cultural indicators with increased capability to detect differences at local scales.<br/><br/>Specific objectives include: (1) systematically examine the reliability of ACS data for rural Alaska by disaggregating published margins of error into components expressing dispersion across communities, years, and individuals; (2) construct socio-economic indicators for rural Alaska communities and regions with substantially smaller margins of error than published results; (3) estimate key indicators for communities where observations are sparse or missing entirely; and (4) test whether communities and regions have changed or differ significantly with respect to one or more indicators. The project pursues these objectives through modeling and statistical analyses of multiple primary data sources, including individual interview data from the ACS and the previous censuses in cooperation with the U.S. Census Bureau. Project outputs include a set of socio-economic indicators with improved reliability over published ACS figures that can help state and local governments and non-governmental organizations allocate funds, plan, and evaluate social service and economic development programs. A pioneering application of data assimilation with a social system model aids arctic social observing system design by revealing highest priority targets for new data collection for observing and understanding social change in arctic communities."

The project encourages students and their communities to envision how unmanned aerial systems (UAS) can be used to address local priorities, such as wildlife management, search and rescue operations, and monitoring of hazards. In this context, the project will develop, implement, and test a place-based education strategy that includes a teacher professional development course, three culturally inclusive curriculum units focusing on STEM fields, and UAS-focused career exploration experiences. The project aims to increase Alaska Native students' enthusiasm, engagement, and success in STEM education. <br/><br/>This mixed-methods comparative case study responds to three identified problems within the schools and communities participating in the project.  These include: 1) a lack of culturally relevant curriculum and educational resources, 2)inexperienced educators who are unprepared for rural Alaska settings; and 3)limited opportunities for local STEM mentorship and STEM workforce learning opportunities. In this context, the overarching goal of the project is to increase Alaska Native students' enthusiasm, engagement, and success in STEM learning. The associated research goal is to identify key factors and strategies that engender this success in STEM subjects. To achieve these goals, the project aims to: 1) engage students and communities in identifying locally relevant UAS applications; 2) develop science and technology curricula related to place-based UAS applications; 3) develop a distance-delivered continuing education course for upper-elementary teachers; 4)train up to 23 elementary school teachers to instruct science and technology using place-based pedagogies; and 5)deliver the DRONES curricula and an associated year-end career exploration experience to three school districts serving a total of 450 4th through 6th grade students in 14 rural Alaska communities. A backwards design process will be used for curriculum development to ensure that project deliverables address targeted Alaska cultural standards, Next Generation Science Standards, Alaska science standards, and 21st Century Competencies.

The project will address four overarching interrelated goals: 1) reconstruction of climate fluctuations over the past two millennia with linkages to whale species and their numbers; 2) determination of native whale selection by species and size through the study of archeological whale bones, recently landed whales, and whale stock characteristics; 3) study of sociocultural variability of whaling and community organization; and 4) a focused examination of relations between prehistoric Siberian and Alaskan whale hunting groups around the Bering Strait.  This research takes into account the endangered nature of whales, threatened and damaged archeological sites, and elderly native whalers who have the greatest long-term knowledge about historic whaling.  Bowhead whales are federally protected due to their limited numbers, coastal archeological sites that contain whale bones and whale hunting technology are eroding at a rapid rate, and Eskimo elders often die of old age without having an opportunity to record their firsthand and long-term acquaintance with whaling and its social dimensions."

Historically the village was a primary socioeconomic center in northwest Alaska.  Wales people engaged in trade and warfare with Asiatic Eskimos; these activities may have drawn the large Wales population to the location.  This circumstance provides perhaps the best opportunity in western Alaska to examine the possibility of social ranking in late prehistoric Eskimo society.  The results of this analysis will therefore pertain directly to sociopolitical and socioterritorial studies of hunter-gatherer groups worldwide, and they will contribute substantially to increased understanding of developing complexity in egalitarian societies as they are transformed into formally ranked social groups such as those that have been documented in the Northwest Coast culture area. Analyses of trait distributions will also examine relations between the late prehistoric Eskimo manifestations at three sites in the Wales locality.  The sites contain faunal remains, which can illuminate the context in which the prehistoric human predation of whales was carried out against the background of simultaneous exploitation of various non-cetacean marine and terrestrial fauna.  Preliminary findings indicate that non-cetacean sea mammals played a much larger role in the economy of Wales than has been suggested previously, and they raise a number of questions concerning the carrying capacity of the local resources in relation to the exceedingly large number of human inhabitants of the locality.  Further development of the faunal database and accompanying analysis will illuminate how the large, concentrated population used local resources.  The results will contribute to an increased precision in interpretations of the role of mega-fauna in prehistoric Pleistocene and Holocene human subsistence economies.     <br/><br/>"

These new, state-of-the-art eye trackers will replace two lower quality eye trackers, freeing one up for student use. The eye trackers will be located in a controlled-access, public use laboratory available to several researchers at the University of Alaska at Anchorage. <br/>The enhanced capabilities of the new eye trackers will permit greater range of motion for more natural user interaction and higher accuracy for better biometrics. Consequently, the work will permit transformational research into more natural and transparent user authentication and computer security based on a comprehensive set of biomarkers, assistive research into mathematical learning techniques for persons with disabilities, enhanced, biomarker-based intelligent search and document categorization through online user profiling, and enhanced assessment of learning efficacy. Aside from brain activity, eye patterns are one of the most direct windows into a person?s understanding and mental activity. <br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The broader impacts include the involvement of 4-6 undergraduate students per year in eye tracking research by the co-PIs, with possibly another 4-6 undergraduates per year from other faculty. Four broader impacts are apparent. First, if widely deployed, the proposed authentication scheme has the potential to thwart phishing attacks, and even man in the middle attacks, for e-commerce users. Second, advanced assistive technology for mathematics will allow physically disabled people to perform math manipulations on par with able-bodied people. Third, by tracking what a user actually reads, user profiling will result in better, faster searches for relevant information automatically. Finally, high quality eye tracking should provide the UAA faculty with insight into the direct connections between learning and eye patterns"

The prevailing belief is that the severe cold, short growing seasons, high ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, and other environmental conditions not only limit which plants and animals can survive in the Arctic, but constrain their ability to evolve and adapt to current and future conditions. This is a timely subject given the current global climate crisis. PI Whittall (Santa Clara University) and Co-PI Carlson (University of Alaska Anchorage) are addressing this central question by using Arctic mustard species that exhibit variation in their flower colors (purple and white). This variation provides the raw material for evolutionary change and suggests Arctic genomes may actually be more dynamic than previously thought. These flower color differences may represent adaptations to pollinators based on the long-standing assumption that the purpose of flower color is to attract pollinators. Alternatively, the same pigments that paint flowers are also critical for a plant's ability to respond to environmental challenges such as cold, drought, and UV-exposure (the same environmental stresses that increase in the Arctic). Whittall and Carlson will study mustard populations along a latitudinal gradient into the Arctic where pollinators are increasingly scarce and the aforementioned challenging environmental factors increase. Whittall and Carlson, along with undergraduate and graduate students, plan to document the importance of pollinators and environmental factors in determining flower colors. By choosing mustard species, they will be able to use newly developed genomic tools, allowing them to survey the entire genome for differences between plants of different flower colors. Broader impacts of the research include increased insight into gene expression, and an understanding of how easily Arctic genomes can evolve (at least in these mustards). An additional component of the project will involve the creation of a summer-intensive undergraduate course entitled, ""Arctic Biology: From Ecology to the Genome"" where Santa Clara University students will study alongside University of Alaska students both in the Arctic, then back at Santa Clara University. <br/> <br/>"

The rules and norms of local institutions that facilitate effective use of these resources are subject to unprecedented challenges.  This interdisciplinary research project will study the ability of these local institutions to withstand rapid environmental and social change.  Because these changes are particularly acute in the Arctic, this research will study the effects in two salmon-dependent regions on opposite sides of the Bering Sea -- southwestern Alaska and the Russian Far East.  These regions have sharp distinctions in terms of their social, political, and economic histories, but they share similar Yup'ik ethnic backgrounds.  The research team of two economists and an anthropologist who conduct field research in two related phases.  In the first phase, ethnographic methods will be used to document local institutions within the Kuskokwim region of Alaska and the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of Russia.  The second phase will use the tools of experimental economics to test how these institutions perform, particularly how they adapt to greater risk and uncertainty.  In carrying out this project, the investigators will provide a better understanding of the resilience of Arctic resource systems to increased uncertainty and shocks.  Global climate change is already having dramatic impacts on communities in the study region as well as the Arctic as a whole.  Describing and documenting the role of local institutions in enhancing resilience can inform policy options that are applicable to other Arctic social-ecological systems undergoing similar rapid and extreme changes. <br/><br/>In addition to providing broader understanding of the ability of communities that depend upon subsistence hunting and gathering to adapt to change, this research project will provide benefits to the communities participating in the research in a number of ways.  This project will provide meaningful opportunities for undergraduate participation, particularly indigenous students from the communities in the study area.  Student research projects will be designed jointly with tribal councils.  By providing training to local students, this project will help improve education and develop the human capital in these regions.  The investigators will collaborate closely with village leaders in all communities to maximize the relevance of the study the challenges these people face.  Village leaders in both countries have stated that their involvement could provide their people a greater voice in affecting regional policies regarding subsistence harvests.  To help facilitate this, after the research is completed, the research team will return to the communities to report their findings.

While low temperatures and short-growing seasons limit plant growth, enough plant biomass exists to support herds of migratory caribou, on which Alaska Natives depend. Any changes in the plants at the base of the food web can have cascading consequences for herbivores and human consumers and their interactions. Today, the Arctic system is in the midst of change resulting in new vegetation assemblages, changes in the nutritive value of plant tissues, and ultimately in the diets of migratory caribou and the humans that depend on them. This project examines the nutritional landscape of the Central Arctic Caribou Herd as a unifying concept, describing the nutritional landscape as caribou available protein (CAP) and caribou available energy&#8232;(CAE), integrative forage quantity measures that reflect biomass, species composition, plant&#8232;C and N content, digestibility, and secondary compounds. The core objectives are gaining understanding of the drivers of spatial and temporal patterns in the amounts of CAP and CAE across the tundra; caribou use of this nutritional landscape; how the amounts of CAP and CAE will differ in the future under likely climate scenarios and long-term experiments, and the interactions between caribou and Native communities. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this study involve several groups of Alaskan stakeholders, including: harvesters of the North Slope community of Nuiqsut, the worldwide caribou community, and students at multiple stages of education. The project will embed a team member with hunters in Nuiqsut,&#8232;and develop an educational scientific documentary on the caribou - Alaska Native interactions for&#8232;high school students. The group plans to employ village students and undergraduates affiliated with the Alaska Native Science&#8232;and Engineering Program to assist with experimental work and vegetation collection at Toolik Lake. This research is significant to ecologists from the Circumarctic Rangifer Monitoring&#8232;and Assessment Network, dedicated&#8232;to caribou conservation and sustainable management in the US, Canada, and Scandinavia, who will use the data to consider how a suite of climate change scenarios affect herd fecundity and population dynamics. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project stems from the merging of five elements to understand Arctic&#8232;System function and response to climate change: (1) A landscape-scale assessment of plant species, soil and plant C and N, digestibility, and secondary compounds that will be used&#8232;to calculate the amounts of CAP (kg m-2) and CAE (kJ m-2); (2) analysis of how closely caribou foraging is tied to the nutritional landscape throughout the year; (3) analysis of samples&#8232;from an existing long-term winter - summer climate change experiment to provide data on how&#8232;CAP and CAE will differ in the future; (4) prediction of future nutritional landscapes and&#8232;caribou foraging interactions; and (5) observations of Alaska Native hunter harvesting and attributes&#8232;of the system that determine their spatial and temporal patterns. These project components will enable an integrative understanding of how an important herbivore, caribou, interact with a landscape that is rapidly changing. This research: (1) examines the Arctic System from primary production to secondary consumers and the&#8232;influence of climate change across multiple trophic levels; (2) applies broadly by examining&#8232;the most abundant large herbivore and its food sources, both of which are distributed throughout&#8232;the Arctic; and (3) integrates experimental, observational, and modeling approaches to understanding ecological systems and climate change. The integration of observation, experimental data&#8232;and modeling to describe current and forecast future nutritional landscapes is intended to provide a&#8232;mechanistic understanding of Arctic System function and transform the understanding&#8232;of climate-vegetation-caribou-subsistence hunter interactions."

Uncoupling of the temporal relationships between migratory animals and the phenology of the forage they rely on for energy, nutrition, and rearing of young is one of the most glaring consequences of these changes. Furthermore, herbivores in high latitudes are likely to mediate biogeochemical responses to climate change substantially altering ecosystem function. However, little is known about how changes in the synchrony of herbivore-vegetation interactions will influence biogeochemical cycles.<br/><br/>This project will be conducted on the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) Delta in western Alaska, where there is strong evidence that climate change is driving temporal decoupling of the evolved linkage between the phenology of plants and the timing of goose migration. There is an urgency to the research because: some of the most rapid climate changes in the world are underway in Alaska, leaving migratory geese and the ecosystem processes they influence vulnerable to new conditions, and with the rapid advancement of the growing season, migratory goose feeding ecology is lagging substantially, threatening an irreplaceable subsistence resource for Native communities.<br/><br/>The overall research objective is to quantify how an advancing growing season and changes in the synchrony of vegetation-goose interactions alter the magnitudes and patterns of C and N cycling in the Y- K Delta. Two specific questions will be addressed with an experiment: How does the timing of plant growth interact with goose arrival time to alter summer-long magnitudes of plant production, foliar chemistry, and N availability; and, How does the timing of plant growth interact with goose arrival time to alter summer-long magnitudes of net ecosystem CO2 exchange, gross ecosystem photosynthesis, and ecosystem respiration? SAVANNA-YK, a biogeochemical model that considers grazing a critical control on vegetation and trace gas processes in the Y-K Delta, will be used to predict how these ecosystem processes and plant-herbivore interactions will continue to change, altering the nature of ecosystem processes and landscape dynamics in years to come.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the research is three-fold:  The focus on phenologic decoupling of migratory birds and their primary forage on ecosystem biogeochemical cycles is the first of its kind. More specifically, the research is the first to investigate how the timing of herbivory interacts with plant phenology to affect biogeochemical cycles compared to other programs that have focused on the presence or absence of herbivores and/or on herbivore density effects on these cycles; The research is the first to take an experimental approach to the issue of trophic mismatch in the western Alaskan sub-Arctic while integrating these findings with forecasting ecosystem models tailored to wet sedge systems of the north. This combination allows investigation into how climate change effects on herbivore-vegetation interactions will influence large spatial scales in years to come; and The research focuses on plant species that are critical to migratory geese, while other northern studies focusing on climate change effects have focused on tundra plant species that are not critical to migratory bird foraging ecology.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the research will be realized throughh several activities. First, a citizen- science observatory will be established using protocols of the National Phenology Network. Students throughout the Y-K delta will record goose arrival times and key phenological events in grasses and woody plants. Second, students from Bethel Regional High School will be recruited to assist in the field research and be given the opportunity to develop small projects. Researchers will visit village classrooms each spring to introduce the project, climate change, and plant-animal interactions; share results of previous and ongoing research in the study area; and recruit interested students. Third, Native Alaskan undergraduate students through the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program (ANSEP) will be recruited as field and laboratory technicians; these students may also develop their own projects. Fourth, Virtual Science will be used with local teachers to develop blogs, pod-casts, and instructional videos that can be distributed to remote classrooms throughout western Alaska and beyond. Fifth, objectives and results will be communicated to Native organizational bodies, which have representatives from each major village, to build knowledge and support for the research, and provide educational outlets for families who rely on geese for subsistence. Finally, one post-doctoral researcher, one graduate student, and several undergraduates will be provided new training, mentoring, and an opportunity to collaborate on project activities and present their findings at scientific meetings."

Local health care resources and access to transportation are extremely limited. Leveraging existing partnerships, project investigators will conduct surveys with local residents, decision makers, fishermen and processors to characterize risk perception, evaluate social distancing compliance, and assess perceived costs and benefits of various pandemic mitigation plans. These data will inform epidemiological modeling of possible scenarios in the region and help stakeholders understand the dynamics of COVID-19 in a transient population working in the close quarters of fishing vessels and the crowded conditions of fish processing plants.

Surveys will be designed collaboratively, and will leverage existing networks developed as part of an ongoing Navigating the New Arctic project (ICER 1927827). Surveys will be conducted at the beginning of the 2020 fishing season and again in February/March 2021. Analysis will evaluate risk perception and response by occupation, socioeconomic status, age, and sex. Epidemiological modeling will be employed to predict disease dynamics (i.e., likelihood of infection and mortality) under different scenarios; these estimates will be used to project demand for limited health care resources in the region, such as ventilators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When a cloud of plasma is placed within a structure of several long, parallel metal rods with rapidly changing voltage applied to them, some of the plasma particles may be trapped at the center of the structure. This effect provides a laboratory test bed for conducting many new basic plasma physics experiments.  The experiments will be performed along with computer simulations of the same phenomena to gain combined insight into the underlying physics of the collective interactions of the trapped particles.  This project will take place in an environment that is accessible to undergraduate university students.  The results and descriptions of the research will also be incorporated into outreach for physics in the greater Anchorage community.  In particular, the research will create a centerpiece demonstration of plasma science on-site at the University of Alaska - Anchorage to provide formative encounters for K-12 students, and positive engagement with the community at large.<br/><br/>This research is a computational and experimental study of the behavior of low-temperature, quasi-neutral plasma in a three-dimensional, time-varying electric multipole field.  Theoretical work done previously on this topic raised questions that point to the need for such simulations and experiments.  Computer simulations will study the effect of the plasma species' mass difference on the plasma response, e.g. the multipole field's ability to focus the light species to the center of the multipole structure while the space charge is neutralized by the heavy species.  The results of computer modeling will inform an initial experimental design and study of the same effects.  A resonant multipole structure will be constructed and installed in an ultra-high vacuum chamber and experimental measurements of the plasma in the multipole will be made for comparison to the computational results.  The laboratory setup will serve as a versatile testbed for ongoing studies in basic plasma physics, including: plasma effects on ponderomotive gyroresonance; formation and dependences of the radio frequency plasma sheath with variation of the plasma and external field characteristics; the effect of neutralizing space charge on plasma density; and radiation pressure effects on the plasma boundary."

Photochemically-degraded oil is highly complex and poses a hazard to marine organisms. As the circumpolar north loses ice at an unprecedented rate, oil drilling in the Arctic is forecasted to increase, raising the possibility of a major oil spill in a remote cold region. Surface collection agents, or ""chemical herders"" have gained attention recently for the ability to thicken slicks to allow in-situ burning in ice-associated areas for over 90% oil mass removal. However, little is known about the formation of dissolved residues stemming from this process, how dissolved residues are transformed in the presence of sunlight, and what impacts may occur on susceptible marine organisms. This project will advance our understanding of how oil is transformed into a water-soluble form following combustion; it will assess the chemical character and biological uptake of the residues as they weather in Arctic waters. The project will involve residue extraction and analysis at the University of New Orleans and National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The results will guide future oil spill response and contingency planning.<br/><br/>The longitudinal dissolution rates governing hydrocarbon-derived dissolved organic matter, especially those deriving from oxygenation, remain understudied in the Arctic and Subarctic domains with regard to treatment options of oiled water following a maritime point release. Extreme seasonal swings in photoperiods further complicate this process via photodissolution and may have broad impacts on bioaccumulation potential in susceptible marine organisms such as mussels, Mytilus trossulus. Surface collection agents (chemical herders) have gained popularity recently for the ability to thicken oil prior to in-situ burning, a process that is capable of removing >90% of oil from the surface. However, little is known about the formation of dissolved residues stemming from this process and the chemical character as these dissolved residues weather. This project will assess these factors using two new emerging technologies, fluorescence excitation emission spectra (EEMs) coupled with Parallel Factorial Analysis (PARAFAC) and Fourier Transformation Ion Cyclotron Mass Spectrometery (FT-ICR MS). Bench-scale simulations will be conducted at the University of Alaska Anchorage with ANS Crude oil, two herder formulations (OP-40 and ThickSlick), and mussels collected from Resurrection Bay, Alaska.

STN was a four-year collaborative effort by Russian and Alaskan researchers in the early 1990's to collaboratively collect and analyze historical and contemporary demographic, epidemiologic, and domestic data in arctic communities.  The primary investigators died in a boating accident while engaged in data collection at a Russian project site and the records of the project were ultimately donated to the ICHS by the widows of the original research team.

In addition, the conference seeks expanded opportunities for students to receive invaluable feedback from senior scholars in the fields of environmental bioethics and environmental ethics and the conference organizers anticipate that one of the outcomes will be to increase the profile of the developing field of climate ethics within the field of environmental ethics.  <br/><br/>The conference will be open to the public and presentations will canvass issues related to research ethics, health, animal ethics, scientific uncertainty and risk, concepts of social, distributive and intergenerational justice related to global climate change, indigenous rights, the well-being of human and non-human communities in the Arctic, eco-technologies and the moral status of mitigation and adaptation strategies. The conference and resulting publications will also offer the public insight into the complexities of climate change science and philosophy.  The organizers anticipate that the conference will assist the public in identifying gaps in their knowledge and hopefully gain insights into social and moral responsibilities in the wake of environmental challenges."

One of the early signals of certain types of DNA damage is phosphorylation of histone H2A at the site of the lesion, testifying to an important role of chromatin structure in the detection of damage and/or its repair.  Histone acetylation has been shown to facilitate transcription and recombination in many different species, presumably via chromatin decondensation as well as targeting of factors that recognize acetylated nucleosomes.  It is hypothesized that histone acetylation will have an analogous role(s) in facilitating DNA repair. This project will use a combination of genetics and in vivo chromatin analysis in the yeast S. cerevisiae to directly test the roles of combinatorial histone H2A modifications in the process of double strand break (DSB) repair.  The project has two specific aims:  <br/>1.  To determine the roles of specific C-terminal and N-terminal residues of histone H2A in DSB repair in vivo.<br/>2.  To identify and characterize other modifications of histone H2A required for DSB repair. <br/><br/>In addition to increasing our knowledge of the relationships between different histone modifications and DNA repair, a critical aspect of this project is to provide educational research opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Alaska-Anchorage.  The experiments described in this proposal represent research projects for Ph.D., M.S., and B.S. students, and the budget includes direct support for a graduate student.  Also, this laboratory has a unique opportunity to draw Alaska Natives  into the fields of basic cell and molecular biology.<br/>"

In polar regions, however, photoperiod exhibits extreme annual variation culminating with the sun remaining above or below the horizon for extended periods. Without a defined LD cycle, some arctic residents lose daily organization of behavior and physiology, and it has been hypothesized that the molecular clockwork that drives circadian rhythms may be weak or absent in arctic vertebrates. This study tests the hypothesis that persistence of circadian organization in some arctic mammals is adaptive because it allows organisms to minimize thermoregulatory costs. Specifically, the investigators will examine persistence, entrainment, and function of circadian rhythms in the arctic ground squirrel (AGS) during the continuous daylight of the active season and the continuous dark of hibernation. Four research objectives span from molecular and neurobiological mechanisms to physiological, behavioral and ecological adaptation: (1) determine when circadian rhythms are exhibited during the annual cycle of free-living AGS and establish if the onset of rhythmicity in spring coincides with first exposure to light, (2) determine if circadian rhythms persist in the master clock of AGS during hibernation by measuring patterns of clock gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the brain, (3) determine if AGS entrain circadian rhythms to daily changes in light quality or intensity, and (4) investigate patterns of re-entrainment and the function of rhythms in the arctic summer by experimentally phase-shifting free-living ground squirrels and measuring metabolic costs of nocturnal activity. Whether circadian rhythms persist during hibernation is contentious. Transcription and translation are thought to be globally suppressed during deep torpor and the only study to examine clock-gene expression within the SCN during multi-day torpor found no evidence of oscillations. However, circadian body temperature rhythms have been observed in some studies of captive ground squirrels during torpor and timing of arousals has been hypothesized to be controlled by a circadian clock. Persistence of oscillations in clock-gene expression in the SCN would support existence of tissue-specific mechanisms for translational control of a subset of genes relevant to survival during hibernation. In contrast, expression of daily rhythms may not be compatible with hibernation; SCN function and or output may be inhibited to prolong torpor. This study integrates research and learning by (1) training post-docs and students from three universities in ecophysiological studies in the laboratory and field, (2) inclusion of Alaska Natives in research through participation in the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program, and (3) increasing K-12 students' engagement in research by participating in Teacher Research Experience programs. Results of research will be disseminated locally in classroom presentations and nationally through the University of Alaska media relations team."

NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, and integrates the co-production of knowledge. This award fulfills part of that aim. <br/><br/>Climate change is increasing vulnerability of Arctic urban communities to natural hazards such as unstable permafrost, wildfire, and rain-in-winter events. These hazards put residents and property at risk and impose economic costs, and households, businesses, and governments must adapt to these interacting hazards. This research is developing detailed maps showing how the occurrence of these three natural hazards has evolved simultaneously in the Municipality of Anchorage and the Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, and Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada over the past several decades, and how they might change over the next 40 years. The interdisciplinary research team of economists; permafrost, fire, weather, climate, and environmental scientists; and policy experts conducts transdisciplinary research on Arctic natural hazards and their impacts on the natural and built environments and society. The research team works closely with local governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Indigenous groups, insurance companies, and residents to co-produce knowledge on the costs, risks, and actions taken to mitigate and adapt to these hazards. The team and stakeholders collaborate to determine optimal ways to measure the effects of hazards on society and the built environment, identify trade-offs and interactions, develop a multiple-hazard risk assessment, and generate options for future adaptive planning.  This project is one of the first to include effects of climate change on private as well as public infrastructure, a gap which has limited the understanding of effects of climate change in Alaska.  Results provide a framework that other Arctic communities can use to assess risks and reduce economic damages due to climate change and provide examples to increase resilience.  <br/><br/>Research activities over four years include: (1) spatial modeling and mapping of natural hazards and their interactions; (2) gathering data to assess perceived risks, values at risk, and adaptation costs with interviews, property owner surveys, and citizen science; (3) economic modeling of costs and risks; and (4) developing in a series of scenario planning workshops an adaptive policy framework that can be used to adapt to and mitigate multiple hazards and reduce future costs and risks. The research helps partner communities make better-informed decisions regarding how and where to build and manage public and private infrastructure and finance public services. This framework can be used by other Arctic communities to assess risks and reduce economic damages due to climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this effort is to maintain the continuity of the temporally-critical datasets of the ITEX-AON in Alaska and Greenland.  Core datasets include the long-term manual observations of phenology, vegetation structure and composition, ecosystem function, and surface properties on the long-term ITEX control and experimental warming plots, repeat measurement of the vegetation plots on the 1km2 ARCSS grids, and a multifactor warming-moisture experiment in Greenland.  The simultaneous measurement of multiple surface properties at the small scale has allowed detection of relationships not previously recognized, e.g., in moss-dominated areas of the intensive transects, higher albedo is linked to higher temperatures.  Continuation of these measurements is imperative because increasing evidence points towards the critical importance of carry-over effects of the previous growing seasons on current and future responses and the inherent variability in the system precluded determination of the system response on the basis of a few years.  Data from this project are freely available on the ACADIS website.  The project will continue extensive outreach activities established in the initial phase, including strong relationships between the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden (FTBG) and the GVSU Regional Math and Science Center and school systems in Miami, Anchorage, Grand Rapids, and El Paso."

To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. Employing this methodology, the funded project, which is an international coalition between US scientists and those from two Scandinavian nations, seeks to examine whether microbes on the skin and in the gut of wildlife have positive health benefits (i.e., fewer allergies, increased disease resistance, etc.) that are comparable to those discovered in humans with high endemic microbial diversity.  The work also seeks to determine how and/or if wildlife and their endemic microbiomes change under differently managed environments.  Boreal forest wildlife (moose and voles) were selected for study because ~80% of global terrestrial biodiversity is found in boreal forests and because these two species allow comparison between species inhabiting different habitats and interacting with different parts of the ecosystem. Samples will be taken from both species and examined for diverse measures of ""health"", such as internal and external microbial community diversity, parasite/pathogen infection, body condition, etc. Work will focus on quantifying the role microbes play (e.g., supplying energy, inducing or reducing inflammation, increasing or decreasing parasite/pathogen burden) in wildlife health and species response to environmental changes/conditions. It will also address how the microbiome of wildlife is impacted as a result of changes in biodiversity that is driven by changes in land use, different forest management practices, habitat, diet, etc.).  Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration between the US, Finland, and Sweden. Results will help provide better understanding of challenges in biodiversity conservation and the role of global change and forestry management practices on wildlife. The work is also likely to provide new avenues for improved ecological monitoring. In addition, this work provides important information from which to determine whether forest biodiversity impacts human health, via a potential increase in parasite burden due to decreased microbiome diversity in forest wildlife that may increase zoonotic disease risks for humans. Additional impacts include the integration of research and education and the training of students to be part of the new generation of international scholars.  The project also funds an institution in an EPSCoR state (i.e., Alaska).<br/><br/>This award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Using this methodology, the funded project will test the hypothesis: Environmental biodiversity has a positive effect on wildlife health. To test this, state-of-the-art genomics methods, molecular biology, and bioinformatics will be combined with data and measurements from forest community ecology, empirical data, and field experiments. Funds for US participants in the larger international consortium support the part of the larger study that focuses on Alaskan boreal forest moose that are exposed to both direct and indirect human impacts. Indirect impacts would include the increase in human fossil fuel consumption which is contributing to global warming. This warming contributes to increased fire intensity and frequency in Arctic and boreal ecosystems.  Direct impacts are when humans use fire as a tool to manage forest habitats to improve wildlife diversity and/or productivity.  Although in Alaska, burning generally increases the availability and diversity of woody deciduous browses for moose, it also results in juvenile stages of plant growth, reduces ground shading, and increases water stress in plants. This changes plant resource allocation patterns by increasing production of polyphenolics and other structural components. Thus, while fire may produce more browse and support higher densities of moose, their food may be of substantially lower nutritional quality, something that can reduce individual animal productivity and survivorship. The US component of this project addresses the impact of plant chemistry on the microbial composition and function of moose rumen to examine impacts on moose health and population productivity.  Microbiome samples of skin, nasal, and moose lower gastrointestinal tracts will be taken and analyzed to see if such impacts extend to other important microbiomes of the animals and to what extent these contribute to overall wildlife health. The hypothesis that browse diversity and nutritional quality influence moose diets will be tested by quantifying what moose eat, using fecal samples collected from the rectum of anesthetized wild moose and fresh fecal samples collected during field work associated with characterizing the diversity and abundance of foods available to moose in the study sites. Rumen contents of immobilized moose (ten individuals) in unburned and adjacent burned areas of two different moose ranges in interior and southcentral Alaska will also be analyzed.  Diets will be characterized using cuticular alkane/long-chain alcohol signatures of feces and foods as well as plant DNA metabarcoding methodologies.  Habitat food diversity and nutritional characteristics (digestibility, tannins, etc.) will be determined at each of the study sites through plotless surveys of plant diversity and abundance and via standard nutritional analytical procedures. This research will also test the hypothesis that moose diets influence the diversity and function of rumen microbial communities. Rumen and fecal microbiota will be taken and analyzed from each of the moose captured and sampled using high throughput DNA sequencing of 16s rDNA to test this hypothesis. In addition, the hypothesis that microbial community diversity of moose is negatively related to their parasite/pathogen loads will be tested by examining external and intestinal parasite loads of sampled individuals using standard protocols for parasites. These results will be compared using microbial diversity measures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, this project will (1) maintain the data-streams at ITEX-AON sites in Alaska near Toolik Lake, Imnavait Creek, Utqiagvik (Barrow), and Atqasuk; (2) lead two new ITEX network syntheses focused on soil carbon and phenocam imagery; (3) increase scientific literacy; and, (4) expand citizen science opportunities across communities in northern Alaska. The project will sustain an array of large and publicly available data-streams documenting ecosystem change occurring across the Arctic and will team up with citizen scientists to expand the monitoring footprint of the network and the societal relevance of this work to communities across the North Slope of Alaska. <br/><br/>The ITEX network was chartered in 1990 to document and understand the ecological impacts of a warming Arctic. The US-led ITEX projects expanded their monitoring efforts across a larger spatial area with the use of automated sampling to form an Arctic Observatory Network (AON) in 2009. The ITEX-AON currently includes traditional ITEX measurements (phenology, cover, carbon flux and nutrient cycling), as well as phenocams, automated mobile sensor platforms (MISP) and mid-scale aerial imagery of 1 km2 ARCSS (Arctic System Science) grids established in the 1990s. In this phase of the project, collection of core data sets will be sustained and new data sets will be added with the aim of identifying and understanding patterns of change and feedbacks. Specifically, ITEX-AON will expand its collection of vegetation functional traits to better understand ecosystem response and predict future change. ITEX-AON will also further expand automated measurements to link plot level change (sampled by hand or with hand-held equipment) with landscape level observations (sampled by phenocams or drones) and high resolution regional imagery (sampled by aircraft or satellite). The new phase of ITEX-AON will include two synthesis efforts: (1) an examination of soil carbon dynamics across the ITEX network, and (2) a multi-scale phenological analysis using phenocam and high resolution satellite imagery to determine fine-scale spatiotemporal patterns of seasonal greening trends across the Arctic. Mentoring of postdocs, and training of graduate and undergraduate students are some of the primary broader impacts of this project. The project will continue to provide a test bed for engineering and software development that will be shared freely among the ITEX network and broader science community and will expand outreach activities aimed at improving science literacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are a number of coffee table books showcasing beautiful astronomical images, but none of them focus on how the images are made (astrophotography). Books that do describe image-making techniques are primarily ""how to"" books intended for amateur astronomers and do not describe the underlying science. ""Coloring the Universe"" will explain how color-composite images are made, how they are used by scientists for visualization purposes, and how they are shared with the public to highlight new scientific discoveries. The book will also be unique in featuring primarily NSF-funded telescopes and the images made with them. Support from this grant will allow the authors to enhance the book so that it will be more useful as a teaching tool at the undergraduate level. They will add content that provides more information and examples, and they will create a Web site that contains image-making tutorials, data from telescopes with which students can make their own images, and an image gallery allowing students and the public to share their work.<br/><br/>Astronomical images offer an engaging introduction to important topics in astronomy, such as how telescopes and charge-coupled devices (CCDs) work, narrowband filters, and multi-wavelength imaging. Many colleges that have access to small-aperture telescopes and CCD cameras have laboratory exercises in which astronomy students make images of astronomical objects. These labs serve as an important tool for teaching how telescopes and CCDs work, while doing it in a fun, visually appealing way. With its enhanced content, ""Coloring the Universe"" will be a valuable resource for teaching not only how the professionals make images, but why scientists make them the way they do. The tutorials on the Web site will be incorporated into introductory astronomy classes at the University of Alaska Anchorage and will also be presented to instructors in astronomy education groups, such as the Research-Based Science Education (RBSE) group."

It is ""research-based"" in the sense that it integrates scientific research with education. It brings the excitement of discovery into the classroom by getting students to actually do science, not just learn about it from lectures and activities far removed from the actual research process. Students participate in an authentic research project by completing observations on a research-class telescope, analyzing the data and interpreting their results. They collect and interpret information in response to their guided personal exploring and work together as collaborators in a cooperative rather than competitive environment.  <br/><br/>RBSE is a natural integration of research and education because it teaches science as it is done. It incorporates several ""best practice"" teaching strategies which model scientific reasoning. These include focusing on an in-depth project, engaging in out-of class activities, using computers as a tool for data display and analysis, using student logs and concept maps for assessment, and using the Internet. This project is determining the most effective way to implement RBSE curricula in undergraduate classrooms. It is also assessing the student gains from participation.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the activity<br/>For many students, an introductory astronomy course represents their last formal exposure to science. RBSE gives students an opportunity to experience the rewards of research early enough to pursue science as a career. Even if students do not pursue STEM degrees, RBSE develops critical-thinking and teamwork skills that are necessary in any career, and it helps a large number of students understand the scientific process. <br/><br/>About 5,100 students at the University of Alaska Anchorage, Kenai Peninsula College, and Indiana University are participating in the project . The curriculum is being developed to be ""off the shelf,"" such that other undergraduate instructors may use it. Workshops for about thirty instructors per year are held at the national AAPT and AAS meetings to introduce the RBSE pedagogy and developed curriculum, and to develop a national network of educators participating in RBSE.  <br/><br/>Flexible teaching modes such as RBSE engage the broad range of diverse, culturally derived orientations to learning. They are effective in allowing women and minorities, groups that are traditionally underrepresented in science, to find their voice and develop confidence in their ability to do science."

Phenology, the annual timing and progression of events such as aboveground plant growth, is a well-studied an important component of the ecology of climate change, but remains under-studied belowground.  This study will estimate and compare above- and belowground responses of plant phenology to warming and their respective contributions to ecosystem function, specifically the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and tundra.  It will furthermore determine which plant types, e.g., shrubs or grasses, show the greater belowground response to warming and contribution to ecosystem carbon exchange.  <br/>Novel insights into the expected response of the Arctic to climate change will emerge from this experiment, which will also expand the infrastructure for field-based experimental and observational research in the Arctic.

Plasma is a state of matter similar to a gas but consisting of electrically charged particles such as electrons and ions.  The MPT is a structure of specially shaped electrodes that creates electrical conditions in which the plasma particles may be contained due to the focusing effect of rapidly varying voltage applied between the electrodes.  The ability of the MPT to trap various kinds of plasma for laboratory studies will be explored by conducting experiments and computer simulations.  The MPT project at the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA) is the centerpiece of the UAA Plasma Lab, which supports undergraduate research experience across several STEM fields.  Plasma science and engineering is a rapidly growing, multidisciplinary field, with many basic physics questions to be answered as well as technological applications to be developed.  The UAA community, ranging from students working directly on the project to broader K-12 and general public audiences, will observe and participate in the MPT research, will see the benefits and opportunities of STEM education and careers, and will make connections with plasma science and engineering in particular.<br/><br/>This research is an experimental and computational study of the trapping of quasi-neutral plasma by three-dimensional (3D), time-varying electric multipole fields. Prior work has shown that radio-frequency (RF) structures of varying multipole order can trap various plasma configurations, consisting of ions only, electrons and ions, or pair and antimatter plasma components. The multipole field is chosen predominantly to interact strongly with light particles but negligibly with heavy ones.  Two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) modeling has shown that the light species experiences a pseudopotential well, with overall space charge neutralized by the heavy species, and the modeling has defined particular multipole and plasma configurations of interest for detailed 3D PIC modeling and first experimental tests of this Multipole Plasma Trap concept.  The behavior of marginally stable particles at the plasma edge and RF sheath, as well as ponderomotive gyroresonance effects, are new topics to be studied.  The proof of concept experiment will utilize a hexadecapole structure in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber to trap plasma consisting of light positive ions and heavy negative ions, as well as positive ions and electrons, and it will investigate loading the trap via ion sources and diagnosing trapped plasma characteristics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As first inhabitants, stewards, and traditional users intimately tied to the Arctic environment, the discrete status, rights, and interests of Inuit as Indigenous Peoples are affirmed in a number of legally binding treaties, as well as other international human rights instruments and domestic laws. Inuit authorities, organizations, and communities are central to the establishment and maintenance of effective mechanisms for safeguarding this ecologically and culturally unique region.<br/><br/>The Food Sovereignty and Self-Governance Project aims to advance understanding of Inuit self-governance of marine resources deemed crucial for Inuit food security. This includes exploring how Inuit co-management systems support food sovereignty objectives - outcomes that are essential for supporting human rights of Inuit communities. This project will examine the role Inuit communities in Alaska and Canada play in managing these resources as co-equal partners with their counterparts in federal, state, and local government agencies. The results derived from the research will prove valuable to other Arctic federal governments collaborating with Indigenous communities to achieve objectives related to the environmental, social, and ecological well-being of the Arctic. <br/><br/><br/>The project's overarching goals are to:<br/><br/>1) Synthesize the existing legal frameworks providing for Inuit self-governance by evaluating applicable legal authorities in the United States (U.S.) and Canada;<br/>2) Determine how existing Inuit self-governance approaches operate in practice by examining four co-management case studies as examples of approaches to food sovereignty. This will provide a comprehensive understanding of the social, political, and institutional parameters affecting implementation of key legal frameworks;<br/>3) Understand whether and how Inuit self-governance systems support food sovereignty by comparing food sovereignty objectives against both these legal frameworks and observation of the implementation of those systems in practice; and<br/>4) Disseminate Project findings to Inuit, state/territorial, national, and international leaders with the goal of supporting and driving improvements to systems providing for collaborative management of Arctic marine resources in the face of rapid ecological change.<br/><br/>The Project Team will take a two-tiered analytical approach to address these goals: (1) doctrinal legal research that evaluates legal and institutional frameworks; and <br/>(2) socio-legal analysis through case-studies.   The legal research will examine relevant laws, regulations, and policies at all levels of government, building a framework essential to understanding how Arctic collaborative governance functions in theory.  The case studies will take the next step - moving from how these governance systems should work to how they operate in practice - and, ultimately, how they could be improved in a manner which optimizes outcomes for food sovereignty, human rights, and resource sustainability. Case studies conducted in partnership with those participating in co-management regimes, will focus on Walrus and Salmon in Alaska and Char and Beluga in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region of Canada. Current partners of this project include:<br/><br/>(1) The Eskimo Walrus Commission<br/>(2) The Fisheries Joint Management Committee<br/>(3) The Inuvialuit Game Council<br/><br/>Organizations advising this project include both the Association of Village Council Presidents and the Inuit Circumpolar Council Canada.<br/><br/>Project researchers conducting the case study analysis will follow a ""co-production of knowledge"" approach, in which no one person's information and knowledge is assigned greater inherent value than another's. Researchers with utilize Indigenous Knowledge and social science methodologies. The project will intimately engage with Inuit who play a role in natural resources management in the U.S. and Canadian Arctic under each case study, through focus groups, semi-directive interviews and discussions'all guided by input provided by an expert Advisory Committee. <br/><br/>The Project will advance the state of knowledge on how Inuit self-governance approaches support Inuit food sovereignty objectives and resource sustainability. With a combined focus on the United States and Canada, the Project will enable comparative analysis of legal and institutional structures, practices, and perceptions to facilitate critical evaluation of Inuit self-governance over marine resources as embodied in co-management regimes. This research will also be useful for other Arctic nations that are working with Indigenous peoples to achieve the environmental, social, and ecological well-being of the Arctic."

Cruise ships are travelling through the Northwest Passage, oil exploration is occurring off the North Slope of Alaska, and the Northern Sea Route is seeing an increasing volume of cargo ships travelling through it. In Arctic Alaska, these tourism and industrial activities will occur far away from the infrastructure and resources of urban and industrial centers, limiting response capabilities when an emergency occurs in Arctic waters. For all of these reasons, there is a critical need to improve Emergency Response in the Arctic (ERA) to meet the increase in the demand for these capabilities. The scientific contribution of this research is to create prescriptive decision-making models that help to determine where, when, and how to make infrastructure investments to improve global ERA capabilities while also providing benefits to Arctic communities. Because the infrastructure required to improve ERA will be built and maintained in local Arctic communities, this project will involve Arctic stakeholders, including representatives from indigenous communities, to guide the research and help disseminate its results. This project contributes to the NSF's Big Idea on Navigating the New Arctic by: (1) safeguarding human and environmental welfare in increasing ERA capabilities and (2) working closely with local and indigenous populations to co-produce knowledge about the types of benefits potentially provided to communities should ERA infrastructure be located in them. Potential benefits include local management of ERA infrastructure and deployment of resources, training and workforce development opportunities, and improved transportation infrastructure.<br/><br/>This research will create new Operations Research (OR) models that not only account for where and when to make infrastructure investments to improve ERA capabilities but how to properly integrate these investments into the communities where they are located.  To accomplish this, this project is creating an innovative methodology where social science research done in conjunction with local Arctic communities is conducted in a way that informs the creation of the OR models and, in later stages of the work, validates their results. Therefore, this research integrates methods across OR and social science that link economic, social, cultural, and technical feasibility and desirability by incorporating expert local knowledge into the planning process. The results of this research will transform our understanding of how to design ERA systems that have positive impacts in the local communities where the supporting infrastructure is built and maintained.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, while ongoing climate warming and permafrost thaw are expected to increase plant productivity (CO2 uptake), continued warming is also expected to weaken prior constraints on decomposition (CO2 emissions). The net effect of these changes on the Arctic?s carbon budget and the global climate system are poorly understood, as most observations have been made during the short growing season, when root and rhizosphere respiration dominate CO2 emissions.  This project will focus on the development of a new technology for the continuous collection of CO2 emitted from arctic tundra soils. This passive diffusive sieve (zeolite) trap for measuring soil respired CO2 will be rugged, small, lightweight, low-cost, and require little in the way of power (batteries) low power.  It has the potential to transform our understanding of carbon cycling in the Arctic, as it allows for the year-round CO2 collection, including during the winter and shoulder seasons when sites are often inaccessible, and over multiple weeks (3 weeks/sample), thus integrating both diffusive and episodic emissions.  Outreach activities will strengthen the existing NSF-supported K-12 training programs at UC Irvine that are aimed to increase the participation of underprivileged populations in the STEM fields. THE Investigators will engage middle school students with lab tours and activities during a ?Day at College?-experience and class room visits. The project will also train a graduate student, and contribute to educating researchers (via an international summer course) in the use of 14C analysis in Ecology and Earth System Science.<br/><br/>The investigators will develop and deploy a novel system to continuously trap CO2 emitted from arctic tundra soils over several weeks for radiocarbon (14C) analysis.  However, typical canister-based systems for measuring soil respired CO2, can be relatively large, expensive to ship, and require line power.  This project will develop and deploy a novel system to continuously trap CO2 emitted from Arctic tundra soils over several weeks for radiocarbon (14C) analysis.  This continuous collection system has the potential to transform carbon cycle research.  Such devices would obviate the need for shipping large canisters to the Arctic as well and the need for line power.  Moreover, such devices are relatively inexpensive and lightweight, and therefore, permit for high spatial resolution monitoring.  These new traps, however, have never been tested in the Arctic, where the environmental conditions can be harsh, especially in winter.  Thus the focus of this work is to develop, harden, and test such devices through a number of winter seasons at the Toolik Lake Long Term Ecological Station, on the north slope of Alaska.  If successful, this device will provide the first year-round, quasi-continuous dataset on soil-respired 14CO2 in moist acidic tussock tundra, which is the dominant tundra type of arctic Alaska and globally accounts for over 20% of the tundra land surface.  Moreover, this research will point the way for other experimental groups working in similar harsh environments throughout the Arctic."

The research has the potential to transform understanding of lithosphere-scale processes by clarifying the effect of flat subduction on the upper crust and basins using a combination of sedimentary and basin analyses, thermochronology and geodynamic modelling to enable discrimination of the relative contributions of crustal loading mechanisms. In addition to the scientific goals of the project, the collaboration is advancing important societal outcomes by contributing to STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) educator development, the broadening of participation of underrepresented groups in science, the training of a postdoctoral researcher and graduate and undergraduate students. Public outreach efforts by the University of Alaska and education of middle school students through newly established relationships between the University of Houston and local middle schools and middle-school aged homeschooled students contributes to increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with STEM. The project also supports the development of a new partnership between the participating universities and industry, thereby contributing to the increased economic competitiveness of the United States.<br/><br/>Although migrating dynamic subsidence has long been invoked to explain the broadening and migration of the Late Cretaceous depocenter, no research has taken a high resolution, large-scale approach to characterizing the timing or direction of migration or to discriminate flexural from dynamic subsidence. However, flexural loading and subcrustal loading leave distinct foreland-basin deposits that record sediment source area and source area exhumation rate and have a characteristic fill geometry that records the locus and rate of subsidence. Detailed investigation of stratigraphic architecture, sediment volumes, sediment sources, and depositional products allows the research team to explore the potential influence of flat subduction of an oceanic plateau versus continued or enhanced thrust belt exhumation or incipient basement-cored uplifts. The Cordilleran system presents an unparalleled opportunity to establish the effect of flat subduction of an oceanic plateau in the best dated retroarc foreland basin system on the planet; thus, the results of this investigation are applicable to other ocean-continent convergent systems. The research team is evaluating mechanisms for observed changes in basin architecture by integrating sandstone compositional data, detrital thermo- and geochronology, high-resolution sequence stratigraphy, high-resolution isopach maps, geohistory analysis, and forward stratigraphic, flexural, and geodynamic modelling. New detrital geochronology and sandstone compositional data are supplementing published geochronology and sedimentology to more accurately identify changes in sediment provenance and routing during this time. Detrital thermochronology is delineating up-section changes in lag time, corresponding to changes in source exhumation rates, or introduction of a new sediment source. Sequence stratigraphy, decompacted isopach maps, and forward stratigraphic modelling allow calculation and comparison of the average sediment supply to discriminate changes in basin architecture due to sediment supply from accommodation-driven changes. Reconstruction of basin subsidence is being accomplished using detailed isopach maps and geohistory analysis, which facilitates discrimination of crustal loads from a subcrustal load. Finally, flexural and geodynamic modelling enables discrimination of the relative contributions of loading mechanisms. This project will combine, for the first time, the strengths of detrital geo- and thermochronological double-dating, high-resolution sequence stratigraphy, and multiple modeling efforts at a scale and resolution capable of discriminating the mechanisms for subsidence. As a result of this collaboration, this project has potential to transform the understanding of lithosphere-scale processes by clarifying the effect of flat subduction on the upper crust and basins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) was established in the early 1990s to understand the effects of warming and environmental variability on tundra vegetation properties and ecosystem function.  The ITEX program has been extremely valuable for detection of changes in tundra plant and ecosystem responses to experimental warming and to background climate change across sites that span the major ecosystems of the Arctic.  In 2007, the Alaskan and Greenland ITEX sites were combined into an Arctic Observatory Network (AON).  The current ITEX AON project will continue to document and understand Arctic terrestrial vegetation change and its ecosystem consequences by maintaining the long-term datasets of the ITEX-AON.  The warming experiment of ITEX-AON allows us to assign the cause for observed changes in response to warming instead of relying on simple correlations.  This project provides urgently needed data on changes in vegetation and the importance of these changes for ecosystem services from a variety of Arctic ecosystems.  This project will provide training for postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students in the emerging fields of remote sensing, cybertechnology and big-data analysis. The project will include outreach activities through strong relationships with the CLEO Institute in Miami; the Grand Valley State University Regional Math and Science Center; and K-12 school systems in Miami, Anchorage, Grand Rapids and El Paso. All data from this project are and will be freely available at the NSF Arctic Data Center.<br/><br/>The core datasets of the proposed research include manual observations of phenology, vegetation structure and composition, and ecosystem function (carbon flux and nutrient cycling) on long-term ITEX control and experimental warming plots, repeat measurement of vegetation plots on the long-term 1 km2 vegetation grids, and a multifactor warming/moisture experiment in Greenland. In 2009, the sampling scheme was expanded to include a larger spatial component to amplify the value of the measurements collected. This expansion included the addition of phenocams, automated mobile sensor platforms, and medium-scale aerial imagery. The automated platforms measure a suite of vegetation surface properties with minimal effort across focal transects spanning strong moisture and microtopographic gradients at a near-daily frequency. These measurements capture the fine-scale changes in vegetation over the growing season that are missed by lower frequency manual measurements and provide a bridge between manual measurements and aerial imagery. Medium-scale aerial imagery, using Kite Aerial or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, is acquired throughout the growing season for scaling of manual and automated measurements; satellite imagery is referenced to medium-scale aerial imagery to aid scaling of responses to the regional level. In the newest phase of AON ITEX, we are particularly focused on understanding the relationship between landscape subsidence as a result of permafrost thaw and vegetation structure and function because of the potential for significant positive feedbacks to climate change."

Recent research by the principal investigators (PIs) suggests the importance of winter snow depth as a control on tree growth.  They now propose to experimentally isolate the importance of snow depth and soil nutrient availability for tree growth.  This novel and interdisciplinary proposal will link the ecology of microbes to large-scale landscape patterns.  If their hypotheses are confirmed, the findings will contradict the prevailing theory of the cause of treeline location.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to the development of the science workforce by supporting the training of three graduate students and the entrainment of numerous undergraduate students into the research activities.  Outreach to the predominantly Alaskan Native community of Kotzebue will take different forms.  The PIs will arrange with the local radio station, a primary means of media communication for the local region, to describe their research.  They will visit the local high school to discuss the role of vegetation in climate and to share the results of their research.  They will provide opportunities for outstanding students from the local high school to participate in their field research program.  They will participate in the Bureau of Land Management?s Campbell Creek Science Center Fireside Chat series to promote outreach to the more urban community in and around Anchorage, AK.  They will enhance the existing Interactive Model of Leaf Decomposition (IMOLD), a series of animated lessons and activities about decomposition and nutrient cycling developed under a previous award, to include examples and teaching activities derived from this work at the Arctic treeline.<br/><br/>It has long been thought that temperature exerts a direct control on growth of treeline trees and the position of the treeline.  However, the PIs? recent work in the Arctic with white spruce suggests that indirect effects of temperature on soil nutrient availability may be of equal or greater importance.  They hypothesize that cold soils at the treeline, particularly during winter, limit microbial activity and nutrient availability to the point where trees are barely able to survive and grow.  Measurements made during winter have revealed that Arctic forests maintain snowpacks that are much deeper than observed at treeline.  Trees are thought to trap snow and lead to a deeper snowpack, insulating the soil from cold air and allowing for greater overwinter microbial activity and greater nutrient mineralization.  Indeed, the PIs found a strong positive correlation between white spruce growth and winter snow depth.  They propose to isolate the mechanisms underlying this correlation by using snowfences to manipulate winter snow depth and fertilizer to increase soil nutrient availability at three treelines that differ in soil moisture.  To provide an experimental test of the importance of temperature as a direct control on treeline tree growth, they propose to incorporate experimental shoot warming into their snowfence experiment in a factorial design.  They predict that both experimental snow and nutrient additions will lead to large increases in microbial activity, photosynthesis, tree growth, seed quality, seed production, seedling establishment and recruitment of new trees.  They expect to observe the greatest positive responses where soils are wet and cold. Meanwhile, they predict that shoot warming will lead to negligible changes in growth."

To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. Employing this methodology, this research project, which is an international coalition between US scientists and those from four other nations with Arctic territories, seeks to evaluate freshwater biodiversity and food web dynamics in the circumpolar Arctic region and their value for people, communities, and the region. For this project, each country provides funds to support their own investigators and their part of the research. This project characterizes the current state of biodiversity along latitudinal gradients (north to south) in the Arctic and uses experiments and computer models to develop change scenarios in response to climate warming because Arctic warming can cause various physical environmental changes, such as permafrost thaw, which can result in changes in water quality, water temperature, food webs, and fish distributions. Shifts in food resources that might result could have large impacts on far north human populations (e.g., subsistence activities, commercial and recreational fisheries, etc.).  Through field studies, experiments, modeling, and forecasting, this project develops linkages between climate change, freshwater biodiversity, and consequences for ecosystem services in Arctic freshwaters, all of which have potential socio-economic impacts. Although a large body of literature exists on Arctic freshwater fishery economics, interactions between habitat conditions and the socio-economic consequences of human- and climate-induced changes in the productivity of Arctic lakes and rivers are poorly known. This study fills that gap. Broader impacts of the research include international collaboration between scientists in the US and Denmark/Greenland, Norway, Sweden, and Canada. They also include identifying shifts in biodiversity to assist countries in recognizing early warning signs of climate change-related ecological impacts in the Arctic; assessing economic implications for changes in Arctic biodiversity, something critical to managing regional resources and/or developing science-based policies and regulations; enabling circumpolar harmonization of sampling methods, data storage, and large-scale analysis to promote future circumpolar assessments of biodiversity change; and improving our knowledge and understanding of Arctic food security for native peoples and others in the region who depend on freshwater fisheries. The project also supports a PI from a gender underrepresented in the sciences at an institution in an EPSCoR state (i.e., Alaska), thereby broadening participation of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Using this methodology, the funded project will address knowledge gaps on the links between biodiversity and ecosystem services in Arctic lakes and rivers. The approach undertaken includes using physical/chemical climate change models to develop biodiversity change scenarios which incorporate multiple trophic levels and predict consequences of biodiversity scenarios to ecosystem services. Specific research objectives include: (1) evaluation of biodiversity and functional trait patterns in relation to environmental drivers and identify biodiversity hotspots in freshwater ecosystems (lakes and rivers) across latitudinal gradients in the Arctic; (2) insight into how direct and indirect drivers related to climate change impact the biodiversity and trait composition of Arctic aquatic food webs, and ultimately fish production; (3) quantifying uncertainty in biodiversity scenarios for Arctic freshwaters through empirical observations and experimental simulations; and (4) assessing the effects of nutrient enrichment and terrestrial land change on community structural and functional measures across latitudinal gradients in North America and Europe. Other approaches include use of bio-economic models to evaluate socio-economic trade-offs and potential shifts in ecosystem services in Arctic lakes and rivers associated with climate change, nutrient enrichment, and resource exploitation; developing assessment criteria that better quantify the ecological change in Arctic lakes and streams and provide strategies for the early detection of new and/or invasive species and that can feed into the development of biodiversity scenarios; and providing information and research results that better inform resource managers, regulators, and policy makers, as well as people who live in the Arctic and the global community concerned about the ongoing change in Arctic freshwater ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Howeever, it is still unknown how entire genomes - the total genetic information encoded in an organism's DNA - respond to novel conditions.  In particular, when independent populations adapt to similar environments, it is unclear what proportion of genomic changes occur in the same way.  Studies of threespine stickleback fish provide an excellent opportunity to address this problem.  Repeatedly, the ocean form of sticklback has invaded and become isolated in freshwater habitats, which has resulted in replecated patterns of divergence in traits such as bone size, body coloration and mating behavior. The goal of this research is to analyze patterns of divergence across entire genomes of multiple populations of Alaskan oceanic stickleback that colonized freshwater ponds formed during a massive earthquake in 1964. Using cutting-edge sequencing technology and newly developed techinques for evaluating genome-wide patterns of genetic variation, this project will evaluate the similarity of genomic responses of each population to their new freshwater habitats. This research provides a case study of the genomic changes that occur during the responses of organisms to both natural and human-caused environmental changes. In addition, the results of this work will provide a better understanding of the genomic basis of how organisms respond to climate change, another environmental perturbation that could stimulate rapid evolution.

For the past 25 years, communities in Alaska's North Slope Borough have sustained themselves through a combination of wage employment derived from petroleum revenues, harvests mf caribou, marine mammals, and other resources. Local control has been exercised through regional government and Native-owned corporations. The principal climate changes considered in this study are rising temperatures, increased precipitation and increased frequency of extreme events. Climate changes of these types will affect caribou and other populations important to the local subsistence economy, as well as construction, transportation and regional development. The policy audience includes state and national entities and the North Slope Borough. An interdisciplinary group will focus on a number of goals including: the development of a vegetation model that predicts forage for caribou and a model that responds to climate variables and human harvest; a subsistence hunting/wage employment model as affected by caribou and wage opportunities; an econometric and institutional analysis of petroleum investments as affected by environmental costs and public policies; a comparative analysis of policy vehicles for responding to forces of change; and the development of a synthesis framework for relating policies to future outcomes. The study will not attempt to link the detailed subsystem models in a single grand model. Rather, the subsystem models will be designed to operate independently with the outputs of one subsystem model serving as key inputs to the other subsystem models. Integration of the subsystems will start with a simple meta-model that reflects gross changes and then successively elaborate the model to a level of detail appropriate to address specific policy questions. The ultimate goal is to develop a means by which policy makers  can systematically examine relationships between policy choices and possible futures, as well as to provide a vehicle for scientists from different disciplines to combine their data and develop complementary research programs.   ***                  ??"

Arctic ground squirrels have unique adaptations that allow them to thrive under arctic conditions. The proposed work will resolve important questions in hibernation physiology using integrated approaches including respirometry for measuring rates of metabolism and respiratory exchange, stable isotope analysis for assessing changes in metabolic fuel use and body composition, and genomic approaches for a molecular understanding of hibernation in extreme conditions. This project seeks to 1) elucidate which metabolic fuels (fat, carbohydrate, protein) arctic ground squirrels draw from during arctic hibernation, 2) quantify the expression of genes for enzymes involved in metabolic fuel selection, 3) identify lower thermal limits to hibernation at sub-zero body temperatures, and 4) continue monitoring body and hibernacula temperatures in a natural population on the North Slope of Alaska.  These field measures will be related to changes in body condition over winter, annual timing of hibernation and other life history events, and effects on reproduction and persistence of this population in the context of climate change.  It is anticipated that arctic ground squirrels will hibernate in ambient temperatures as low as -40 degrees C, and that they will increase reliance on protein to fuel metabolism with decreasing ambient temperatures.  At low temperatures, regulation of metabolic fuel selection by arctic ground squirrels will be accomplished via increased expression of genes that promote protein metabolism and gluconeogenesis (synthesis of sugar).  Because hibernators have been used as models for cerebral ischemia (reduced blood flow to the brain), traumatic head injury, and hypothermia, investigations of the physiology and genomics of hibernation have biomedical implications.  Moreover, this research will help us better understand organismal responses to a changing climate in the sensitive arctic ecosystem. This project is interdisciplinary and will provide training, in both field and lab settings, to 1 post-doc, 2 PhD students and undergraduates in molecular, isotopic, physiological and ecological techniques.

Among the earliest signals of climate warming in the Arctic have been changes in the seasonal timing of life cycle events (phenology). Plants are leafing, flowering, and fruiting earlier than ever recorded. Because phenology and physiology are tightly coupled, ecosystem functions such as primary production, as well as the outcome of competition depend on phenological responses. Species phenological and physiological responses to warming differ, causing changes in community composition, biodiversity, and ecosystem function. However, in contrast to phenology, change in community composition is difficult to detect and ascribe to a particular phenomenon. Changes in phenology and species abundance being reported across the Arctic are consistent with the findings of the long-term experimental warming of the ITEX network, a plot-scale, nondestructive, warming experiment conducted across the tundra biome beginning in 1990. Remote sensing analyses have also detected earlier greening and increased biomass across polar regions, but cannot readily identify the basis for changes in community composition, can only infer function, and can say nothing about community trajectories.<br/><br/>The ITEX network was specifically designed to study phenology and community composition, and has also been used effectively to study ecosystem processes. It is perfectly positioned for an intensive, comprehensive study of decadal-scale changes in phenology, community composition, and ecosystem function in response to background climate change, and has the added value of long-term experimental warming. The baseline data and sampling power of the ITEX network and its experimental approach are unparalleled. This effort will compare the results of a renewed field campaign of phenology and plant community composition measurements on warmed and control plots during the IPY with historical data from 10-15 years ago. The PIs will hold two workshops to synthesize the long-term phenological and community changes observed across the network. Furthermore, a new suite of minimally invasive measurements will cross compare indices of ecosystem function - including: leaf, litter, and soil nutrients; isotopic composition; and secondary chemistry - in the control and warmed plots across the network. The long-term nature of these experiments and the global coverage of the coordinated network will lead to unique insights regarding the tundra response to past, ongoing, and future climate changes.<br/>"

Modeling efforts suggest these effects are relevant on regional and global scales. Our understanding of the controls on tree growth at the arctic treeline has been developed using tree ring studies, which are necessarily correlative and not mechanistic in nature. These tree ring studies have identified both positive and negative radial growth responses to warming in the later half of the 20th century. Investigators have speculated that negative growth trends reflect an increasing importance of temperature-induced drought stress and that treeline advance may be expected in mesic and wet areas, but not in dry areas, with future climate warming. Recent work has revealed several important complexities that clearly show we have oversimplified the relationships between climate and tree growth at the arctic treeline. Detailed measurements of seasonal changes in tree physiology and growth in response to changes in resource availability are now required to take our understanding to the next level. This work will coordinate continuous measurements of white spruce canopy gas exchange with weekly measurements of branch gas exchange and leader, branch, radial and fine root growth in trees receiving factorial nutrient and water supplements along a gradient of parent material depth. Results of the study will, for the first time: resolve the seasonality of C uptake and water loss in treeline white spruce; compare the seasonality and magnitudes of growth in all major organs; articulate the consequences of changes in resource availability for white spruce gas exchange physiology and growth along a gradient where resource availability varies naturally; and identify a process-based model that accurately describes the relationships between climate and tree growth at the arctic treeline. <br/><br/><br/>"

The workshop was an international interdisciplinary group of Indigenous scholars, cultural practitioners, students and non-Indigenous scholars working with or for Indigenous communities to discuss the development of spatial data infrastructure (SDI) capable of representing Indigenous perspectives of modeling environmental phenomena. The organizer of the workshop, the late Dr. Deanna Kingston of Oregon State University, concluded at the completion of the workshop, ""We learned two things: 1. Each Indigenous community as well as each academic discipline is at a different developmental stage of understanding, the who, what, when, where, and why of SDI representation, which means we needed to collectively identify the starting point and path for this kind of project. 2. One of the points of collective agreement was the necessity of relating to our environments through sustainable principles, protocols, and practices (Hi'iaka Working Group, 2011)."" <br/><br/>The WIS2DOM workshop will build on the lessons learned from the first workshop, by facilitating the concluding perspective that indigenous peoples who maintain a strong connection with their territory through subsistence or sustainable agriculture have a deep spatial knowledge that fully integrates humans into the natural world, a knowledge that is not fundamentally different from the developing transdisciplinary science of sustainability. The PIs maintain that despite holding a similar vision of sustaining resilient landscapes, Indigenous and sustainability sciences have not entered into dialogue on how to accomplish this common goal. <br/><br/>The research team and organizers of this workshop recognize the value of ontological pluralism with regard to advancing scientific research and through this proposed workshop, will bring Indigenous and sustainability scientists into dialogue in order to diversify methods toward meeting common goals.

Just what percentage of the population is light, and what percentage is heavy, is still under active study. Because cosmic rays are charged and their trajectories bend in magnetic fields, they do not point back to their origin; determining the origin of these particles is an unsolved problem with a 100-year heritage. Features in the energy spectrum (such as kinks, bumps, or changes in slope) are important clues, thought to be related to changes in composition and origin.

This brine is currently the source of the majority of the world's lithium supply.  The evolution of the salt and brine deposits is controlled by the tectonics of the Salar de Atacama basin and the extreme arid climate of the Atacama Desert.  Climate records for these types of environments give important clues to understanding modern and future climate change patterns of the Earth.  The Salar de Atacama is one of the most important hyper-arid environments on the planet and therefore is the focus of many climate proxy investigations.  An unprecedented opportunity to extend the climate record back to 4 million years exists through sediment cores that have recently been recovered by the lithium mining industry from the south and transitional margin of the Salar de Atacama basin.  This project will focus on characterizing the depositional environments and climate proxies preserved in these cores and on placing these records in a robust chronological framework.  As such, radioisotopic dating of the deposits is important in determining environmental change at the margin of Salar de Atacama over the last 4 million years.  This study will provide a framework relevant to future research questions related to the origin of the lithium-rich brine, life in extreme environments, and climatic change in hyper-arid environments.<br/><br/>Abstract (technical)<br/><br/>The goal of this work is to develop a paleoenvironmental record derived from recently recovered strata in drill cores from the southern margin of the Salar de Atacama, Chile.  The focus of this work will be to develop a robust chronological framework within which to interpret the complex and high- resolution stratigraphic record of environmental dynamics.  Strong gradients in tectonic processes, topography, and climate of this region give rise to one of largest active salt depo-centers in the world.  This area is of considerable scientific interest because it is one of the most extreme environments on the planet. The new drill cores span a modern environmental gradient including alluvial environments, groundwater discharge marshes, sulfate-rich playas, saline lagoons, and a halite nucleus with shallow subsurface brine.  Some of the cores contain strata that may be as old as 3.5?4.0 Ma.  Many of these cores exhibit obvious and astounding shifts in paleoenvironment.  Therefore, this study will provide the most detailed and comprehensive record of climate and environment from the Salar de Atacama.  The geologic materials from the cores are sensitive to environmental conditions and therefore need to be sampled and analyzed within an appropriate timeframe.  The cores will be described, and key intervals of ignimbrite and ash, carbonates, halite, mud and other sediments will be sub-sampled for the geochronologic work and for elemental and isotopic proxy investigations.  Dating techniques will include a combination of 40Ar/39Ar, 14C and U-Th depending on the sediment and volcanic deposit types. Stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen in carbonate will be measured to constrain changes in climatic conditions.  Lithium concentrations in salts will be measured to further understand the dynamic water balance in the system through time.  Hydrogeological characteristics of the materials will aid in understanding the pathways of fluids in the subsurface, and inform climatic interpretation of shifting environments in this hydrologically complex system."

Death quickly ensues from oxygen lack due to the failure of organs, such as the heart, which require a constant supply of oxygen to create the metabolic energy necessary to support their continued function. However, in stark contrast to ""normal"" vertebrates, a few vertebrate species have evolved the remarkable ability to survive for prolonged periods in the complete absence of oxygen (termed anoxia). This research focuses on elucidating how the heart of one of the vertebrate champions of anoxia survival, the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta), can continue to beat rhythmically during anoxia, albeit more slowly.  Previous research has revealed that the intrinsic rate at which the turtle heart beats is vastly slowed by anoxia exposure. However, the mechanisms that act to suppress the intrinsic heart rate during anoxia remain unknown. In the vertebrate heart, intrinsic heart rate is determined by cells located in a specialized region, termed the cardiac pacemaker. The pacemaker cells initiate cardiac contraction by producing electrical impulses, called pacemaker action potentials, the rate of which sets intrinsic heart rate. This research will utilize a multi-tiered and multidisciplinary approach to investigate the physiological mechanisms by which anoxia and low temperature modulates pacemaker rate.  Ultimately, by probing how a vertebrate heart can continue to beat in the absence of oxygen, this research will develop a deeper understanding of the connections between oxygen, metabolism and electrical excitation, which are a crucial aspect of basic cardiac biology. In addition, the intimate intertwining of research activities with training, education and mentoring opportunities in contemporary physiology and cell biology for students at UAA as well as those of the broader Alaskan community will broaden exposure and enhance opportunity in scientific research for individuals that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/><br/>Remarkably, the heart of one of the vertebrate champions of anoxia survival, the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta) can continue to beat rhythmically during anoxia, albeit more slowly.

However, the mechanism by which anoxia modulates pacemaker rate remains unknown. The overarching objective of this research is to exploit the turtle heart as a model to elucidate the physiological and cellular mechanisms of cardiac pacemaker regulation. This research will utilize a multi-tiered and multidisciplinary approach to systematically investigate in the organ (contractile properties of isolated heart chambers; in vitro recordings of pacemaker action potentials) and cell (electrophysiological measures of ionic currents in isolated cardiomyocytes) the alterations of the cardiac pacemaker that underlies the resetting of intrinsic heart rate by anoxia. The proposed research will provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of cardiac pacemaking in conditions of low oxygen and temperature. Both have pertinence to basic cardiac biology as well as human pathology, and the anoxic turtle provides a remarkable model of how these processes persist in conditions of substantial stress."

Weddell seals in Erebus Bay, Antarctica, provide an unparalleled opportunity to investigate how an animal's physiology, behavior, and genetic make-up contribute to lifetime reproductive success because they have been the subject of a long-term population monitoring study and are easily accessible during their reproductive season. This project will distinguish key differences in energy allocation, reproductive timing, and dive capacities between female Weddell seals with a history of frequently producing pups (""high-quality"" group), versus females that have produced pups only infrequently (""low-quality"" group). For each group of females, physiology and behavior during the nursing period will be analyzed to assess whether investments influence their probability of reproducing the following year. Whole genomes will be compared between groups to identify underlying genes that govern reproductive success and population stability in a long-lived mammal. This collaborative project will provide research opportunities and training to several undergraduate and graduate students at the three participating institutions. Results will be broadly disseminated through presentations and peer-reviewed publications, and to students via an extensive public outreach collaboration with museum programming, curriculum-aligned science lessons, and pedagogy training.<br/><br/>Within any wild animal population there is substantial heterogeneity in reproductive rates and animal fitness. Not all individuals contribute to the population equally; some are able to produce more offspring than others and thus are considered to be of higher quality. This study aims to distinguish which physiological mechanisms (energy dynamics, aerobic capacity, and fertility) and underlying genetic factors make some Weddell seal females particularly successful at producing pups year after year, while others produce far fewer pups than the population average. In this project, an Organismal Energetics approach will identify key differences between high- and low-quality females in how they balance current and future reproductive success by tracking lactation costs, midsummer foraging success and pregnancy rates, and overwinter foraging patterns and live births the next year. Repeated sampling of individuals' physiological status (body composition, endocrinology, ovulation and pregnancy timing), will be paired with a whole-genome sequencing study. The second component of this study uses a Genome to Phenome approach to better understand how genetic differences between high- and low-quality females directly correspond to functional differences in transcription, translation, and ultimately phenotype. This component will contribute to the functional analysis and annotation of the Weddell seal genome. In combination, this project will make strides towards distinguishing the roles that plastic (physiological, behavioral) and fixed (genetic) factors play in complex, multifaceted traits such as fitness in a long-lived wild mammal.

In light of ongoing climate change and the dramatic shifts in the extent and persistence of sea ice in the Ross Sea, it is critical to understand how Weddell seals, Leptonychotes weddellii, a key apex predator, select and utilize foraging habitats. Recent advances in satellite-linked animal-borne conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) tags make it possible to simultaneously collect data on seal locations, their diving patterns, and the temperature and salinity profiles of the water columns they utilize. In other ecosystems, such data have revealed that marine predators selectively forage in areas where currents and fronts serve to locally concentrate prey resources, and that these conditions are required to sustain populations. Weddell seals will be studied in McMurdo Sound and at Terra Nova Bay, Ross Sea and will provide the first new data on Weddell seal winter diving behavior and habitat use in almost two decades. The relationship between an animal's diving behavior and physical habitat has enormous potential to enhance monitoring studies and to provide insight into how changes in ice conditions (due either to warming or the impact of large icebergs, such as B15) might impact individual time budgets and foraging success. The second thrust of this project is to use the profiles obtained from CTD seal tags to model the physical oceanography of this region. Current mathematical models of physical oceanographic processes in the Southern Ocean are directed at better understanding the role that it plays in global climate processes, and the linkages between physical and biological oceanographic processes. However, these efforts are limited by the scarcity of oceanographic data at high latitudes in the winter months; CTD tags deployed on animals will collect data at sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to improve data density. The project will contribute to two IPY endorsed initiatives: MEOP (Marine Mammals as Explorers of the Ocean Pole to Pole) and CAML (Census of Antarctic Marine Life). In addition, the highly visual nature of the data and analysis lends itself to public and educational display and outreach, particularly as they relate to global climate change, and we have collaborations with undergraduate and graduate training programs, the Seymour Marine Discovery Center, and the ARMADA program to foster these broader impacts. <br/>"

Understanding the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that regulate CLHEs is particularly important in species such as Weddell seals, as both reproduction and molt are associated with large reductions in foraging effort, and the timing and outcome of each appears linked with the other. The long-term mark recapture program on Erebus Bay's Weddell seals provides a unique opportunity to examine CLHEs in a known-history population. The proposed work will monitor physiological condition, pregnancy status, and behavior at various times throughout the year to determine if molt timing is influenced by prior reproductive outcome, and if it, in turn, influences future reproductive success. These data will then be used to address the demographic consequences of trade-offs between CLHEs in Weddell seals. The impact of environmental conditions and CLHE timing on population health will also be modeled so that results can be extended to other climates and species. <br/><br/>An improved understanding of the interactions between CLHEs and the environment is important in predicting the response of organisms from higher trophic levels to climate change.

Changes in the Arctic are even being felt in tropical regions through increased drought frequency and the intensity of water shortages.  These changes are continuing to occur at faster and faster rates and are recognized and amplified by the shrinking of the Arctic's sea ice, the thawing of permafrost and ancient carbon emissions into the atmosphere, declining terrestrial snow pack, shrub encroachment of the tundra, and more frequent and prolonged Arctic Vortex blasts of cold air and snow into the US, Europe and Scandinavia. One of the most important changes that is central to the entirety of Arctic change is how the water cycle is behaving now, how it interacts with sea ice and how weather events dictate transport of Arctic moisture and air into the lower latitudes and how low latitude moisture is transferred into the Arctic, dictating precipitation patterns and the delivery of freshwater around the north.  However, understanding how the Arctic water cycle is behaving over the entire calendar year, including during polar night with measurements and observations directly in the Arctic Basin during winter has been tremendously difficult as the region at times is almost as remote and inhospitable as the dark side of the moon.  The goal of this project is to test, measure and develop a completely new understanding of the real-time behavior of the Arctic water cycle continuously during 1.5 years as part of a major Arctic climate initiative involving land-based stations in coordination with simultaneous measurements aboard the Polarstern icebreaker.  <br/>These coordinated, real-time measurements will take place as the icebreaker drifts during fall, winter, spring and summer from the eastern Arctic, across the North Pole, along the east coast of Greenland and into the Barents Sea region. This project will take continuous measurements of water vapor and precipitation chemistry from Thule Air Base and Station Nord in Greenland and will be coordinated with measurements being taken on the ship and from other land-based stations in the Arctic.  This simultaneous data will be used in new visualization packages to display, share and observe how sea ice, atmospheric transport patterns, and weather patterns are dictating the distribution of water vapor and precipitation throughout the Arctic and into North America, Europe, Scandinavia and Eurasia. This project has several broader impacts, outreach and educational outcomes. By coordinating the measurements with the MOSAiC drift mission, it will contribute to the collective wisdom and understanding of the Arctic System, helping to develop a more holistic understanding of it?s behavior over an entire year, including the most unresolved period, polar night & winter.  The project also aims to educate students in classrooms during the observation period of what is discovered, including real-time depictions of water vapor and precipitation chemistry as storm systems develop and then propagate across the Arctic Basin and from the Arctic Basin into North America and Europe and from Europe and North America into the Arctic. The project includes training a postdoctoral scientist whereby she/he will become familiar with cutting edge technology and she/he will have opportunities to explore new venues of study by working with like-generation scientists from many of the Artic countries including partners from Germany, Sweden, Finland and Denmark.  The project also aims to develop a new set of Arctic Water Cycle and Arctic Change lectures to be offered through UArctic (http://education.uarctic.org/studies/courses) and posted for public access. These lectures will also be made available to the global community including the US, Finnish, Swedish, German, Danish and Norwegian societies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Preliminary research shows that sonomicrometry, which uses ultrasound to measure deformation, can be used successfully to measure strain in cartilage.  The research will advance our knowledge and understanding about the function of cartilage as a structural material in vertebrates by quantifying strain during in vitro and in vivo loading.  The study will also open multiple avenues of study on other biological materials that are not amenable to traditional strain analysis.<br/><br/>A broad range of chondrichthyan and chondrostean fishes that vary morphologically and kinematically in jaw and hyoid structures will be studied during feeding and ventilation behaviors with five aims. Morphological variation will be quantified using 3D geometric morphometrics.  Mechanical properties will be measured in vitro to provide baseline data to assess the function of cartilage as a structural material.  Strain in living fishes will be measured to examine cartilage performance as a skeletal element, providing a technique and baseline for measuring strain in non-bony skeletal elements.  Finite element analysis will be validated from in vivo species and used to predict strain in those species or structures that are not amenable to in vivo techniques.  Cartilage performance, behavior, and morphology will be analyzed phylogenetically to uncover ecological and evolutionary patterns.  A research fellow, two graduate students and at least seven undergraduate students will receive research training in all aspects of the study, from data collection to publication.

In order to discover how a supermassive black hole interacts with its galaxy, astronomers must peer into the very center of those galaxies in which the black hole is actively growing.  By observing those ""active"" galaxies nearest to us we can now view the region around their black holes in enough detail to advance our understanding of the nature of this relationship.  This project will achieve this through a comprehensive analysis of 40 local galaxies undergoing black hole growth.  The observational data from this survey will measure the location and motion of gas over a wide range in temperatures, as well as the stars, in the central regions of each of these galaxies.  The survey will be complemented by previously measured galaxies available in data archives, increasing the sample size to more than 90 local galaxies.  This large sample will support the first meaningful investigation of the relationship between the environment near the supermassive black hole with galaxy properties well outside of the central region, which will provide essential clues to how supermassive black holes and their galaxies interact.  The observed inflow and outflow of gas within the vicinity of the supermassive black holes will also complete our picture of galaxies experiencing black hole growth by measuring the gas flow on scales from beyond where the galaxies with black hole growth appear indistinguishable from those with no growth, to scales where current observations are beginning to probe structures associated with supermassive black hole growth.

Models attempt to reproduce the observed relationship, but due to a lack of observational measurements these models must make broad assumptions about the physical processes responsible.  It is only the nearest galaxies in which the black hole is actively growing that offer adequate spatial resolution to investigate the central regions relevant to black hole growth.  This program aims to provide the crucially needed observational measurements of the processes governing the growth of black holes and their galaxies.  This will be achieved through a comprehensive analysis of the central regions of 40 local galaxies undergoing black hole growth.  The observational data from this survey will measure the distribution and motions of the gas over a wide range in temperatures, as well as the stars, in the central 500 pc of each galaxy.  The survey sample will be complemented by previously measured galaxies available in data archives, increasing the sample size to more than 90 local galaxies.  This statistically significant sample will support the first robust investigation of trends between the central supermassive black hole environment on scales of hundreds down to tens of parsecs with fundamental galaxy properties, and will thus provide must needed observational constraints for galaxy evolution models.

Melting of the GrIS is increasing, delivering large amounts of freshwater to the Arctic Ocean. The nature and composition of microbial communities below the GrIS are not known, but recent studies have documented the presence of viable microbial communities in other subglacial environments and within the GrIS ice itself, indicating their potential importance for chemical weathering processes. This project will characterize GrIS? subglacial microbial communities to investigate the effect of microbes on lithospheric weathering and nutrient fluxes from the GrIS margin in West Greenland. The hypothesis is that the glacial thermal regime and bedrock lithology are the primary determinants of the subglacial bacterial communities, which in turn mediate nutrient release and weathering rates. Study sites in the Thule and Kangerlusuaq areas cover two major lithologies of West Greenland. The study combines state-of-the art microbiological, biogeochemical techniques, and datalogging of stream and climate parameters, to examine glacial meltwater. <br/><br/>It is anticipated that the melting of the GrIS will have large effects on global biogeochemical cycles, ocean ecology, and atmospheric CO2. GrIS subglacial microbes are anticipated to play an important role in mobilizing elements from the lithosphere. Data generated on the diversity of GrIS microbes (Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya) will provide an initial assessment of microbial richness and diversity in aquatic habitats beneath the GrIS. The primary objective is to examine the biodiversity and microbial contribution to geochemical processes and nutrient release, and this study will also provide insight into low temperature adaptation of life in and to a hitherto unexamined subglacial environment. A synergistic relationship with the WISSARD (Whillams Ice Stream Subglacial Access Research Drilling) project will provide the opportunity for a bipolar comparison of biodiversity beneath the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets. Providing data of chemical composition and fluxes of meltwater (particularly carbon, iron and trace nutrients) and sediments released by the GrIS will provide a framework to assess potential feedbacks in global biogeochemical models. Detailed measurements over two melting seasons will provide fundamental data towards a conceptual model of GrIS? subglacial microbial environments."

However, the key to understanding tundra soil processes is nitrogen (N), as both plant growth and decomposition are severely N limited. However, current models of tundra ecosystems and their responses to climate change assume that while N limits plant growth, C limits decomposition. In addition, N availability is strongly seasonal with relatively high availability early in the growing season followed by a pronounced crash. There is a need to understand the controls on this seasonality to predict Arctic System responses to climate change, but there are multiple questions that need answers: 1) What causes the seasonal nutrient crash? 2) Does microbial activity switch seasonally between C and N limitation? 3) How will a lengthening of the growing season alter overall ecosystem C and N dynamics, as a result of differential extension of the periods before and after the nutrient crash? 4) What will be the larger impacts of these patterns on the Arctic system? <br/><br/>Addressing these questions requires following plant and soil dynamics in a very tight time frame, coupling this understanding of the timing of C and N interactions to an enhanced mechanistic understanding of why the nutrient crash occurs, and then using transect sampling and ecosystem modeling to explore the large-scale implications of this seasonal crash. This proposed research will address our questions by: 1) Varying the length and timing of the growing season in the field by advancing snow melt and warming the ecosystem; 2) Establishing the fine scale seasonal time-courses of soil N availability, plant N content, leaf expansion, root growth and rhizodeposition, ecosystem respiration, microbial biomass and enzyme activity; 3) Conducting lab experiments to determine the extent to which microbial activity is limited by temperature, and C and N availability before and after the crash; 4) Determining how the timing of the nutrient crash and plant growth vary across a latitudinal transect; 5) Refining the Multiple Element Limitation model (MEL) that was developed for arctic ecosystems to better handle how plant and microbial systems respond to N limitation, and incorporating the specific drivers of the crash into MEL; 6) Testing the large-scale spatial and temporal effects of the seasonality of nutrient availability and how it may change in a warming Arctic with a lengthening growing season. <br/>This work will require intense mechanistic research focusing on transitions and transformations that occur over only a few weeks at most, but which have profound impacts on the tundra ecosystem. Researchers will scale this mechanistic work to the intermediate spatial scale by conducting transect measurements along a latitudinal transect to validate that patterns that occur locally are robust. They will scale to the whole Arctic system by integrating these mechanisms, and importantly, the N-effects on decomposition, into the MEL model that is designed to explore multiple limiting resource effects on ecosystem function. As an integrated package, this research will explore how the changing seasonal pattern that drives the crash in N availability in tundra soils will alter overall tundra C-cycling and its role as a source or sink of C and through this its role in the global climate system."

The candidates will be chosen from a pool of 60 applications, already received, representing 20 different nationalities, and will be evaluated on the basis of 1) professional experience (publications, NRF involvement, and conference papers); 2) their statement of interest that includes the relevance of their research to the conference topic; 3) their perspective on the social relevance of science, how to interpret and apply it.   In addition there is a strong dissemination plan through web-casts, position papers, and scientific papers, along with scheduled presentations to the Arctic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers."

Colloquy's purpose is to bring these specialists together to discuss issues of mutual interest and to promote improved and expanded collections, coordinated information systems, improved delivery of information and materials, and other services.    NSF funding supports production of the 1996 Colloquy proceedings which will include the text of presented papers, poster sessions, a summary of the business meeting, and a list of participants.  The published proceedings provide an invaluable and unique reference and reach a broader audience than does Colloquy itself.  They foster collaborative projects, report on the status of polar information preservation and dissemination, and aid in identifying information gaps.  The proceedings are important as the most comprehensive record available concerning polar information management."

Research in NW Greenland has produced four lines of evidence that climate change is affecting the High Arctic C cycle in ways we do not fully understand. First, soil organic C pools in polar semi-deserts, which occupy 1 x 106 km2 of the Arctic land surface, may be at least 6 greater than previous estimates, and ancient (>30 ky BP) and young soil C pools are present in the active layer. Second, CO2 ecosystem exchange measurements have consistently shown net C losses during the growing season; these C losses are, however, reversed under warmer and wetter conditions and with modest snow depth increases during the previous winter. In situ ecosystem respiration has been found to increase by 25 and 35% with experimental summer warming of 1.3 and 2.4C, respectively, but by 50% when the higher level of warming was combined with irrigation. Third, soil CO2 efflux measurements indicate that ancient soil C is being degraded by microbes before vegetation leaf-out. Losses are expected to continue throughout the growing season, but masked by high rates of plant respiration (recently-fixed C) during the mid-summer. Forth, interannual and temporal patterns of riverine DOC are not explained by simple differences in summer weather conditions. Articulating the magnitudes of CO2 and CH4 exchange and DOC export along with the ages of soil respired CO2 and DOC in soil solution and rivers, and determining the sensitivity of microbial degradation of different soil C pools to temperature and moisture will transform our understanding of environmental change, ecosystem function and C cycling in the Arctic. This study will address these questions: <br/><br/>1. How does the age (recently-fixed vs. older) of soil respired CO2 and DOC change over the course of a year, to what extent is this influenced by inter-annual variability in temperature and precipitation, and how does it correspond with the patterns of CO2 and CH4 fluxes? <br/><br/>2. To what extent do long-term experimental increases in temperature (+2 and + 4oC), and in water inputs (summer rain and winter snow) alter the ages, magnitudes, and patterns of C fluxes (CO2, CH4, and DOC)? <br/><br/>3. Are there differences in the extent of microbial degradation of young as opposed to older soil C pools and how sensitive are the degradation rates to changes in climate?"

The leading theme of the conference on ?gEmergence in Chemical Systems 2.0?h will be the search for chemistries that can lead to increasingly complex behaviors and emergent properties. <br/><br/>To computer scientists many aspects of complex systems come naturally, both by tradition and by training. For example, building on the continuing progress stemming all the way from Zuse and von Neumann, Chou and Reggia described a cellular automaton leading with close?]to?]certainty to self?]replicating structures regardless of a randomly chosen initial state. One of the goals of the conference is to facilitate chemical grounding of these concepts, which in turn will lead to experimental breakthroughs in designing new and understanding existing complex chemical and biochemical systems. <br/><br/>Sessions at the conferences are planned for bringing together scientists bridging computer science and chemistry in order to develop novel ideas for molecular computing and programming. The sessions will cover wide range of topics, from purely theoretical treatment of computing with chemical reaction networks in vitro and in vivo, through implemented examples from biocomputing and synthetic biology, to existing chemical systems in which implementation of local rules can lead to complex chemical synthesis and self?]assembly.

Impending climatic changes may greatly affect the role of these environments in the carbon cycle. Decomposition of organic matter occurs anaerobically in these wetlands. However, recent findings suggest that the terminal methanogenic step in northern wetlands is altered relative to more southerly systems, with acetate acting as a terminal product even though methane production continues via hydrogen utilization. If this phenomenon is ubiquitous, then acetate is not a significant intermediate in northern wetlands, but serves as a terminal product of decomposition; one that is ultimately degraded aerobically to CO2 rather than methane. Acetate accumulation in northern wetlands represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of anaerobic decomposition. It is possible that warming in the north will shift this process toward what occurs in more southerly wetlands. If so, then methane production in the north will increase greatly over what might occur from warming alone.<br/><br/>This work will test the hypothesis that northern wetlands do not support significant methanogenesis from acetate and that acetate formation and accumulation is an important terminal step during anaerobic degradation of organic matter. This phenomenon is being investigated by a multidisciplinary team that will utilize field and laboratory investigations and microbiological, molecular biology, geochemical, pedological, and stable isotope approaches.<br/><br/>The objectives of the project are: <br/>1) assess the ubiquity of the acetate-accumulating phenomenon by examining acetate concentrations and production rates, geochemical conditions, and by applying isotopic and molecular techniques to a variety of northern wetland types representative of the major circumpolar arctic, subarctic and northern boreal environments; <br/>2) Provide a temporal framework for determining variations in controls on methanogenic pathways and acetate cycling by conducting seasonal studies; <br/>3) determine the effects of physical and chemical parameters on terminal decomposition using laboratory manipulations of incubation conditions; <br/>4) determine if the bacterial populations are distinct compared to other wetlands and other anaerobic habitats.<br/><br/>Incubation assays, radiotracer analyses, stable isotopes and natural radiocarbon abundances will be used to address pathways of decomposition in field and laboratory experiments. Molecular approaches including PCR-DGGE and hybridization probing will be used to determine bacterial diversity and population structure.<br/><br/>A demonstration that biochemical pathways of methane formation in these wetlands are unique compared to their more southerly counterparts, has tremendous implications for our ability to predict the what the role of these wetlands will be in contributing methane to the global atmosphere and in their ability to degrade stored carbon. Acetate may serve as a primary organic end product, which would thus constitute a separate terminal decomposition pathway occurring simultaneously with methanogenesis. The multi-disciplinary study proposed here will delineate the important details of these processes and will serve to demonstrate their spatial significance.<br/>"

The purpose is to explore lessons learned from such research toward producing a report of best practices for integrating the social sciences with the biophysical sciences, mathematics, and engineering for sustainability science. The workshop explores what works, what doesn't work and why in order to engage these leaders in questions of how to best mentor emerging integrative scientists, to identify the key technologies which are critical to enabling integrative sustainability science and to provide structured guidance on how to integrate the social sciences in sustainability research and education. These best practices are directed at diverse audiences ranging from NSF and other funding program decision makers to researchers and education experts engaged in sustainability programs.<br/><br/>Sustainability science encompasses a myriad range of issues and processes that involve diverse aspects of the natural world and the societies that are part of it. It is only through an understanding of these latter phenomena that likely solutions will be derived. Moreover, the approaches to sustainability science have to address the multitude of worldviews and values that comprise the roots of the many challenges we currently face. To date, no meeting has occurred in the Americas to clearly articulate what has become an overwhelming call to find effective and powerful ways to incorporate the social sciences, and an understanding of social dynamics, into sustainability science. <br/><br/>To achieve sustainability, decision makers must learn to integrate knowledge and methods from the natural sciences, engineering, and the social sciences. Solutions are neither purely technical nor socio-economic, but involve bringing together best practices from all fields. This workshop is a step toward learning how to do the necessary integration."

One approach (``bag of words'') compiles simple statistics on the image brightness patterns and recognizes by correlating these statistics, via learning, with the imaged objects. It cannot exploit important information on the image's spatial layout. Another approach, perceptual organization (PO), computes a distinctive, structural description of the image contents and recognizes based on this. Researchers agree that PO is a crucial early stage of recognition--and that its results are unreliable. (Images compress the 3D world and are ambiguous; PO cannot eliminate the ambiguity since it has no high-level knowledge of what the image is ``about.'') This leads to a fundamental dilemma: How can a recognition system use the result of PO if it cannot be trusted?<br/><br/>To exploit perceptual organizations without succumbing to their unreliability, this project uses a strategy that averages over all possible organizations weighted by their probability, instead of computing a single, ``most likely'' image description. This strategy is applied to diverse tasks such as matching images by the shapes of the objects within; recognizing articulated objects such as people and animals; tracking objects through video; and computing stable perceptual organizations. The project also studies the integration of this approach with older ones into a flexible and capable recognition system. The result will be new techniques for the analysis, manipulation, and search of images.  The methods developed will be integrated in the curriculum and disseminated to researchers, and the software will be made publicly available.<br/><br/>"

This volcanologic, petrologic, and geochemical study of Darwin volcano is designed to test competing hypotheses for the growth of Galapagos-type shield volcanoes and their geochemical variations. The origin of their distinct ""overturned soup plate"" morphology is not merely a provincial issue: Galapagos-type shields may be characteristic of many seamounts and extraterrestrial volcanoes. Little is known of Darwin volcano, but several reconnaissance specimens from the lowermost flanks indicate that it is mostly made up of basalts with isotopic compositions are between those of lavas erupted from mid-oceanic ridges and those erupted from hotspots. Despite their isotopic character, the same lavas are rich in incompatible elements, more typical of ocean-island basalts. Darwin volcano was chosen for this study because although it remains virtually unstudied, it is situated between the two well-studied volcanoes of Alcedo and Wolf on Isabela Island. Alcedo and Wolf volcanoes represent two end members in the western Galapagos with respect to geochemical variation, elevation, shape, and caldera depth, and the study of Darwin volcano will allow for testing and refinement of models that predict the origin of these diverse geochemical systems and volcano morphologies.<br/><br/>The goals of this project seek insights into the fundamental processes of ocean-island magmatism. These include: 1) documentation of the eruptive processes and the chronology, distribution and volume of eruptions that have constructed Darwin volcano; 2) determination of the petrologic and geochemical variation of Darwin's lavas in order to document the processes involved with the generation, storage, and eruption of magmas; and 3) a comparison of Darwin volcano with other well-studied western Galapagos volcanoes in order test the hypothesis that the magma supply rate to each volcano is the dominant control not only of the geochemical variation of lavas but also each volcanoes unique size, shape and caldera morphology.<br/>"

The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) network has collected data on phenology, plant growth, community composition and ecosystem properties as part of a greater effort to study environmental arctic change. The network, started in early 1990?s, has played a key role in advancing knowledge related to the likely impacts of a warmer arctic through the use of experimentally warmed and un-manipulated plots (i.e., the controls) across a range of sites and ecosystems that span the major vegetation types of the Arctic. While of great value, most ITEX measurements are labor intensive and time consuming, which limit the frequency and spatial extent of sampling. Recent advances in sensor technology hold the promise to allow sampling of surrogates of these manual measurements rapidly and over larger areas. This work will continue the ITEX AON observations and initiate a suite of related, non-intrusive measurements using robotic sensor platforms (networked infomechanical systems, NIMS). These new measurements will enable scaling of measurements to the regional level by linking to existing 1 km2 sample grids and satellite imagery. These data are urgently needed to improve our capacity to monitor the impacts of changing tundra vegetation on the arctic system. This work should improve our understanding of the exchange of carbon and water across the land atmosphere interface and provide information on forage quality for herbivores."
