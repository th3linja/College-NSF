Recent reintroduction of some species allows for an examination of their role in the ecosystem, potential for conflict with humans, and possible strategies for future coexistence of humans and predators. This project will use sea otters in Southeast Alaska as a model system, combining ecology, economics, and Alaskan Native traditional knowledge to learn more about the role of marine predators in coastal sustainability. Between the mid-1700s and 1900, sea otters were hunted to extinction in Southeast Alaska for their highly valuable fur. In the 1960s, these animals were reintroduced in the region, and their population has grown from roughly 400 to more than 25,000 individuals. The recovery of sea otters in Southeast Alaska provides an opportunity to understand their ecological role in coastal ecosystems, while simultaneously evaluating their interactions with people who depend on coastal resources for their livelihood. Because otters eat shellfish, fishermen and people who harvest shellfish have growing concerns that the increase in sea otters is affecting their livelihood and food resources. At the same time, hunting pressure on sea otters has intensified from coastal Alaskan Natives who can legally harvest sea otters for their fur. The project will involve collaboration with Alaska Native communities and elders. In addition, it will support a team of scientists that includes undergraduate researchers, graduate students, two postdoctoral scholars, and two junior faculty members. One of the graduate students is from a group underrepresented in science, and the investigators plan to build on their track record of recruiting and retaining students from programs for Alaskan Natives. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to document the role of apex predators and environmental drivers on changes in nearshore marine resources, ecosystems, and humans using an interdisciplinary approach that integrates ecological studies, traditional knowledge interviews, and ecosystem services quantification and valuation. This research examines changes in the marine environment over a period of time in which sea otters were extinct and then recolonized. The absence and then expansion of sea otters into different areas over time allows for a space-for-time substitution in which the longer-term effects of sea otters can be seen in areas occupied longer. Analyses of historical data provide an opportunity to describe changes in kelp distribution and abundance and subsistence harvests over the last 30-100 years. Quantification and valuation of ecosystem services from sea otters, including seagrass, kelp, and fish, will provide information on the potential benefits of sea otter recolonization. The integration of ecological, anthropological and economic approaches will lead to a better understanding of the reciprocal feedbacks between humans, apex predators and environmental drivers. Collaborations with Alaska Native communities throughout the project include consultation with community members and tribal elders about project goals and results, with the ultimate goal of informing resource management to improve the sustainability of rural coastal communities and nearshore ecosystems."

A Gap Analysis performed for the Initiative identified the following as needs for Alaskan fisheries industries: 1) grow career awareness; 2) develop career pathways; 3) improve access to employment; 4) educate Alaskans for fisheries, seafood, and maritime employment; and 5) improve industry engagement and accountability. This project will develop a semester intensive program to increase the labor pool available for aquaculture facilities, while supporting student employment opportunities following a short educational intervention. This model of offering short, intensive programs that support gains in knowledge and relevant skills may apply to other aspects of the Fisheries Technology program, such as fisheries management, as well as other university programs that educate technicians. All seven of the aquaculture associations in Alaska, accounting for 25 hatcheries, have offered space, time, and mentorship to support this proposal. This inclusive collaboration for technician training in aquaculture is unprecedented in Alaska.<br/><br/>The University of Alaska Southeast Fisheries Technology program will offer a hands-on, semester-intensive program for entry level aquaculture/hatchery technicians. During this semester-long program, students will take 12 industry endorsed university credits over a four-month period that will give them the knowledge and skills needed to start work in the fisheries industry. This semester-intensive program was designed in response to a needs assessment completed by members from 16 hatchery organizations, which defined the need for hands-on, short-duration education programs in basic aquaculture education. This program will include basic aquaculture techniques used in Alaska salmon hatcheries, hatchery design and function, species biology, production processes, skiff operation, and outboard engine troubleshooting. The program will be based out of Sitka, Alaska, which is the headquarters of a regional Aquaculture Association, three unique hatcheries, and the University of Alaska Sitka campus. Students will complete an internship during the semester, to reinforce what they have learned, and will visit at least two other facilities around the state, thus exposing them to a variety of operations and explore life at remote sites. Graduates from this program will have a solid knowledge base and skill set that many salmon enhancement sectors need for entry-level technicians and will gain the experience working alongside professionals in the industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This rapid glacial recession has important implications for coastal watershed hydrology and biogeochemistry because the loss of glacier ice decreases hydrologic storage and dramatically alters catchment landcover by exposing new land to the process of primary succession. The ecological development of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems following deglaciation has been explored extensively, however there has been very little research on how landcover change will alter material delivery into and through the river network to coastal estuaries.  This project will fill this critical knowledge gap by evaluating how glacial recession is altering hydrologic and biogeochemical processes in coastal watersheds in southeastern Alaska.  In particular, our research will develop a comprehensive understanding of how the speciation, fate and transport of riverine nutrients and dissolved organic matter (DOM) will be altered by ongoing glacial retreat.  Weekly and storm sampling combined with continuous discharge measurements will provide the first detailed and complete comparison of nutrient and DOM yields between paired glacial and non-glacial watersheds. Continuous measurements of discharge, oxygen, temperature and turbidity will be used to quantify the effects of glacial meltwater on hydrologic and physical parameters. Experimental approaches (laboratory and field-scale) combined with longitudinal surveys and stream tracers will be used to elucidate the fate of nutrients and DOM during downstream transport. Finally, longitudinal synoptics and source sampling will also be used to access the primary landscape sources of nutrients and carbon to the stream. Ultimately, project findings will provide new insights into how land-to-ocean fluxes of organic and inorganic nutrients are being altered by glacial recession along the GOA and in other glaciated coastal regions.<br/>The project will provide laboratory and field research opportunities for undergraduates at the University of Alaska Southeast (UAS), a small, undergraduate university with a high (16%) enrollment of native Alaskan students.  Additionally, the project will provide training for one graduate student and one post-doctoral researcher.  The integration of undergraduate students in this research project will provide a framework for students and researchers to cooperatively investigate important linkages among climate, landcover change, and hydrological and biogeochemical processes in coastal watersheds.  In addition, the project will strengthen an existing partnership between scientists at UAS and naturalists at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center who will work collaboratively to incorporate project results into an interpretive display at the center.  The Mendenhall Glacier is the most visited glacier in the United States and hosts over 300,000 visitors each year and thus provides a unique and effective opportunity for public outreach and education related to the findings of this project. Finally, a science educator from Montgomery County, VA will partake in field work during one of the summers. The science educator will bring their experience into the local classrooms and share their experience with their peers.<br/>"

The project is using Alaska's changing landscape as an outdoor laboratory for introducing fifteen 6-12th grade teachers and their students to the scientific methods used to observe ongoing adjustments of glacial, fluvial, and coastal systems to climate change. Teachers are creating their own geoscience hypotheses that will be tested with their students back in the classroom. EDGE university faculty will begin tracking and evaluating participant teachers and students to assess the effectiveness of this project as a means of achieving a ten-year goal of increased enrollment in UAS Environmental Science and University of Alaska Fairbanks Geoscience Departments.  <br/>The EDGE year of activities includes a two-week UAS Earth Systems Science Field Methods and GIS course that puts 15 teachers into outdoor environments with university faculty. Teachers learn to observe Earth processes and devise testable hypotheses about how change is occurring. Teachers collect appropriate GPS data for a project they design and develop an understanding of GIS concepts as they use their spatial data in the production of project maps. Late in the summer, middle and high-school students receive university credit by participating in one week of UAS courses in GPS and GIS.  As students and teachers return to their communities and science classrooms, they carry out student geoscience projects that focus on local, observable geologic processes.  Utilizing long-term community observations, students are adding time sequence observations to their project.  During the fall semester, teachers are simultaneously enrolled in a 15-week UAS web-based distance course in Earth System Science Essentials so that they can receive additional geologic content that they in turn can disseminate to their students. University faculty guide teachers and students through the GIS projects. The EDGE project maintains and loans GPS receivers and laptop computers loaded with Arcview 3.x GIS software to teachers and classrooms throughout the region.  <br/>"

It is driven by poorly understood processes occurring at the ice-ocean interface, such as subglacial discharge into the ocean, turbulent plume dynamics, submarine melting, and iceberg calving. These processes are (1) inherently interdisciplinary, requiring expertise in both glaciology and oceanography and (2) difficult to observe, requiring innovative field techniques and careful site selection. This project will address the relationship between subglacial discharge, turbulent plume dynamics, and submarine melting through a comprehensive field campaign at LeConte Glacier, Alaska, supplemented by a state-of-the-art modeling effort. The field site is ideal because it spans a wide range of forcings on daily to seasonal time scales and because the near-terminus fjord environment is accessible year round.  A successful project will provide a unique data set and improved models for projecting contributions to future sea level rise.<br/><br/>This interdisciplinary project, at the interface of the the fields of glaciology and oceanography, provides support for an early-career principal investigator (PI) (Amundson) from a predominantly undergraduate institution (University of Alaska Southeast) and an additional early career PI at University of Oregon.  More mature PIs at Oregon State University and University of Alaska Fairbanks Campus will mentor the younger team members, promoting workforce development.  Additional workforce development will be promoted through interaction with high school students and at the participating universities.  The team of PIs will entrain select students from a local Alaska high school to participate in aspects of the field work and engage with the school to integrate their observations into the curriculum.  The project will also provide support for the training two graduate students and a post-doctoral scholar.  The associated mentoring plan is very good.  Outreach to the general public will be enhanced by leveraging the PIs? home institutions? activities.  The PIs will continue established interactions with the National Park Service and the US Forest Service.  These include public lectures, as well as training for interpretive rangers who can reach a broad cross-cut of the public.  Finally, they will develop a brochure concerning their work to further enhance their public outreach.<br/><br/>This project will develop a parameterization of a plume, driven by subglacial discharge, as it interacts with the face of a marine-terminating glacier.  This is a goal that has been endorsed by the international community.  It will be accomplished by conducting three intensive field campaigns to<br/>i. sample the upwelling plume directly with manned and autonomous vessels,<br/>ii. measure the downstream impact of the plume on near-terminus fjord circulation,<br/>iii. determine subglacial discharge and submarine melt rates, and<br/>iv. survey associated changes in glacier terminus dynamics.<br/>Subglacial discharge and ambient water properties in the proglacial fjord will be monitored throughout the project in order to provide<br/>i. important context for the intensive field campaigns, and<br/>ii. a range of parameter space to be explored by a turbulence-resolving hydrodynamic plume model.<br/>Data from the intensive field campaigns will be used to validate the plume model, which will then be used to explore the wider range of parameter space that is provided by long-term measurements. The latter will allow investigation of the impact of submarine melting on glacier dynamics over seasonal timescales."

Importantly, documenting these linguistic practices can increase the scientific understanding of factors important to health and wellbeing, including illness preventions and remedies, healing practices, and perspectives on how to live a healthy life. Native American and Alaska Native communities show a well-documented, major gap in wellbeing measures when comparing these communities and non-Native Americans. This award will fund a workshop that brings together community members and other researchers and experts from diverse backgrounds to explore these issues surrounding wellbeing and to present their findings. Better health outcomes for Alaska Native communities serve the national interest by reducing health inequities. Project activities will broaden participation by underrepresented groups of all ages in the social sciences, including involving high school and university students, some of whom will be trained in video documentation. The conference presentations will be available to the general public and other academics by sharing the recordings online. <br/><br/>Sharing Our Knowledge workshops have been held since 1993, bringing together Native and non-Native Tlingit researchers to present their work to a diverse audience. These workshops have been an important bridge between academics and indigenous community members. The Tlingit people have traditionally inhabited coastal Alaska and the contiguous interior of Yukon and British Columbia, and Tlingit is a severely threatened language, with 80 fluent first language speakers and many avid second language learners. The Native American Languages Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990, enacted into policy the recognition of the unique status and importance of Native American languages. These workshops serve as a forum conducive to the production, sharing and documentation of Tlingit knowledge and language. The 10th Sharing Our Knowledge workshop will occur in 2017 and the focus on wellbeing will encompass research presentations on the physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, and economic wellbeing for individuals and communities. Workshop discussions include the multi-generational impacts on Tlingit health due to colonization and the documentation of the wellness teachings deeply embedded in the Tlingit language. Impressionistically speaking, for those who have witnessed the renaissance of Alaska Native traditions and languages, such cultural affinities seem to have improved the wellness of Alaska Natives. Workshop results will also add to the growing literature regarding the positive interactions between indigenous languages and cultures and wellbeing. The workshop will have broad impact, and will offer opportunities to cross traditional academic boundaries including health, biology, traditional ecological knowledge, archaeology, linguistics, museum studies, cultural anthropology, education, ethnohistory, art, music, and indigenous law. Project results will be archived and accessible at the Sealaska Heritage Institute Archive and at the Alaska State Library Historical Collections Archives."

The DOC/TDN analyzer will replace an aging, non-functional instrument that is located off campus and is owned by the USFS. Acquisition of this instrument will allow the investigators to reinvigorate stream biogeochemistry research efforts aimed at understanding the biophysical impacts of glacial change on coastal watersheds in southeast Alaska, facilitate access to the instrument by outside users, and enhance  undergraduate training. In particular, the instrument will strengthen the research training opportunities for undergraduates in Environmental Science as well as provide the opportunity to recruit and train members of two groups (rural and Alaska Native students) that are traditionally highly under-represented in the Environmental Sciences.<br/><br/>The DOC/TDN analyzer allows for rapid and precise measurement of concentrations of DOC and TDN. Research applications include: 1) determining how climatically-driven changes in snow/rainfall regimes that influence the timing and magnitude of glacial runoff are driving stream water DOC and nutrient fluxes in the region, 2) quantifying the relationship between disinfection byproduct formation, DOC concentrations and precipitation event size in watersheds that currently or may provide drinking water in rural watersheds, 3) testing the use of DOC as a proxy for methylmercury concentrations in forested and wetland-dominated watersheds, and 4) determining how seasonal changes in the movement of water from soils to streams controls the production, speciation and timing of lateral carbon export from forested ecosystems."

During the last decades GOA glaciers have generally thinned and retreated and hence precipitation stored in the glaciers as snow and ice has been released augmenting streamflow and freshwater influx to the Gulf of Alaska. Glaciers draining to the GOA are highly sensitive to climate warming and mass loss rates are expected to increase. It is hypothesized that runoff from glaciers will initially increase by more than 50% as wastage accelerates, but then will reach a turning point upon which runoff will decrease as the glaciers shrink and partly disappear. Hence, the changes in the hydrological cycles due to glacier wastage are substantially larger than expected changes in any other component of the water budget in this region.<br/><br/>The research will quantify these changes in runoff. A glacier runoff model is used to simulate the current magnitude and timing of runoff from glaciers that drain to the Gulf of Alaska and project how glacial runoff along the Gulf of Alaska will change by 2100 in response to future climate scenarios in Alaska downscaled by a high resolution regional climate model. Further, potential changes to the biogeochemical fluxes into freshwater and marine ecosystems associated with the projected changes in glacier runoff are assessed. Results provide regional scale estimates of glacier runoff changes and associated impacts on biogeochemical fluxes for the GOA. A modeling strategy is developed that can be used to evaluate glacier runoff changes and hydrologic ?tipping points? in other heavily glacierized regions. Moreover, the downscaled climate scenarios we develop will be available for other impact studies. Visualization products of the results are made available to the Mendenhall Glacier visitor center, which is visited by approximately 350,000 people each year."

What record of daily functional language will learners and scientists look to in the future? The Tlingit language is a branch of the Na-Dene language family indigenous to Southeast Alaska, the interior of British Columbia and Yukon Territory, Canada. Of the 45 languages in the Nuclear Na-Dene language family, there are two branches; Tlingit is one; all the others arise from the other branch. There are approximately 200 Tlingit birth-speakers, most in their 70s and older. During the last two years, this group has suffered a 13% mortality rate, a rate which will accelerate since the population of birth-speakers is aging. Recordings of Tlingit common, everyday conversation, are scant but crucially important for language documentation; everyday conversation is the means of functional communication. We need a record of conversation for analysis, learning, and preservation.<br/><br/>With support from the National Science Foundation, Drs. Alice Taff, Richard L. Dauenhauer and the project team of Tlingit faculty and students at the University of Alaska Southeast will produce a video record of spontaneous Tlingit conversation with bilingual, time-aligned annotations, and make the results available to scientists and the language learning community. A second result will be increased Tlingit language and literacy skills, knowledge of linguistic concepts, and experience in language documentation and archiving for members of the Tlingit language community, highly active in its language revitalization efforts. To make recordings, birth speakers will be videoed talking in groups of two or more while carrying out common daily activities. Then teams of birth-speakers and students will transcribe the conversations in Tlingit and broadly translate them into English. The videos will be post-produced as QuickTime subtitled movies for use by the regional and international Tlingit language-learning community. The team will catalogue the recordings with their transcription/translations and archive them for discovery and access for scientific analysis. Community and scientific collaboration will inform the project at all stages of work so that as many different people, dialects, topics of interest, and grammatical forms as possible are documented. Advances in information technology will be exploited in all phases of the project.<br/><br/>"

They also constitute an important, but poorly understood ecosystem. Improving knowledge of glacier biogeochemistry is particularly important as they are among the environments most sensitive to climate warming. Most notably, glacier melting is accelerating due to rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns and the deposition of black carbon, which darkens glacier surfaces enhancing their absorption of light and heat. Glacier ecosystems were recently identified as a significant source of ancient, yet highly bioavailable dissolved organic carbon to downstream aquatic ecosystems. This finding runs counter to logical perceptions of age-reactivity relationships, in which the least reactive material withstands degradation the longest and is therefore the oldest. The remnants of ancient peatlands and forests since overrun by glaciers have been invoked as a source of this ancient, labile organic carbon. Preliminary results upon which this study is based, challenge the peatland/forest source hypothesis, indicating instead that glacier organic carbon is predominantly from aerosol deposition and enters glaciers in a pre-aged form. This study will determine the contribution to the glacial organic carbon pool made by fossil fuel derived aerosols, verify whether this organic carbon is indeed ancient and labile, and quantify the extent to which it is being exported to downstream ecosystems.<br/><br/>Today, around 60% of organic aerosols are derived from anthropogenic activities, indicating that organic deposition has also increased dramatically since the industrial revolution. Therefore, if the organics found on, within and being exported from Gulf of Alaska glaciers are from aerosols, the glacier ecosystem structure we observe today is fed by the waste products of industrial activity occurring thousands of miles away. If this is the case, then the organic carbon which is exported to ecosystems downstream of glaciers would also be of anthropogenic origin, suggesting these receiving ecosystems are also transformed relative to their pre-industrial status. As deposition of combustion products is a global phenomenon, all ecosystems may be receiving this ancient, labile carbon subsidy. In warmer ecosystems, the labile carbon windfall is presumably rapidly processed and its signal is lost. In frigid glacier environments, these inputs stand out, making glaciers sentinel ecosystems for the detection and study of anthropogenic deposition. Although the study focuses upon glaciers along the Gulf of Alaska, findings will be relevant to any ecosystem receiving depositional inputs. The project provides a highly interdisciplinary and collaborative research environment from which the undergraduates from under-represented groups in science, a masters student, and a postdoctoral researcher will all benefit. The collaboration extends beyond the funded US scientists to include German colleagues supported by the Max Planck Institute's Marine Geochemistry Group. This international component expands the possibilities for knowledge transfer and provides the US-based researchers access to unique, state-of-the-art analytical facilities. Results will be disseminated to the public through the U.S. Forest Service Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center in Juneau, providing an opportunity for public outreach on the effects of climate change on glaciers."

The fast pace of these changes has prompted concern because boreal forests make up about a third of all forests worldwide, contain almost half of the world's stored carbon, and have been historically stable with black spruce dominating this landscape for the past 6,000 years. Warming of 2-8 C is projected by the end of the century and the emergence of a new fire regime threatens to disrupt this forest ecosystem. For example, in some regions of interior Alaska, the fire return interval has decreased to 10-50 years, causing shifts from black spruce to deciduous trees and grasses. Changes in the climate and fire regime are also expected to affect global carbon cycling since fires and thawing of frozen soils (permafrost) may release large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. This research will incorporate field studies and computer simulations to determine how fire frequency and climate change affect shifts between vegetation types (e.g. switch from conifer to grasses) and long term carbon storage in this vast and under-studied region. The study will train graduate students and involve Native American high school students from the Rural Alaska Honors Institute (RAHI) in field work. The investigators will collaborate with Your World Rocks (YWR), a nonprofit organization of female scientists and engineers dedicated to promoting science education in elementary schools. They will develop hands-on activities focusing on climate change, forests, and fire and conduct free hands-on activities in elementary schools in the greater Portland/Vancouver metro area, with a particular focus on underserved Title 1 schools. <br/><br/>The fast pace of climate warming and an increase in fire frequency over the past few decades in northern latitudes has raised concerns about major shifts in vegetation and the long-term ability of ecosystems to capture and store carbon. Boreal forest ecosystems account for about 33% of all forests worldwide and contain about 45% of the world's carbon stocks, with the majority (~85%) stored belowground. For the past 6,000 years, black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) has been the dominant species over a large proportion of this landscape, exhibiting substantial resilience to changes in climate. However, unprecedented warming (causing earlier snowmelt, permafrost thawing, and longer growing seasons) and the emergence of a new fire regime over the past 60 years threatens to disrupt the existing dominance by black spruce and release globally significant amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. The goal of this research is to quantify the potential for large-scale changes in carbon (C) sink strength, C stocks, and vegetation in boreal forests due to climate change and repeated wildfires by integrating mechanistic field and lab work with dynamic, spatially explicit landscape modeling. Working in central Alaska, the investigators will: 1) determine how fire frequency and climate change affect successional trajectories and above- and belowground C cycling, and 2) assess how the mechanisms that cause tipping points between vegetation types (i.e. conifer, hardwood, graminoid) and C sequestration (i.e. sink, source) vary spatially and temporally. To achieve these objectives, the investiagors will empirically measure above- and belowground C stocks, productivity, heterotrophic respiration, soil temperature and moisture content, and active layer thickness in the field and quantify C mineralization using laboratory soil incubations. They will also develop and validate a physically based permafrost/hydrology module for a widely-used, high resolution landscape simulation model (LANDIS-II) to forecast long-term dynamics of species composition and C source/sink status given projected changes in climate (including thawing permafrost) and fire. The work will improve our understanding of how C cycling and species composition in boreal forests will respond to climate change and disturbances at the fine spatial scales critical to accurately project the future of the boreal forest."

The first currently has about 150 speakers who learned the language from birth, and the other currently has just nine.  Dr. Richard Dauenhauer and Dr. Alice Taff will undertake three projects addressing the different needs of these two communities, sharing techniques and insights along the way.  The Deg Xinag project will prepare for publication an existing 4.5-hour corpus of Deg Xinag stories and personal histories, recorded from seven speakers in 2002-3.  Despite this recent vintage, five of the speakers have since passed on. There is very little time remaining to translate these stories and make them available.  This task will be performed with the help of younger community members (many learning their heritage language), who will work with elder native speakers. For Tlingit, a pilot project to document spontaneous conversation will engage young adult Tlingit learners to make video recordings of fluent elders holding conversations, then work with the elders to transcribe and translate the audio. A two-hour-long bilingual video, with accompanying text, is expected. The third project, also for Tlingit, will tap the knowledge of an 80-year old speaker, who is the only living person who knows what is in a collection of Tlingit audio recordings from the past 40 years. All of the above materials will be archived at the Alaska Native Language Center and also the Anvik Museum, Anvik, AK.<br/>.<br/><br/>This work can only be undertaken now, while the speakers remain in good health. The younger generations are trying to gain competence in their heritage languages, and the materials produced will greatly increase their ability to become fluent speakers themselves. The project will engage two generations in language documentation and revitalization by educating language community members in best practices for language documentation. The local university will be engaged with the language community in new ways, to the benefit of both. A wealth of cultural and linguistic data will be maintained by these efforts. <br/><br/>"

NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, and integrates the co-production of knowledge. This award fulfills part of that aim. <br/><br/>Climate change is increasing vulnerability of Arctic urban communities to natural hazards such as unstable permafrost, wildfire, and rain-in-winter events. These hazards put residents and property at risk and impose economic costs, and households, businesses, and governments must adapt to these interacting hazards. This research is developing detailed maps showing how the occurrence of these three natural hazards has evolved simultaneously in the Municipality of Anchorage and the Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, and Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada over the past several decades, and how they might change over the next 40 years. The interdisciplinary research team of economists; permafrost, fire, weather, climate, and environmental scientists; and policy experts conducts transdisciplinary research on Arctic natural hazards and their impacts on the natural and built environments and society. The research team works closely with local governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Indigenous groups, insurance companies, and residents to co-produce knowledge on the costs, risks, and actions taken to mitigate and adapt to these hazards. The team and stakeholders collaborate to determine optimal ways to measure the effects of hazards on society and the built environment, identify trade-offs and interactions, develop a multiple-hazard risk assessment, and generate options for future adaptive planning.  This project is one of the first to include effects of climate change on private as well as public infrastructure, a gap which has limited the understanding of effects of climate change in Alaska.  Results provide a framework that other Arctic communities can use to assess risks and reduce economic damages due to climate change and provide examples to increase resilience.  <br/><br/>Research activities over four years include: (1) spatial modeling and mapping of natural hazards and their interactions; (2) gathering data to assess perceived risks, values at risk, and adaptation costs with interviews, property owner surveys, and citizen science; (3) economic modeling of costs and risks; and (4) developing in a series of scenario planning workshops an adaptive policy framework that can be used to adapt to and mitigate multiple hazards and reduce future costs and risks. The research helps partner communities make better-informed decisions regarding how and where to build and manage public and private infrastructure and finance public services. This framework can be used by other Arctic communities to assess risks and reduce economic damages due to climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The links between terrestrial and marine ecosystems are especially tight in the coastal temperate rainforests of Alaska and British Columbia. Abundant rainfall moves nutrients held in glaciers, dense forests, and wetlands to estuaries and fjords, supporting productive fisheries and robust marine mammal populations. This region includes the largest remaining old-growth forests in North America; has among the highest rates of glacier melt on the planet; supports billion-dollar fishing and tourism industries; and is home to tens of thousands of people who depend on natural resources for their livelihoods. Because the movement of fresh water and nutrients plays a key role in these linked ecosystems, climate-driven changes in this flow may impact coastal ecosystems and the human communities that depend on them. The Coastal Rainforest Margins Research Network is an international research collaborative that will facilitate a better understanding of these processes and impacts. This Network will establish a core community of scientists and stakeholders to function as an information and guidance resource for ecosystem management and community adaptation into the future. An improved understanding of this ecosystem will help build resilience in local communities and ecosystems in a warming and increasingly variable climate. Additionally, it will provide a foundation for understanding climate-driven changes within coastal temperate rainforests and coastal margins worldwide.<br/><br/>The Coastal Rainforest Margins Research Network will be composed of research communities organized within key disciplines, including hydrology, forest ecology, soil science, biogeochemistry, and near-shore marine ecology. These disciplinary communities will address critical information gaps, develop regional collaborations, and synthesize knowledge regarding water, carbon, and nutrient fluxes in a landscape where intense transformations and rapid transfers between terrestrial and freshwater environments control the delivery of these materials to the coastal ocean. The Network will achieve these goals through three main activities: 1) structured information exchanges among Network participants, including regular teleconferences, research webinars, field site visits, web-hosted meetings, and annual multi-day workshops that bring the entire Network together; 2) creation of working groups to develop data collection, management and sharing protocols; and 3) development of outreach products useful to Network members as well as policy-makers and resource managers."

This research has the potential to generate data that could provide insights into the social organization of the prehistoric Eskimo, the development of complex societies along the Bering Sea coast, and better explain human adaptations to the arctic environment. There are no longer any intact archaeological sites on St. Lawrence Island, which means that museum materials are the sole source of information on an island adaptation that persisted for over two millennia.

The polar regions of our planet are home to many dynamic physical processes. Although the word ""glacier"" may invoke connotations of stoic and slow-moving mountains of ice whose changes are indistinguishable to the eye, this is not always the case. Among the most active regions of glaciological activity are the massive coastal fjords in Greenland. Rivers of ice which are 5-10 km wide and up to 1 km deep are rapidly flowing towards the ocean. At the end of these glaciers, where the ice meets the sea, icebergs are constantly breaking off or ""calving"" into the ocean. Approximately 30-50% of all ice discharged into the ocean occurs through calving, as opposed to other mechanisms such as melting. Unfortunately, the physical processes which control calving are not well understood. One possible influence is the presence of an ice mlange, which is a floating layer of icebergs and sea ice extending many kilometers away from the front of the glacier. The mlange is essentially a large-scale, quasi-two dimensional granular material, which can potentially have a large impact on calving rates and our ability to detect iceberg calving. This collaborative project aims to determine the correct physical description of ice mlange mechanics, as well as its influences on iceberg calving. This is accomplished through an interdisciplinary combination of satellite imagery, small-scale laboratory experiments, and theoretical modeling. By bringing together ideas in condensed matter physics to study large-scale glaciological processes, the project sheds new light on the underlying mechanisms which shape the polar regions of our planet. <br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The primary goal of this project is to characterize the rheology of ice mlange, a closely-packed granular material composed of icebergs and sea ice that is found in fjords throughout Greenland. Ice mlange is unique among granular materials in that it contains exceptionally large clasts (10's to 100's of meters in scale in all directions), is constrained to flow in a quasi-two-dimensional setting, and floats in its own melt. Seasonal variations in ice mlange motion and extent are well-correlated with seasonal variations in iceberg calving rates, suggesting that ice mlange is an important control on outlet glacier and ice sheet stability. The dynamics, energetics, and oceanographic consequences of ice mlange are essentially unexplored. The research team's aim is to study ice mlange by combining analysis of field observations with laboratory experiments and numerical modeling. Satellite imagery, along with previously collected time lapse photography and terrestrial radar data, is analyzed to produce ice mlange velocity fields and quantify iceberg-size distributions. This work provides new insights into ice mlange kinematics and composition, and serves as a benchmark for laboratory and numerical modeling experiments. In addition, experiments are conducted in which synthetic icebergs in a water tank are pushed by a model terminus. These experiments study jamming of particles that model icebergs during and between calving events to investigate stress transmission through ice mlange. Finally, numerical experiments are performed in which ice mlange is simulated using discrete particle and continuum models adapted from previous work on granular materials. The model rheology can be adjusted to find a description of ice mlange that is consistent with field observations and laboratory experiments."
