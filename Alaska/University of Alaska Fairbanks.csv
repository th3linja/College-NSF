This program allows up to ten undergraduate students to perform research in the areas of Computer Science, Supercomputing, and Visualization. This minority outreach program is open to students primarily from minority institutions, with preference given to minority applicants.  Recruitment is done by onsite recruiting at target institutions.  ARSC focus our efforts on these groups, as they have traditionally been underrepresented in the science and research fields.  With intern input, each participant is assigned a project related to their field of study, to be performed under the direct supervision of a faculty member or senior staff. Students spend an average of 10 weeks in Fairbanks where they live in campus housing with undergraduate interns from other groups and work an average of 40 hours per week to complete their projects.  Under the oversight of the Program Manager, they work independently and within research groups, live in housing with other interns, gain new work and study skills and establish a stronger sense of self-assurance. The program manager ensures that each participant fully understands their project and what is expected of them. Through this program ARSC strives to promote and further interests in many areas of arctic research.  The program also serves to develop positive research and life skills while increasing involvement of various minorities in science and research. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

MODIS is one of the instruments on board the Terra satellite launched into polar orbit last year; another MODIS will accompany the Aqua satellite into orbit next December.  These wide range remote sensing instruments, which span a wide spectral range from the visible to thermal infrared wavelengths, are designed to observe and monitor global changes on land, sea, and within the atmosphere.  MODIS uses a Direct Access System to provide a direct-to-user communication link.  This system relies upon distributed receiving stations to gather real-time data across their reception masks.  The UAF is the ideal location for receiving, processing, archiving, using, and distributing MODIS data across the high northern latitudes.  From Fairbanks a reception mask will cover all the land and sea territories of Alaska and span a considerable portion of the whole Arctic Region.  The MODIS Science Team has developed and validated a suite of algorithms to confidently extract various surface and atmospheric properties from the satellite measurements.  When combined with additional properties, these data should provide a powerful means of approaching issues of scientific, social, and economic importance to the state.  The University of Alaska Fairbanks MODIS station will have four main objectives.  These are:  (1) to expand capabilities for researchers to contribute in solving arctic global change problems; (2) to enhance educational opportunities in remote sensing and satellite image analysis; (3) to assist state and federal agencies, as well as Alaskan Native Corporations, in inventorying and monitoring activity on land (volcanic eruptions, forest fires, atmospheric pollutants, etc.) and sea (oil spills, ocean productivity, sea ice migration, etc.); and (4) provide expedient, real-time, and low-cost access to MODIS data to the private sector in order to encourage development and expansion of remote sensing industry in Alaska (capable of marketing, processing, and distributing satellite image information to their customers).<br/>"

There is tremendous variation in the structures of AFPs both between and within these groups of organisms. The most active known AFPs are found in insects, where they typically assist freeze-susceptible insects to avoid freezing by inhibiting inoculative freezing initiated by external ice across the cuticle, and by promoting supercooling by inhibiting potential internal ice nucleators. A few AFP-producing insects are freeze-tolerant, able to survive freezing, and in these the AFPs apparently function as a cryoprotectant to protect from freeze damage, however the mechanism is unknown.  Two types of insect AFPs have been characterized. One is found in the beetles Dendroides and Tenebrio. The other is from the spruce budworm caterpillar. Interestingly, although AFPs have been found in many insects, they have not previously been described in Alaskan or Arctic insects until recently when AFPs were found in 7 of 12 insects screened from near Fairbanks, Alaska. This presents an opportunity to study AFPs in insects that are exposed to extremely cold winter temperatures.<br/><br/>        There are four aspects to the proposed study. One of these will concentrate on the role of AFPs in the cold tolerance of overwintering larvae of the beetle Cucujus clavipes. Previous studies on populations of this species from Indiana showed the presence of AFPs in these larvae which have a lower lethal temperature of -20 to -25 C. In the late 1970's this species from near Fairbanks, Alaska was shown to have a lower lethal temperature of ""-55 C or less"".  Both the Indiana and Alaskan populations produce the Dendroides/Tenebrio-type AFPs.  In this study, comparisons of the role of AFPs in populations from Indiana and Alaska (from near Fairbanks, just south of the Arctic Circle, and from near Wiseman, above the Arctic Circle and near the limit of treeline). Thus, one can study this species over a tremendous latitudinal range, from a temperate climate to the interior of Alaska, one of the coldest climates in North America.<br/><br/>        A second component of the study aims to purify and characterize a new type of AFP.  The stinkbug Elasmostethus interstinctus is an AFP-producing insect common in interior Alaska.  Molecular probes have demonstrated that the bug's AFP is different from either the Dendroides/Tenebrio-type or the spruce budworm-type AEPs. The abundance, ease of collection, large size and exposure to very cold temperatures in this insect make it an excellent system in which to identify a new insect AFP.<br/><br/>        The third aspect of this study is to screen the hemolymph of insects for thermal hysteresis activity characteristic of AFPs. This will identify which species have AFPs. Insects will be collected from two sites in the taiga of interior Alaska, near Fairbanks and near Wiseman, and especially from a true tundra site in the vicinity of the Institute of Arctic Biology, University of Alaska, Fairbanks, Toolik Field Station. These sites provide a wide diversity of insects.  AFPs have not been previously investigated in insects from these regions, and no aspect of the cold tolerance of insects from Toolik has previously been studied. This screen should identify new species of AFP-producing insects from very cold environments, some of which may provide excellent model systems for future study.<br/><br/>        In addition, microhabitat temperatures and overwintering survival of selected insect species will be determined. These are important to collaborate laboratory determinations of various physiological parameters. Thus this study will integrate classical physiological ecology with biochemistry and molecular studies of antifreeze proteins in insects from these severe arctic and subarctic environments.<br/><br/>        Since their initial discovery in Antarctic fish the study of AFPs in both animals and plants has burgeoned, and today scores of laboratories study these proteins.  In particular insect AFPs have tremendous potential for both basic and applied work since they are the most active AFPs known.  Numerous possible uses of AFPs exist, especially in cryopreservation of biomedical materials, food preservation and agriculture.  Therefore, the study of AFPs from such highly cold adapted insects may yield information of great value.<br/><br/>"

The value of these meetings has been demonstrated by the enhanced collaboration that has emerged through improved communication and coordination in all areas of Arctic research. ASSW 2016, and associated side meetings and events, will be convened in Fairbanks, Alaska in March, 2016. ASSW will be held in conjunction with the Arctic Observing Summit (AOS), the Arctic Council Senior Arctic Officials (SAO) Meeting, and other local events and side meetings; it is anticipated to attract 800-1000 people from over 20 countries. The AOS is a biennial forum to discuss, coordinate and plan implementation of integrated long-term observations of Arctic change. With a focus on effective responses to a rapidly changing Arctic, the summit involves a range of entities that collect or use Arctic observations, including basic research, mission-oriented, and stakeholder communities. Participants include academia, government agencies and Arctic residents, industry and non-governmental organizations. AOS 2016 is co-sponsored by the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC), the International Study of Arctic Change (ISAC) and the Arctic Council's Sustaining Arctic  Observations Network (SAON). This grant supports a combination of activities revolving around the ASSW, AOS and a joint forum hosted by the conference organizers and the SAO meeting organizers. The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) as host institution is responsible for meeting organization, including logistics, meeting rooms and related needs. Funds from this grant support activities associated in particular with efforts by the research community, in collaboration with stakeholder organizations and government agencies, to define and implement a coordinated Arctic observing system. Support is primarily directed to the various components of the ASSW and AOS during the meetings themselves, and will include support for some key attendees. <br/><br/>This award supports a process by which broader input from the research community and stakeholders on key aspects of defining and implementing an Arctic observing system is gathered, synthesized and reframed in terms of specific recommendations and action items. The latter input is then collectively discussed and refined by participants to generate an action plan and specific agenda that will be taken up by organizations active in the Arctic and/or represented at the summit. The advantage of hosting a single large event where a large fraction of all Arctic-relevant organizations meet and interact is to improve communications, enhance planning, and efficiently coordinate collaborations. These benefits create the foundation to advance and evaluate new ideas and research agendas as well as promoting discovery and transformational science.

Sikuliaq is used by scientists in the U.S. and by the international oceanographic community through the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS). This Ship Operations proposal requests funding necessary to support NSF-funded R/V Sikuliaq operations in CY2018, which currently amount to 153 days out of a total of 190 operational days at sea. These NSF-funded ship days are in support of 10 research projects for CY2018.community<br/><br/>The overarching intellectual and technical merit of R/V Sikuliaq is in supporting the advancement of NSF peer-reviewed oceanographic research and education programs. In particular, the twelve cruises planned for CY2018 supported by this Ship Operations proposal provide an excellent opportunity to display Sikuliaq's capability in oceanographic observation, collection, and measurement of samples and data accomplished on a global scale through operation of this state-of-the-art vessel. The intellectual and technical merit of this proposal is further amplified by the combined intellectual and technical merit of research projects undertaken by scientists onboard. During 2018, Sikuliaq will support ten NSF-sponsored research cruises in the eastern Pacific and Arctic Oceans to conduct research in physical oceanography, marine ecology, marine chemistry, and ocean observing. NSF sponsored research (including Ocean Observing Initiative research) will account for 71% (176 days) of Sikuliaq's work this year. The remainder of the work will be supported by the Navy (41 days, 17%), and the North Pacific Research Board (28 days, 11%). Each program contributes its own unique intellectual and technical merit, which are supported by Sikuliaq operations.<br/><br/>The proposed work constitutes strongly collaborative, multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional use of the shared-use research and education infrastructure. CY2018 will be Sikuliaq's first season working in Arctic waters under the Polar Code regulations, which will provide a good test of the vessel's capabilities to support missions in the Arctic while adhering to the strict Polar Code rules. As a charter member of UNOLS, UAF is actively involved in coordinating research vessel operations with scientists and funding agencies so shipboard capabilities can best meet the current and anticipated research needs of the entire community. The spectrum of research projects enabled by UAF's operation of Sikuliaq achieves far-reaching broader impacts through the operation and maintenance of infrastructure. This effort is critical to the advancement of training and learning, scientific and technological understanding, and informing policy makers. UAF's proposed operation of Sikuliaq enables institutional programs from across the nation and internationally to directly implement NSF's mission to promote advancement of science, engineering and education for the benefit of the nation. As a shared-use resource for ocean scientists, Sikuliaq similarly contributes to the education, training and outreach missions of those scientists and their home institutions. Finally, as part of the broader impacts in operating Sikuliaq, we regularly engage with Alaska Native communities and subsistence hunters (e.g., the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission) to ensure the productive coordination between these groups, the scientific community, and R/V Sikuliaq.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Permafrost affects both human-built and natural systems, such as roads, railroads, pipelines, water quality and ecosystem function and restoration. Climate change and expanded resource development in the high latitudes (both hemispheres) has been the catalyst for recent renewed interest in permafrost science and engineering. The main conference theme is ?Permafrost on a Warming Planet: Impacts on Ecosystems, Infrastructure and Climate?. This conference also covers a wide breadth of themes, from social science to environmental to engineering; all aspects of permafrost will be addressed, including planetary permafrost. One of the scientific synthesis goals is to bring a wide variety of disciplines together to address questions of permafrost landscape evolution under past, present and future climates. The conference will bring together the worldwide community of permafrost researchers to share their results and ideas in ways that could lead to new advances in our understanding of permafrost and its role in polar regions, influencing geology, biology, hydrology and related systems. The Ninth International Conference on Permafrost (NICOP) will take place on the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus during the week of June 29-July 3 (Sunday through Thursday), 2008. NICOP marks the 25th anniversary of the Fourth International Conference on Permafrost (FICOP) and the formation of the International Permafrost Association (IPA); both took place at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks in the summer of 1983.Conference sessions will address permafrost problems facing northern communities. NICOP will be the first opportunity for many of the 200 members of the Permafrost Young Researchers Network to meet and develop their own plans for this new generation of permafrost researchers. Conference results will support many of the findings and recommendations of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission report on permafrost, the ACIA and ICARP II reports, and the National Academy of Sciences report ?Toward an Integrated Arctic Observing System?. The five-day technical program will consist of plenary presentations, simultaneous topical and special sessions, poster sessions, and field trips to view permafrost conditions and related construction activities. Several permafrost courses and workshops are planned in conjunction with this Conference and will be available to teachers, students and the public. Funds through this proposal will assist in developing high-quality proceedings for posterity and providing travel assistance for invited speakers, students, and young investigators.

Mentoring of teachers has been shown to be very effective in retention. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts . The best practices used will insure that K-12 students will receive the very best of hands-on science, mathematics and technology education. The project employs numerous minority (especially Alaska Native) and women scientists and mathematicians, who will serve as excellent role models for K-12 students. By establishing a university course to prepare the students to interact in meaningful ways with K-12 students, the project will develop the needed infrastructure to continue this program. The project will disseminate the results through presentations at the AAAS Arctic Division meetings, local and national conferences, journals, and through the website.

The urgent need to preserve and translate the Alaska Native languages derives from a number of problems in the social and natural sciences, as well as educational, political, and economic problems caused by powerful forces that are shaping events in the Arctic at the turn of the millennium. This project will develop a succinct statement of the most important needs in translation and preservation of the Native Languages and what role computational linguistics can play in addressing these problems. This project will support a workshop involving parties interested in this problem. The workshop is planned for May 19-22, 1999 at the new International Arctic Research Center (IARC) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF). The workshop has been preceded by organizational and steering committee activities. Following the workshop a report will be produced and disseminated. This project is jointly supported with a number of organizations in the State of Alaska. <br/>"

The application of the research specifically is to study with high temporal resolution the evolution of the white-light morphology of the artificial radio-induced aurora. Ownership of the HAARP facility was transferred from the US Air Force to the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) in August, 2015. During campaigns, significant expenditures for fuel and personnel are required. Large start-up costs make HAARP experiments largely inaccessible to individual researchers unless multiple experiments and funding sources can be bundled together during a campaign of up to two-week duration. Based on recent pledged support from sponsors, UAF plans to conduct a limited experiment campaign in February 2017; this schedule is unflexible and consequently, the RAPID management of the award would enable the schedule to be enhanced with additional experiments thus utilizing the HAARP facility more effectively. Broader impacts will be maximized by encouraging public participation in various roles.<br/><br/>This project is a singular opportunity for researchers to conduct ionosphere modification experiments by taking advantage of efficiencies gained through bundling onto the campaign already planned for February. The primary experimental objective of this project is to measure time-dependent artificial airglow or ""aurora"" morphology with a sensitive white-light video camera capable of 30 frames per second temporal resolution. The secondary experimental objective is to test Arctic HF radio propagation paths using community and amateur radio (ham) participation. Both experiment objectives are highly relevant to active areas of space physics and Arctic radio communications research. Ionosphere radio modification is an important experimental technique for investigating: 1) plasma processes difficult or impossible to replicate in a laboratory, 2) the near-earth space environment, 3) radio propagation properties, and 4) natural processes such as aurora that transfer energy into the upper atmosphere. The primary and secondary objectives are 1) to measure the white-light artificial aurora morphology with high temporal resolution and 2) to test possible HF radio propagation paths in the Arctic. Both experiment objectives align with formerly active areas of research at HAARP prior to the suspension of operations."

This course includes both inter-campus collaborative hands-on laboratory and team project experiences. <br/><br/>The project is addressing the needs of three very different populations of students: (i) the traditional engineering students attending the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) main campus; (ii) students enrolled in the pre-engineering program at the University of Alaska Southeast (UAS) campus in Juneau; and (iii) students attending an Alaska Native serving community campus in rural Alaska. The delivery of an exemplary, financially responsible, engineering education in each of these communities has unique challenges, including cost and availability of an instructor, cost and availability of laboratory facilities, diversity of students' prior knowledge and cultural experiences, and variety of students' learning styles. <br/><br/>The project has three goals:<br/>Goal 1: Deliver a hands-on electrical engineering lab course to place-bound pre-engineering and Alaska Native serving community campuses in Alaska synchronously with the identical course delivered face-to-face on the main engineering campus at UAF. <br/>Goal 2: Restructure the lab component of the class to require inter-campus collaboration between the students through data sharing and discussions in the hands-on laboratories and team projects. <br/>Goal 3: Develop expertise in Engineering Education through detailed assessment and evaluation of the engagement and learning of students, both those participating face-to-face and via distance. <br/><br/>The team is studying the effectiveness of inter-campus collaboration to improve both retention and academic achievement across three Alaska communities. This is the first hands-on engineering lab course delivered by distance in Alaska; therefore, it is transforming the way engineering education is delivered in the state. <br/><br/><br/>BROADER SIGNIFICANCE <br/>The project is directly impacting the availability of engineering curriculum for the geographically dispersed student population in Alaska, especially the Alaska Native communities in rural Alaska. The project is creating a successful ""blueprint"" for development and assessment of distance-delivered laboratory-based courses, particularly for inter-campus collaborations. The effort is transforming the educational experience of the often-isolated, place-bound students in rural communities - through building their social capital and connecting them to a larger learning community. This inter-campus collaboration is generating a deeper discussion of variations and outliers in measurements and providing experiences that are more reflective of the global work environment."

Different methods used for radiometric dating apply to different materials and vary in the timescales over which they are accurate.  This fellowship enables an early career researcher at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and a graduate student trainee to collaborate with researchers at the Oregon State University.  While there they will use state-of-the art equipment to determine the age of young volcanic rocks from Alaska's Aleutian and Wrangell arcs.  Precise geological dating of young volcanic rocks is important in understanding the eruptive history of volcanoes in Alaska, volcanic and seismic hazards assessment, and tectonic reconstructions.  The project will investigate how the chemistry and environments of the samples and the sensitivity and precision of available measurement instrumentation contribute to the uncertainties in determining the age of young volcanic rocks.  The research will enable the development of new methods to accurately date young volcanic rocks and lead to improved research capabilities for the PI at his home institution.  The training and collaborations accrued through this project will enrich the careers of the participating faculty and students.   <br/><br/>Technical Description <br/><br/>This award will allow researchers at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks to collaborate with the Oregon State University Argon Geochronology Laboratory (OSU-AGL) to produce high-precision 40Ar/39Ar geochronology data to determine the age of volcanic rocks and products from Alaska?s Aleutian and Wrangell arcs. Accurate dating of these young volcanic rocks is hampered by uncertainties arising from radiochemistry within the samples, limitations on the available instrumentation, and mass fractionation processes in the magma chamber.  This project overcomes some of these difficulties through systematic experimentation of the volcanic rocks using the noble gas multi-collector mass spectrometer and software available at the OSU-AGL.  The researchers will select samples from a broad range of tectonic-magmatic settings, for example, monogenic cones, intraplate, arc-transform magmatism, and arc magmatism, to investigate potential mass fractionation influences.  The PI and his graduate student will extend their expertise with the use of a noble gas mass spectrometer by peak-hopping on a single detector and will be trained in the operation of modern instrumentation with the potential to enhance the research instrumentation and capabilities at their home institution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wildlife, such as moose, snowshoe hares, and now beavers, have exploited the increase in their shrub habitat by extending their range from the boreal forest into the arctic tundra. Inundation from beaver ponds causes permafrost thaw, potentially altering streams and surrounding ecosystems more rapidly than climate change alone. To this end, satellite imagery from the last half-century will be used to detect the formation of beaver ponds and their subsequent impacts to the tundra environment.  This project also uses satellite imagery to map the current habitat of beavers, moose, and snowshoe hares in the arctic tundra. This will be combined with models of future arctic climate and tundra vegetation to predict the future distribution of beavers and their impacts, as well as moose and snowshoe hares. Dr. Tape and a postdoctoral researcher will spend six months working on this project at Northern Arizona University with Dr. Scott Goetz and Dr. Logan Berner, who are experts in satellite image analysis. This is a valuable opportunity for Dr. Tape to work alongside these scientists and to develop useful spatial analysis tools to advance his career. Dr. Tape and his post-doctoral researcher will return to the University of Alaska Fairbanks with newfound expertise to bolster their careers and the research capacity in Alaska. <br/><br/><br/>Technical<br/>Existing vegetation, permafrost, and freshwater model projections understandably do not include beavers, because they are not yet recognized as part of the arctic tundra environment. Given the profound impacts of beavers in other ecosystems, the arrival of beavers and their dramatic modifications to the tundra environment may signal a benchmark in the trajectory of arctic riparian and freshwater ecosystems that has gone unnoticed. This project uses a novel method involving remote sensing of beaver pond formation. The scientific goals of the proposed work are: (1) to use remote sensing to quantify beaver shrub habitat requirements at known beaver sites prior to their colonization using Landsat vegetation indices; (2) to identify potential beaver habitat across the uncolonized North Slope of Alaska by combining shrub habitat requirements for beavers and regional Landsat imagery; (3) to evaluate impacts of beaver colonization on vegetation and surface water using satellite imagery; and (4) to map future moose and snowshoe hare habitat on the North Slope of Alaska by combining known shrub habitat requirements and regional Landsat imagery. The project offers an exciting opportunity for a postdoctoral researcher and Dr. Tape to develop their tools for spatial analysis of time series satellite imagery with oversight from colleagues Dr. Scott Goetz and Dr. Logan Berner at Northern Arizona University. Dr. Tape and his postdoctoral researcher will return to the University of Alaska Fairbanks, increasing the visibility, perception, and research capacity in Alaska.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such increased access affects not only the natural environment, but also impacts the lives of Indigenous and local residents. Thawing permafrost and coastal erosion affect infrastructure, communities, and ecosystems. The enormity of the region exacerbates security and safety concerns created by lack of infrastructure, insufficient emergency response capabilities, and scarce monitoring. Evolving Arctic conditions also present significant challenges for scientists and policy makers, such as insufficient observations and monitoring to build more robust climate models. This project supports a conference in Fairbanks, Alaska, to scope the science drivers for the creation of a US High Arctic Research Center (HARC) located at or near Oliktok Point in Alaska. Intended outcomes of the conference include well-defined science questions to be answered by access to the Arctic that HARC would create, the potential role for the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies, and a list of stakeholders. This workshop will engage Arctic experts and knowledge holders to develop scientific justification for evaluating the potential establishment of another permanent research facility in the Arctic. The pursuit of a US High Arctic Research Center will formalize relationships and communication pathways among scientists, Arctic communities, industry, state and federal agencies, and international partners.<br/><br/>This workshop will engage Arctic domain science experts to articulate the research needs and scientific priorities for a permanent, year-round research station in the US High Arctic where restricted air space, coastal access, and existing infrastructure will improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of basic science and operations. Experts from disciplines across Earth sciences will be brought together to help define the science drivers and expand interdisciplinary collaborations to create broader impacts to basic research including better forecasting, enhanced modeling, and improved understanding of environmental change and its ramifications. The workshop will identify the key science missions and technical activities that would be essential to realize this proposition. While the increase in human interaction with the Arctic environment is primarily due to the increase in natural resource exploitation and the changing global climate, these activities also create cultural, development, and socioeconomic changes and opportunities. The pursuit and establishment of a multifaceted research, education, and outreach program, as will be developed through this project, may ensure that the knowledge gained by the University of Alaska Fairbanks and its HARC partners will be developed with, and transferred, to Arctic stakeholders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will be held during a two-week period, usually in late July and early August. The school will follow the format that has been established over the last six years. The two weeks will be spent in a series of lectures, field trips, and experiments, at the space physics research facilities located around interior Alaska. The school has started out each year with a week in the Fairbanks area with lectures at the Geophysical Institute, and tours of the Geophysical Institute, the Poker Flat Research Range, and the HIgh Power Auroral Stimulation (HIPAS) ionospheric heating facility. Student experiments scheduled for the facilities in the Fairbanks area have been carried out during the first week of the school. For the second week of the school, the group has relocated to the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) Ionospheric Observatory at Gakona, Alaska, for additional tours and experiments. The experiments conducted during the school cover a variety of topics, including (1) observations of noctilucent clouds, (2) generation of extreme low frequency and very low frequency radio waves using the HAARP transmitter to modulate the auroral electrojet, and (3) generation of field-aligned density irregularities. Several students have presented their experiment results at major scientific workshops, and journal articles have been published on the results from PARS summer school experiments. The primary motivation for the summer school is to provide an opportunity for students to study the upper atmosphere and ionosphere at polar latitudes with practical experience built into the learning process. There is a need for more trained scientists and engineers with knowledge of the special effects that occur in the ionosphere at high latitudes. The summer school is provided to attract students with exceptional talent to become more familiar with this exciting area of study. The summer school has brought student-faculty pairs from universities around the country to Alaska."

During the relatively brief (10,000 yr) history of the boreal forest in its current location, it has experienced radical changes in climate, vegetation, and fauna. Warming during the last 30 years has been associated with warming and melting of permafrost, changes in growth rates of dominant trees, increased area burned, insect outbreaks, and changes in vertebrate populations.  The causal links among these changes and their implications for the functioning of the boreal forest and the people who inhabit this region are not completely understood. The structure and functioning of the boreal forest determines and is influenced by its disturbance regime.  Fire, insect outbreaks, timber harvest, and flooding are important disturbances.  The extent and distribution of these disturbances are changing rapidly as climate warms, human populations grow, and socioeconomic conditions change.  To understand the current and future structure, diversity, and functioning of the boreal forest, it is important to understand how climate and disturbance interact and the implications of these interactions for ecological, economic, and cultural sustainability of the boreal forest.  To promote an understanding of climate-disturbance interactions in the boreal forest, the Bonanza Creek Long Term Ecological Research Program and the International Boreal Forest Research Association (IBFRA) have organized an international science conference on ""Climate-Disturbance Interactions in Boreal Forest Ecosystems"" to be held in Fairbanks, Alaska 3 - 7 May 2004 at the Fairbanks Princess Riverside Lodge.  The objectives of the 12th IBFRA Conference are: (1) to present and discuss the current scientific understanding of climate-disturbance interactions in the circumboreal region; (2) to discuss the unique ecological, economic, and social conditions that influence management decisions regarding disturbance, climate change impacts, and adaptation to climate change in the boreal region; (3) to bring a circumpolar perspective to research initiatives; and (4) to foster cooperation and an exchange of ideas among countries in the circumpolar boreal forest.  <br/>"

However, during the 2014-2015 school year, 37.6% of Alaska Native students dropped out of Alaskan public schools (education.alaska.gov/stats/). At the college level, Alaska Native students are underrepresented in University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) STEM majors. GeoFORCE Alaska is a four-year, field-based, summer geoscience program that has successfully raised graduation rates in rural Alaskan high schools and increased the diversity of students pursuing college degrees in STEM fields. The program applies the cohort model, leading the same group of high school students on 10-day field academies during four consecutive summers. The curriculum builds across the program, giving students a chance to apply the scientific method to relevant questions at spectacular geological locations. Now in its fifth year, GeoFORCE Alaska has served 54 students in two cohorts. 76% of these students identify as Alaska Native, reflecting the demographics of their communities. A stable base of industry sponsors funds one summer academy per year, limiting recruitment of a new cohort of 8th and 9th grade students to once every four years. By funding participant support for a second summer academy during 2018 and 2019, this expansion grant will double the frequency of recruiting and expand the region served, thereby offering the GeoFORCE experience to interested applicants in remote communities throughout northern and interior Alaska. Based on results thus far, doubling the number of GeoFORCE participants will raise high school graduation rates in the school districts served and increase the number and diversity of rural Alaskan students attending college and pursuing STEM degrees.<br/><br/>Part 2<br/>Launched in 2012 by the University of Alaska Fairbanks in partnership with the longstanding GeoFORCE Texas program and adapted for a cohort of rural, predominantly Alaska Native students, GeoFORCE Alaska employs best educational practices as established by research in order to engage and prepare future STEM majors. Through a combination of active learning, high academic standards, mentorship and teamwork, participants acquire habits that promote academic success and gain the confidence to pursue STEM degrees. The goals of GeoFORCE Alaska are: 1) Promote high school graduation; 2) Increase the number of rural students attending college and pursuing STEM degrees; and 3) Diversify Alaska?s technical workforce. Program success in achieving these goals is assessed via qualitative metrics, including an annual survey of participants, and quantitative metrics, including participant retention, comparison of participants? high school graduation rates with rates for their school districts as a whole, and long-term tracking of college matriculation, persistence, majors, and degrees earned. <br/>The inaugural cohort of 18 students from the North Slope Borough completed the Fourth-Year Academy in summer 2015. 94% of these students graduated from high school and 72% are going to college. Of these, 85% chose STEM majors, and 38% will pursue undergraduate degrees in geoscience. A second cohort of 34 rising 9th and 10th graders entered the program in 2016. At the request of Alaska Native Regional Corporation sponsors, this cohort was recruited from both the Northwest Arctic and North Slope boroughs. On an exit survey following the 2016 First-Year Academy, 100% of participants indicated that they learned a lot, 97% made new friends, and 94% increased their interest in science. The success of the first two cohorts indicates that GeoFORCE Alaska is highly effective as a means of raising high school graduation rates in remote Alaskan villages and increasing the participation of rural, Alaska Native, and first-generation college students in STEM majors. An expansion grant will significantly increase the number of students and school districts served by the program over the next two years, with the goals of doubling the number of GeoFORCE alumni entering STEM majors by fall 2022 and attracting additional regional sponsors to sustain a biennial recruiting schedule.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The award is made to the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) for the construction of the Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV) based on the approval to proceed received from the National Science Board in March 2009.  Delivery of the vessel is anticipated in mid-2013 with science operations beginning in 2014.<br/><br/>Technical Description:  The 242-foot Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV) will be a multipurpose research ship that will dramatically improve access to Arctic waters and expand current scientific capabilities in the region.  It is designed specifically to operate in seasonal sea ice and open ocean waters near Alaska; including the Chukchi, Beaufort, and Bering Seas as well as the eastern Arctic.  To do so, the hull will be ice-strengthened to American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) ice classification standards.  The ARRV will provide a much needed, technologically-advanced oceanographic platform to enable multidisciplinary teams to conduct field research at the ice edge and in seasonal sea ice up to 3.9 feet thick.  The ARRV will have many advanced capabilities including next-generation science handling systems to improve safety and efficiency at sea, and a modern suite of satellite communications to link the ship to educational facilities ashore.  It is designed to have a minimal influence on its own environment, including low underwater radiated noise (URN) for fisheries and acoustics research, and reduced stack emissions to enable atmospheric research.  With twenty six dedicated science berths, the ARRV will be able to accommodate over 500 researchers and students annually and spend as many as 300 days at sea.  The anticipated operational lifetime of the ARRV is at least 30 years.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The Alaska coastline is longer than that of the contiguous forty eight states combined, and the area of its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is approximately two thirds of the total US EEZ.  The Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska sustain more than half of the total annual national fish catch. The area supports one of the most productive marine ecosystems in the world, as well as rich and varied marine mammal populations.<br/><br/>The Arctic region is changing rapidly.  Perennial sea ice has been estimated to be decreasing by about 9% per decade, potentially leading to a summer ice-free Arctic Ocean by the end of the century or even sooner.  In the summer of 2008 the Northwest Passage was open for the first time since satellite imagery has been taken.  Along with the significant ecosystem changes and impact on coastal communities, this change could impact national security and commerce by providing regular trade routes further into regions along the north coast of Alaska.  Opening this fragile area to commerce will heighten the importance of scientific research to understand the effects.<br/><br/>Scientific interest in the Arctic region is intensive and highly varied.  For example, dramatic changes in biological productivity have been predicted as a consequence of progressive warming, continuing ice recession, changing ocean currents, ocean acidification, and varying climatic conditions.  Changing Arctic climate may well be one of the critical drivers for climate change over the entire planet.  Besides biological and climatological changes, the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian areas are also subject to major seismic processes.  Extending our knowledge about subduction zones and the eruptive history of seafloor volcanoes would help predict the potential risk for devastating tsunamis.  All of these scientific missions and activities are of continuing interest and great importance not only to the U.S., but also to the economic and environmental welfare of the entire globe.<br/><br/>The Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV) will provide a safe and highly effective platform for scientific access to these remote and inhospitable areas that are of such great national and international importance.  The ARRV will replace the R/V ALPHA HELIX which was operated by the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.  When the vessel was retired from service in 2006 it was well past its expected 30-year service life.  The ARRV will be the first NSF-built ship since the 1980?s.  Committing to construction of this highly capable vessel represents a major NSF contribution to the International Polar Year legacy, advancement of US Arctic Policy, as well as the effort to better understand global issues, including climate change and ocean circulation.   <br/>"

The full ESF project is a collaboration of researchers from five countries, including the US, Canada, Russia, Greenland, and Finland.  These particular projects, which represent a portion of the US NSF contribution to the BOREAS effort, focus on the local and regional context and impacts of state sponsored and implemented resettlement programs, of indigenous and non-indigenous communities, in the Arctic in the 20th and 21st centuries.  <br/><br/>Using the tools of economic geography and population geography, the aim of Heleniak's  project will be to document and analyze changes in the spatial distribution of economic activity and settlements patterns across the circumpolar North. The project aims to be comparative, spatial, and temporal. A major component of this will be to examine the events of the past decade and a half in the Russian North against the situation in other northern regions. The breakup of the Soviet Union, transition of the Russian economy, and liberalization of society has had profound consequences for the Russian North as well as on relations among northern regions. A question is whether the Russian North is beginning to resemble other northern regions elsewhere or whether the past patterns of development and settlement will remain.<br/><br/>A major component upon which the analysis will be based will be a geodatabase of economic activity and population distribution across the North. Other geodatabases or GIS (geographic information systems) have been compiled on the Arctic or the North that emphasize changes in physical characteristics of northern regions, many emphasizing the impact of climatic change on these regions. The proposed geodatabase would emphasize the economic and human aspects of the circumpolar North and changes in these attributes.<br/><br/>The comparative analysis that the project is taking of the diverse circumpolar migration and resettlements movements will have relevance and intellectual merit for the community of academic researchers interested in circumpolar issues. The combination of the broad comparative approach proposed in this project, along with comparative approaches being undertaken in the other projects at other geographic scales will contribute significantly to our theoretical understanding.<br/><br/>The models of economic and population change developed in this project will have broader impact and relevance for other academics and policy makers dealing with circumpolar issues. The geodatabase of economic and demographic characteristics across the circumpolar North will be of value to both groups as climate change and other factors impact on the North in the decades ahead. In order to enhance these broader impacts, outreach efforts will be undertaken to ensure wide distribution of the data collected and analysis undertaken in the project.<br/><br/>Schweitzer will conduct research among the Residents of Shishmaref, Kivalina, Newtok, and many other coastal communities of Alaska facing erosion and, thus, the loss of their residential areas due to severe storm events and other consequences of a changing climate. The former residents and their descendants of Naukan and Chaplino in Chukotka and of King Island in Alaska preserve strong memories of being relocated almost 50 years ago. The indigenous residents many communities on the Chukchi Peninsula have experienced waves of expansion and contraction of their villages, be it due to the sedentarization of reindeer herders, the mass influx of Russians and other incomers, or their rapid out-migration since 1990. During the summer of 2005, the threat of the closure of an Air Force Base in the vicinity of Fairbanks spurred community protests and scenarios of economic and social decay. At the same time, a good portion of the non-indigenous population of Fairbanks is characterized by having arrived during or after the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in the mid-1970s, an event which serves as a dividing line between ""old settlers"" from ""new settlers"".<br/><br/>All of the cases mentioned above refer to past and future population movements triggered by outside forces, be they direct state intervention, market forces, or changes in the natural environment. All of them are also characterized by memories of past events and conditions, as well as by speculations about the future, in short by narrative ways of adapting to changing conditions. Notwithstanding these similarities, these and other examples are defined by a number of important differences. Most obviously, Alaska and Chukotka seem to represent two diametrically opposed experiences regarding the role of the state in population movements. While Chukotka has been the frequent recipient of Soviet and post-Soviet forms of social engineering, Alaska seems to have been relatively free from such interventions. A closer look, however, reveals that also in Alaska many small-scale communities have been closed or relocated, for a variety of different reasons. At the same time, large influxes of non-indigenous people occurred during economic boom periods, many of which were either initiated or regulated by the state.    <br/><br/>One of the most compelling reasons for conducting this research is that there is hardly any documentation of the diverse relocation phenomena which have characterized Alaska and rural Chukotka throughout the 20th century and into the 21st. The first goal of documenting what has happened and continues to happen is both of scholarly importance, as well as highly relevant to affected communities. The second goal of focusing on four or more case studies will, apart from providing more in-depth documentation, result in a better understanding of the factors which contribute to positive and negative effects of relocation events. This addresses important issues regarding the creation and re-creation of community identity and the importance of ""place"" in these processes. Another compelling reason for this project is its new, comparative approach. Yet another reason for this study is its emphasis on the people themselves. This project reaches beyond a general history of events and delves into their impacts and perceptions thereof.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

They will conduct an institutional ethnography - a comprehensive research project on women STEM faculty at UAF, focusing on how social institutions shape women's experiences as STEM faculty. The project seeks to get a clear picture of women STEM faculty so leaders among the faculty, staff, and administration can begin to brainstorm institutional changes that will transform UAF into a model of gender equity. UAF is unique; it is America's Arctic University, and is located in an extreme climate and remote locale. A comparatively small university, UAF has several internationally admired STEM programs. <br/><br/>The project will begin with a review of two previous studies of UAF, including the University of Alaska Faculty Opinion Survey (2003), and the Study of Faculty Work Life at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (2005). The latter was conducted by the UAF Faculty Senate Committee on the Status of Women and contains questions specific to women faculty. The second phase of the project is a comprehensive review of national data and analyses of women in the STEM disciplines and project reports of selected NSF ADVANCE projects. The third, and most time-intensive and resource-intensive phase of the project will generate new data specific to women STEM faculty at UAF. Both qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to gather data. Qualitative methods include focus groups with women STEM faculty, men STEM faculty, and assigned mentors of STEM faculty. Confidential interviews will be conducted with deans in STEM-based colleges, directors of STEM research units, women at UAF who were formerly STEM faculty members but who are now members of UAF administration, and non-retained women STEM faculty. Quantitative methods of gathering data on UAF women STEM faculty include analysis of institutional data gathered by UA Statewide, data kept by UAF's Office of Equal Employment Opportunity, and a climate survey of all STEM faculty at UAF. <br/><br/>Institutional merit:  The proposed project will allow the researchers to theorize how gender inequalities are structural and institutional in nature. The cutting edge approach of examining gender inequality as institutional will yield essential information for concurrent planning for institutional transformation. <br/>Broader impacts: Getting a clear picture of the status of women STEM faculty at UAF will allow planning for institutional transformation to take place. It is also anticipated that women STEM faculty will be more likely to choose UAF, to stay at UAF, and to become excellent teachers and researchers because the climate will be more equitable as a result of the proposed study. The participation of underrepresented groups, particularly women and Alaska Natives, will be broadened. The project is expected to generate much local and regional attention and interest."

This region is believed to be analogous to, but have a smaller influence than, the Tibetan plateau in terms of the possible feedback between climate change and tectonics.   The coring program has been designed to provide temporal resolution at sub-decadal to millennial time scales and sufficient spatial resolution to capture some of the variability in the provenance of marine sediments derived from glaciated source areas.  The researchers will use the recovered core material to constrain the timing of deposition, sediment mixing rates, sediment fluxes, and sediment sources, to infer glacial dynamics, and to characterize basic visual and physical properties.   In collaboration with Oregon State University colleagues, they will obtain additional information about paleotemperature, salinity, and oxygen conditions.  The researchers will also process the marine seismic data for use in sequence stratigraphic correlations and baseline characterization of the proposed IODP drill sites.<br/>"

Mystery aside, Old Whaling is very important in the development of Eskimo culture because its members are believed to have been the first people to hunt large baleen whales in the Bering Strait region. The existence of Old Whaling culture in Chukotka has been hypothesized, but until now has not been demonstrated. This project will investigate the Old Whaling culture in Chukotka by excavating a recently discovered archaeological site near the village of Nunligran. The project is will include archaeologists from the Institute of Heritage in Moscow (Sergey Gusev and Igor Makarov) and the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography - Kunstkamera in St. Petersburg (Dmitri Gerasimov) who will work in close collaboration with archaeologists (Daniel Odess and Caroline Funk, University of Alaska Fairbanks), a zooarchaeologist (Erica Hill, University of Alaska Southeast), and a graduate student (Sarah Meitl, University of Alaska Fairbanks). The project will also include a Yup'ik high school student who has been working with the PI in the field and the laboratory for three years, as well as students and other community members from Nunligran. Together the research team will excavate the site with the goal of answering the following questions: What is the nature of the Old Whaling occupation at Nunligran, and how is it related to the Old Whaling occupation at Cape Krusenstern? What evidence is there for cultural ties across Bering Strait around 3000 years ago? How did people at the site make a living, and did the people who lived there hunt whales? How is the shift to whaling, as a subsistence activity, reflected more broadly in social and community organization and changes in land use? The project is intended to foster international collaboration and community involvement in research important to people on both sides of Bering Strait.<br/><br/>"

UAM is home to one of the largest research collections of frozen animal and plant tissues in the world.  In addition to its global scope, it features unparalleled holdings of arctic and subarctic material from a region undergoing profound environmental change and rapidly increasing human encroachment.  Notable holdings include the largest and fastest-growing collection of marine mammal tissues in the world; samples from migratory birds that come from six continents to breed in Alaska each year; and permafrost-preserved tissues from extinct Pleistocene organisms.  The conversion to a liquid nitrogen system will secure an incalculably valuable scientific resource for ongoing and future research and education efforts.  Nearly all frozen tissues are associated with voucher specimens, adding to their information content and allowing for research on countless aspects of organismal biology beyond genetics and genomics.  For example, samples from the UAM-GR are routinely used by scientists globally to investigate questions in evolution, ecology, toxicology, biomedicine, and numerous other fields.  The project will also train students in modern cryopreservation technology and collection management and outlines plans to leverage ongoing outreach of the UAM to highlight the research, education and wider societal benefits of the collection.<br/><br/>This project is funded to facilitate the purchase and installation of four Liquid Nitrogen cryovats and associated racks to replace failing mechanical freezers.  Additionally, a liquid nitrogen plant of sufficient production capacity to maintain eight cryovats will be maintained. The resulting configuration represents a 68% increase in space efficiency and will accommodate all samples currently housed in failing mechanical freezers as well as an anticipated 20 years of continued growth.  The transition to a cryopreservation system entirely based on liquid nitrogen will enhance specimen security and significantly reduce energy consumption.  This project will train graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge cryopreservation methods and collections-based research in the biological sciences.

The two weeks will be spent in a series of lectures, field trips, and experiments, at the space physics research facilities located around interior Alaska. The school has started out each year with a week in the Fairbanks area with lectures at the Geophysical Institute, and tours of the Geophysical Institute, the Poker Flat Research Range, and a nearby ionospheric heating facility. Student experiments scheduled for the facilities in the Fairbanks area have been carried out during the first week of the school. For the second week of the school, the group has relocated to the High-Frequency Active Auroral Radar Project (HAARP)  Ionospheric Observatory at Gakona, Alaska, for additional tours and experiments.  The motivation for this summer school is to provide an opportunity for students to study the upper atmosphere and ionosphere at polar latitudes with practical experience built into the learning process. There is a need for more trained scientists and engineers with knowledge of the special effects that occur in the ionosphere at high latitudes. The summer school is provided to attract students with exceptional talent to become more familiar with this exciting area of study."

One of the most urgent challenges facing humanity is to understand how coupled human and natural systems interact to enhance or erode the resilience of regional and global ecosystems, economies, and cultures. The goals of this project are to merge social and natural science knowledge to foster a better understanding of patterns of human activity and environmental change, to address key environmental problems and opportunities unique to high latitudes, and to develop new methods for framing and analyzing them. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>This undergraduate pilot program, Sustainability and Stewardship in Alaska (SSA), is organized along lines parallel to NSF's Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program but focused on undergraduate education and research. SSA builds upon the concepts and much of the operational structure of the University of Alaska's IGERT program, Regional Resilience and Adaptation (RR&A). The project focus is on investigations of environmental, social and cultural impacts of global change in Alaska within the broader context of sustainability and stewardship in the circumpolar North. To leverage the strengths of the IGERT program's institutional foundation at UAF, SSA maintains close connections and interactions with the RR&A program structure and personnel. SSA includes a set of three advanced undergraduate courses, two summers of field research, and UAF-funded research internships. SSA students join IGERT graduate students for a program of seminars, workshops, and mentoring. SSA students also mentor students in related precollege education summer programs at UAF. The program represents an exploratory version of an undergraduate program that, if fully embodied, would be a new degree program. The requirements and feasibility of SSA's full embodiment is a key subject of investigation during the two-year grant period.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The retention of Alaska Native students in the University of Alaska at Fairbanks (UAF) science departments is not exemplary. However, UAF's Department of Alaska Native and Rural Development (DANRD) has the best record of retention of Alaska Native students on campus. SSA works in close association with DANRD. In addition, the PI and coordinator of the NSF-funded Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program (ANSEP), as well as the local chapter of American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) collaborates to involve Alaska Native students in the project. The latter programs provide tutors, social gatherings, and peer mentoring to a cohort of Alaska Native students majoring in science in the University of Alaska system. SSA has established partnerships with Alaska's Globe program schools, Schoolyard LTER (Long-Term Ecological Research) project, and the Global Change Education Using Western Science and Native Observations program.  The education and outreach PI of these K-12 programs, a UAF faculty member, is working with SSA to the mutual advantage of the undergraduate and precollege students in these programs. The partnership reinforces and enriches these programs with the participation of undergraduates who are actively involved in interdisciplinary research - research that is directly related to what the school children are doing in their excellent, science education standards-based programs."

Understanding how these exchanges are regulated and how they change is a key goal of the US Study of Environmental Arctic Change and the NSF Arctic Observatory Network.  The first goal of this work is year round monitoring of carbon, water, and energy balance at two arctic sites, Imnavait Creek in Alaska and Cherskii in Siberia.  The work will be a collaboration among researchers from the Marine Biological Laboratory, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Northeast Science Station, Russia, and the University of Michigan.  The second goal is the development of these two sites as  ?Flagship? observatories for research on arctic lands and freshwaters.  The main task here is to integrate the new carbon, water, and energy balance data with the already large, diverse, and growing data bases from other research done at these sites.  A third aim is to promote PanArctic comparisons and development of PanArctic data bases.<br/>  <br/> Broader impacts include contributions to education, including underrepresented groups, through participation in the Logan Science Journalism program, the Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research Schoolyard program, and outreach to Native Alaskan communities.  Research and education infrastructure will be enhanced by making the data bases available online.  Benefits to society include improved understanding of the impacts of climate change, especially in Alaska where the local residents are closely tied to the land through traditional, subsistence lifestyles."

The next frontier for AON is facilitation of approaches that better quantify landscape and regional ecohydrological process by employing new analytical technologies (laser spectroscopy based water isotope analyzers) and integration of platforms, such as aircraft and satellites. This transformation of AON will initiate studies that quantify and integrate the heterogeneous landscapes of the Arctic tundra, while developing parallel capabilities to the NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network) program, thereby extending the relevance of AON to the continental-scale.

This is a high-risk approach because it is a novel use of this particular instrument and it will change how Arctic ecohydrology is monitored and assessed. EAGER is the correct venue for our project because this novel application of water isotope spectroscopy in an aircraft is ?high risk, high reward? research and represents a radically different approach from laboratory-based studies that are the status quo. The intellectual merit of this project will be accomplished by addressing these primary questions: a) What are the spatial and temporal patterns in water vapor isotopes during the growing and shoulder seasons across the tundra ecosystems in the Arctic Foothills and Foothill-Coastal Plain boundary in Northern Alaska? To a more limited extent, we also ask: b) What is the ET isotope signature associated with different ecosystem types and disturbances (fire and thermokarst) relative to background moisture? c) What is the strength of the ecosystem ET signal in the overlying atmosphere (above the ecosystem boundary height)? The first question focuses on flight measurements, the second on ecosystem tower easurements, and the third on integrating the two measurement scales. The broader impacts and outreach of our project will be accomplished by initially sharing our findings with the scientific community at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union and with students as part of our teaching and seminars at the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA) and the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF).

Location is thus an asset and an obstacle to geologic education in both states.  Hawai'i provides spectacular examples of on-going basaltic volcanism, but a Hawaiian student rarely sees non-basaltic rocks or structurally and tectonically complex geology.  Volcanoes of the Aleutian Arc are inaccessible to most Alaskan students, while field trips to view metamorphosed, folded, and faulted rocks are hampered by severe weather during the academic year.  This Track 1 project is a joint Alaska-Hawai'i lecture and field course that builds on existing links between the scientific communities in Alaska and Hawai'i to address a mutual goal-to encourage Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian undergraduate students to enter the geosciences by exposing them to different geologic settings and processes.<br/><br/>The project consists of an 8 week, 3-credit sophomore-level lecture course on the geology of Alaska and Hawai'i, offered simultaneously at University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) and University of Hawai'i Manoa (UH) via videoconferencing. Immediately following the lecture portion of the class, all the students participate in a 7-day field trip to Hawaii hosted by UH faculty that focuses on active volcanic processes, volcano monitoring and analysis, and associated natural hazards.  The class then goes to Alaska for a 7 day, UAF-hosted field trip on the geology of Alaska, where the focus is on collisional tectonics and associated volcanism, faults, folds, metamorphism, and sedimentation.  Alaska Native, Hawaiian, and other minority undergraduate students are specifically recruited for the class, with enrollments kept low to encourage student interaction with both the faculty and other students.<br/><br/>This project builds on the framework developed by the Pacific Alliance (a NSF Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program).

The project broadens the participation of these minority groups in the geosciences by exposing them to different geologic disciplines, professionals, and career options.  The project builds on existing academic ties between UAF and UH and, in the process, provides Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and other minority students the opportunity to experience a different indigenous culture while exploring graduate study options at both schools.<br/>"

Cyberinfrastructure for Discovering Climate Change Impacts in Water Resources Across Alaska and the Hawaiian Islands<br/><br/><br/>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br/><br/>This project seeks to develop and demonstrate the capability of a Pacific Area Climate Monitoring and Analysis Network (PACMAN). PACMAN is expected to yield a more reliable understanding of the impacts of climate warming on fresh water resources and communities in Alaska and Hawaii. In addition, PACMAN will include modeling and planning activities that can advance the understanding of immediate and long-term precipitation patterns across the North Pacific. PACMAN?s capabilities will include: (1) real-time access to synoptic satellite data and in-situ sensor systems, deployed throughout Alaska and the Hawaiian Islands; (2) integration of these datasets with archival data from existing research databases and drawn from sophisticated web-harvesting capabilities; (3) redundant archival of all data and information products; (4) real-time distributed simulation from supercomputing centers in Alaska and Hawaii; (5) a collaborative framework for visualization and multi-dimensional mapping; (6) development of and reliance upon open-source web tools; (7) development of an agent-based framework for assessing societal impacts, and; (8) open distribution to researchers and policy makers in Alaska, Hawaii, and around the world through the Internet.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The core cyberinfrastructure to be developed will enable research focused on measuring and understanding the macro- and micro-scale processes that influence fresh water and its ties to the social, cultural, and environmental wellbeing of communities in Alaska and Hawaii. The researchers seek to understand the dynamics of the integrated climate-water-social system from the local to global scales, and use this understanding as a basis for evaluating the effects of climate change on water resources. The integration framework goes beyond discipline-based inquiry and will be fundamental to understanding the impacts of climate variability and change on ecosystems? functions and biodiversity. The project uses the state-of-the art environmental monitoring and information management system initiated in the prior Hawaii EPSCoR RII awards as the core platform. This management system platform will be further developed in the Track-2 project so that it can handle the complex data processing, simulation, sharing, and integration needs of diverse teams of researchers in various targeted thematic areas.<br/><br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The PACMAN consortium?s projects will enhance the abilities of Alaskan and Hawaiian communities to understand, plan for, and respond to changing climate conditions. It will inform effective policies that build resilience in fresh water resource management at multiple scales of control. The project will build upon the successes of previous Alaska and Hawaii EPSCoR RII educational and public outreach plans, as well as the Pacific and Alaska Regional Integrated Science and Assessment programs funded through National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.<br/><br/>PACMAN will incorporate capabilities that are relevant to addressing other ?real-world? issues that most directly affect the coupled human-environment systems of the North Pacific, and will provide data and information products that are appropriate for, and capable of advancing a broad suite of cultural, economic, educational, and environmental missions across Alaska and Hawaii. This will be accomplished in two ways: 1) through the development of a highly accessible agent-based model capable of assessing the consequences of different hydrological scenarios, and 2) through the reliance of an External Advisory Group consisting of members drawn from potential end-user groups such as land holders, native Alaskan and Hawaiian groups, NGOs, K-12 schools, and government agencies to ensure that the consortium effectively engages Native Alaskans and Native Hawaiians in the project.  <br/>"

The University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF) proposal is in response to the National Science Foundation Program Solicitation NSF 07-515 for the management, acquisition and operation of an Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV). The construction of an ARRV was given the highest priority in the report ?National Academic Research Fleet ? a Long Range Plan for Renewal?.   The proposed design was developed with input from the oceanographic science community and the academic fleet operators.  The design was completed in December 2004 and is well suited for oceanographic and fisheries research in the harsh, ice-infested Alaska seas during all seasons.  <br/><br/>UAF proposes to assemble a management team for the acquisition of the ship that draws on extensive experience for public agency ship procurements.  They propose to use experienced personnel and vessel acquisition procedures that have proven successful in Alaska Marine Highways (AMS) recent vessel acquisitions.   UAF will be using the Earned Value Management (EVM) and Project Execution Plan (PEP) systems used by AMS during these acquisitions.  The University is contracting with two experience marine science technical engineers to insure the ship science capabilities are not compromised. <br/><br/>In any large shipyard project there are several areas of risk; delays in delivery of critical materials and equipment, such as steel plate or the propulsion system; lack of change order control; untimely or delays in regulatory inspections; lack of fiscal responsibility and/or lack of a realistic contingency or de-scouping plan.  To aid in controlling these risks NSF has developed a tight cooperative agreement with stringent reporting requirements.  In addition, NSF required an oversight committee be established composed of an outside naval architect, two Marine Superintendents with shipyard construction experience, two marine technical engineers (not part of the UAF project team), three oceanographic scientist with experience in the Arctic and sub-Arctic, one fisheries oceanographer and one Alaskan Native.  Monthly meetings with the oversight committee will be required.<br/><br/>The proposal was reviewed by 10 mail reviewers and 10 panelists.  A major recommendation from the panel was a phased acquisition strategy to mitigate risk.   A four phase approach is proposed with given milestones to be completed prior to funding of the next phase.  The CA provides for the Phased approach and outlines milestones for each Phase.  Phase I includes the completion of the PEP, design refresh and cost update, project execution plan, development of an oversight committee, draft shipyard contract and completing the formation of the project management team.  Phase II milestones include completion of shipyard RFP and Technical specifications, Proposal evaluation, contract award and Baseline Review.  Phase III is the construction of the vessel including regulatory and Classification certificates.  Phase IV includes the science test cruises in open and ice-covered waters and the warranty period.  The proposed in-service science date is 2011.       <br/>"

The fate of this carbon, however, is uncertain because of the widespread degradation of permafrost, which plays a key role in sequestering soil carbon. If the climate warms another 5 to 8 C in Alaska, as predicted by the IPCC (2001), nearly all of the permafrost could be eliminated from this biome, causing dramatic changes in the water and carbon balance of boreal ecosystems.<br/><br/>The effects of permafrost degradation (thermokarst) on surface water and carbon is highly uncertain because of the spatial variability in terrain, topography, vegetation, fire regime, and permafrost characteristics. While field studies have begun to recognize the importance of thermokarst in carbon accumulation and subsequent methane emissions, current modeling approaches still assume a fairly homogenous soil landscape where thawing uniformly lowers the permafrost table and dries the soils. This assumption probably holds up well for permafrost-affected upland areas (23% of boreal landscape in Alaska), but is not valid for lowlands areas (41% of landscape), where thermokarst impounds water. Furthermore, the degradation of permafrost affects the export of carbon very differently in upland and lowland landscapes. In upland landscapes the loss of permafrost increases drainage, which eliminates or alters the seasonality of surface runoff. In contrast, thermokarst in lowland landscapes impounds water into isolated wetlands, thereby disrupting drainage and increasing storage capacity that in turn reduces runoff and increases the residence time of dissolve organic carbon in isolated wetlands. Thus, current modeling approaches neglect the varying ways in which permafrost affects water and carbon on the landscape.<br/> <br/>To address these issues, this project will generate a new approach to modeling boreal forest systems by using research tasks designed to (1) assess interactive effects of climate change and fire on permafrost stability; (2) quantify how the varying modes of permafrost degradation initiate various thaw regimes on the landscape by affecting the microtopography, drainage, and soil thermal regimes of boreal systems; (3) determine how various thaw regimes such as drained or ponded systems affect carbon loss or accumulation in biomass and soils, and (4) characterize the export of dissolved organic carbon from watersheds in an effort to fingerprint the various thaw regimes induced by permafrost degradation. Using a replicated design, we will study age sequences of thaw history to capture changes in carbon and water over time since thaw. We will characterize temperature, moisture, water table of each thaw regime to parameterize the physical conditions of each thaw regime and will test model results based on the chemical finger print of thaw-water and on trace gas flux in one unique set of sites.<br/> <br/>Broader Impacts: Realistic spatial biogeochemistry models must quantify the redistribution of water and carbon across the landscape that results from permafrost degradation. Process-based biogeochemistry and spatially-explicit permafrost models developed in this project will address interactions among climate, fire, permafrost, carbon and water for the boreal region. This proposal will unite modelers with field scientists. The project will be used to train a new generation of scientists in ecosystem sciences through graduate education at Purdue University and University of Alaska at Fairbanks. Public outreach will be achieved by participating in policy meetings and workshops. Project results will be communicated through scientific meetings and publications and will be distributed through Newsletters and Annual Reports of the Purdue Climate Change Research Center. In addition to the contributions to the global change research community, the knowledge of impact of permafrost degradation on ecosystem carbon and water cycling is critical to the management of fires and habitats on federal lands."

Research and training productivity of the facility is solid, with the SMC serving as the home base for both students and faculty, and as a staging base for visiting scientists. The SMC also provides a unique outreach to native populations, despite being in a small and remote area. It has done an excellent job in fostering the NOSB competition by involving several high schools, and by hosting the national competition in 2008. It has met the challenge of its remote location (it is 500 miles from the main campus at Fairbanks) through the use of video conferencing classes.

Sustainability science is an emerging field that addresses the challenges of meeting human needs without harm to the environment, and without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their needs. A strong scientific workforce requires individuals educated and trained in interdisciplinary research and thinking, especially in the area of sustainability science. With the SEES Fellowship support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish herself in an independent research career related to sustainability. This project focuses on the sustainability of shelfish harvesting in Alaska.<br/><br/>In Alaska, paralytic shellfish poisoning caused by the marine alga Alexandrium is a severe and persistent problem that significantly impacts human health and the availability of shellfish resources. This project aims to enhance sustainability of commercial, recreational and subsistence shellfish harvest in Southeast Alaska by addressing the ecology of Alexandrium harmful algal blooms and their sociocultural impacts. <br/><br/>Despite the recognized impacts of paralytic shellfish poisoning, little research has been done on the causative organism, Alexandrium, and the sociocultural impacts of toxic Alexandrium blooms in the Southeast Alaska region.  This study is a three-pronged effort.  First, the project bolsters understanding of the ecological mechanisms that promote Alexandrium blooms by mapping cyst seedbeds (i.e., bloom initiation sites), monitoring cyst emergence, and identifying environmental conditions under which blooms form. This information adds to the body of scientific knowledge about Alexandrium bloom dynamics in coastal, fjord systems, provide early-warning information about toxic bloom development and help focus future paralytic shellfish poisoning testing and harmful algal bloom monitoring efforts in Southeast Alaska.  Second, the application of novel in situ sensors will overcome previous benthic emergence monitoring challenges and has the potential to improve harmful algal bloom forecasting capabilities. Third, human dimensions research will generate critical information about how social systems can reduce vulnerability to harmful algal blooms and how local/traditional knowledge can support scientific efforts by establishing strong community partnerships.

The collaborative effort, which will take place in Alaska, will make co-located absolute gravity observations (performed by scientists at the University of California, San Diego) and GPS observations (undertaken by scientists at the University of Alaska).  Different models of postseismic viscoelastic relaxation predict observable gravity changes over 1000 km length scales, with a complex spatial pattern. To date, the viscosity profile is best determined by postglacial rebound studies. Gravity and GPS measurements offer the opportunity to obtain viscosity profile estimates for the Alaskan plate boundary. The area is especially interesting, as the viscosity of subduction zone materials may be very different from that beneath the centers of continental and oceanic plates.  Aseismic creep is predicted to produce deformation of a more limited and markedly different spatial character than that of viscoelastic relaxation.  Determining the contribution of aseismic creep in postseismic deformation is important in estimating recurrence intervals for great earthquakes.  <br/>This project will recover and re-measure previously established absolute gravity stations in Fairbanks and Palmer, Alaska.  The two stations are near the minimum and maximum predicted gravity change in the far-field for proposed viscosity models.  The measurements are also co-located with existing continuous GPS stations. Comparisons with prior data will be used to test the method, and to provide the basis for model testing. <br/><br/><br/>"

EAGER is the correct venue for our project because this novel application of water isotope spectroscopy in an aircraft is ?high risk, high reward? research and represents a radically different approach from laboratory-based studies that are the status quo. The intellectual merit of this project will be accomplished by addressing these primary questions: a) What are the spatial and temporal patterns in water vapor isotopes during the growing and shoulder seasons across the tundra ecosystems in the Arctic Foothills and Foothill-Coastal Plain boundary in Northern Alaska? To a more limited extent, we also ask: b) What is the ET isotope signature associated with different ecosystem types and disturbances (fire and thermokarst) relative to background moisture? c) What is the strength of the ecosystem ET signal in the overlying atmosphere (above the ecosystem boundary height)? The first question focuses on flight measurements, the second on ecosystem tower easurements, and the third on integrating the two measurement scales.

The researcher proposes to develop indices that measure the long-term viability of rural fishing communities in Alaska by investigating how fisheries create and maintain culture and community.  To understand long-term viability of rural fishing communities this project will focus on socio-cultural factors such as culture change, kinship based social networks, and local-level politics that shape contemporary commercial and subsistence fisheries in Alaska.  It will also take into account the local mixed economy that enables families to ensure adequate food security.  In the North fisheries have become a reified symbol of the reliance on subsistence for many rural communities in sub-Arctic Alaska situated along river and coastal marine environments. This project will also identify whether a robust subsistence economy, particularly one focused on fisheries, is an indicator of cultural success in these communities.  Finally this project will identify whether a project such as this could create indices to measure the long-term viability of rural fishing communities in Alaska.  The project uses three communities as test cases; Kokhanok located in the Bristol Bay watershed, Chenega Bay located in Prince William Sound, and Tyonek located in Cook Inlet.  This project could be a model for other projects to investigate long-term viability of fishing communities in Alaska, or potentially across the North.  Understanding the viability of fishing communities in the United States is a critical component in sustaining community participation in fisheries and maintaining the uniqueness of fishing communities."

A major effort will be devoted to metadata for the Atlas using national metadata standards and peer-reviewed publications. Links will provide access to key supporting publications, photo glossaries, and other information relevant to the maps. We will develop the research tools, applications, and analyses needed by researchers, land managers, educators, and the public to access and use the data.<br/><br/>"

This occupational history makes it easier to understand how past residents used the site and how those uses changed through time. The first excavation of Walakpa took place in 1968-69, but much of the site remained unexplored. A few years ago, Walakpa began eroding into the sea due to rapid Arctic change, and urgent work to save the data began, resulting in data from two different excavations that need to be reconciled. This project identifies artifacts and samples from recent excavations for radiocarbon dating and chronological modeling to understand the dates of these archaeological layers with better accuracy and precision, allowing archaeologists to link archaeological layers identified in 1968-69 with the more recent rescue excavations, allowing for a more complete picture of the archaeology of Walakpa. <br/><br/>New radiocarbon samples will be taken from well-provenienced samples from known Birnirk (AD 500-1000) cultural levels and will be submitted for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating and isotopic analysis. Bayesian chronological modeling of the Walakpa site radiocarbon data will be applied to produce realistic estimates for the dates of the site's Birnirk presence. This work will help establish a better regional chronology for Birnirk and the transition to the subsequent Thule (AD 1000-1750) period on the North Slope of Alaska. The project will also ensure the proper packaging, shipment, and curation of materials at the Museum of the North at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, ensuring the samples are available for future generations of archaeologists. The results will allow researchers to study the artifacts from both excavations together and guide future archaeological research on the North Slope. Information and examples of change documented through this project, from a site that was occupied for such a long time through many changes, when combined with information from other similar sites, will provide a more robust picture of ancient settlement on the North Slope.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the combined effects of climate change and ocean acidification, which is caused by the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide, are altering the habitat of commercially important species. Climate induced enhancement of glacial melting may accelerate the progression of ocean acidification in the Gulf of Alaska even further. Due to a limited number of measurements in the Gulf of Alaska, little is known about the current state and rate of change of the chemical habitat of key species. Researchers from the University of Alaska Fairbanks propose to develop models of the ocean circulation, chemistry and biology for this region that will enable better understanding of environmental controls on ocean acidification in the Gulf of Alaska. In addition to communicating the science through a collaboration with the Alaska Ocean Observing System, the project will support a field course called ""Girls in Icy Fjords"", which is designed to inspire young women who have had limited opportunities due to life circumstances to pursue college educations and, possibly, careers in science.<br/> <br/>This project will identify the dominant controls and patterns of high carbon dioxide environments in the northern Gulf of Alaska. The few available observations document a seasonal manifestation of aragonite undersaturation in subsurface waters on this continental shelf. Particularly if it expands in time and space, such undersaturation could engender detrimental consequences for carbon dioxide sensitive organisms and potentially lead to altered food web structures, ultimately imparting large ecosystem and socio-economic consequences. However, the currently limited spatial and temporal data coverage precludes a detailed conceptual understanding of the physical and biological mechanisms controlling the local carbon dynamics and thus impedes our ability to anticipate and mitigate future changes. In this study, researchers will conduct high-resolution physical-biogeochemical hindcast model integrations and use neural networks, dye tracers and Lagrangian floats to detangle the complex interplay of mechanisms that drive aragonite undersaturation in the study region. The proposed physical-biogeochemical model configuration, which uses carbon and nitrate as model currencies, has been extensively evaluated for the greater North Pacific region at moderate (10 km) resolution. This model will be tailored to the Gulf of Alaska with a high (1.5 km) horizontal resolution, explicit forcing of coastal freshwater discharges, and modeled iron limitation. Such improvements will make this setup an attractive choice as a foundation for many other high-latitude biogeochemical modeling applications. The proposed experiments and analytical methods will take advantage of the three-dimensional model output and will provide insights into seasonal and interannual variability of enhancing and inhibiting controls of ocean acidification."

Wide-scale observations of freshwater ice and how its presence has changed over time will meet a fundamental need for a broad range of stakeholders, from rural communities that depend on ice for transportation and subsistence harvest, to industries that rely on winter water for ice road construction, to scientists studying climate change and ecosystem services. The Fresh Eyes on Ice observation network addresses this need by collecting data across a wide area of interior, western, and northern Alaska using satellite observations, monitoring stations on lakes and rivers, and field campaigns by snowmachine--all integrated with a partnership of community-based local scientists, teachers, and school children. The design for this observation network builds on the Alaska Lake Ice and Snow Observatory Network (ALISON), a project hosted by University of Alaska Fairbanks from 1999 to 2011 that used this basic premise for hands-on data collection by K-12 students and teachers in communities across Alaska. Teachers still informally use the ALISON program; by reviving this approach through the Fresh Eyes on Ice observation network, using modernized techniques, this project will foster new appreciation for environmental change in the Arctic and inspire new scientists, in addition to providing valuable information in a time of rapid change.<br/><br/>Winter is the most rapidly changing season in the Arctic, causing widespread responses in freshwater ice and the ecosystems and communities that rely on frozen lakes and rivers.  Freshwater ice dynamics--the formation, growth, and melt of ice--not only integrate winter climate conditions, but also impact permafrost, hydrology, greenhouse gas emissions, and human travel and subsistence. Long-term observations document dramatic changes in ice thickness and breakup timing in lakes and rivers of northern latitudes. Such ice observations come from rigorous programs conducted by government and academic scientists using satellites, in situ sensors, and sophisticated field measurements, but also from lake- and river-side communities, school classrooms, and subsistence-users who watch these changes daily. Together these ice observations provide a valuable and integrated record of winter climate change relevant at local, regional, and global-scales. Navigating the new Arctic with Fresh Eyes on Ice, a new freshwater ice observation network, revitalizes existing datasets and expands observations in space and time using modern satellite, aerial, and in situ sensing techniques integrated with community-based monitoring teams. Extensive late winter field campaigns, dedicated social media and data sharing between widely spaced communities and interested scientists, and visualization systems will connect communities in boreal and arctic Alaska, making science education and outreach seamless components of this observing network.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Locations of earthquakes underneath Alaska indicate that the Pacific plate is sliding beneath Alaska in a process of subduction.  These earthquakes stop abruptly west of the Wrangell mountains, but somehow the plates continue to converge for several hundred kilometers eastward through the Wrangell region. Because of the close connections between subduction and mountain building, the south Alaska region provides an exceptional testing ground to test theories of how the mantle behaves when slabs end, and how convergence makes earthquakes in subduction zones. <br/><br/>The centerpiece of this study is a temporary network of 37 broadband seismic stations deployed across southern Alaska to complement the EarthScope Transportable Array network along critical transects. It is providing data to tell whether or not subduction occurs under the Wrangells, and how the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone ends.  The research is being performed by a team with a well-established collaborative track record in advancing our understanding of subduction zones by deploying seismic arrays and integrating their results with other observations and models. Ongoing collaborations with petrologists and geodynamicists are helping spread the results to a broader geoscience audience. The project supports the training and professional development of two graduate students and provides excellent field-based opportunities to engage undergraduates in research. Outreach programs at the University of Alaska Fairbanks provide structured links to schools and science education centers in the region, reaching native populations with cutting-edge research. It supports an interdisciplinary collaboration with ample opportunity for the continued cross-disciplinary education among researchers and students. The Wrangell Volcanic Field represents a significant contributor to the total eruptive record in North America, and this study will provide critical framework for understanding this hazard as well.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>The proposed research is aiding significantly in improving our understanding of the dynamics of subduction zones, the response of lithosphere to subduction of buoyant crust, mass conservation in slab contortions, and the drivers of arc volcanism. Results from the temporary deployment of 37 broadband seismic stations focus on determining slab surface and wedge geometry from receiver functions in addition to ambient noise tomography, velocity and attenuation imaging, tremor and seismicity studies, and measuring anisotropy from shear wave splitting. It addresses the following questions: 1) Where is the eastern end of the Alaska-Aleutian slab, and what is its configuration? Does it end as a tear, or is it continuously warped?   2) What is the relationship between Yakutat crust subduction, transtension, and volcanism in the Wrangell mountains? Does regular subduction drive Wrangell volcanism, or flow and high temperatures at a tear or edge? Does thick Yakutat terrane crust subduct continuously beneath the Wrangell mountains?  3) What is the flow around the end of the Aleutian slab and how much is it driven by subduction versus larger plate-scale flow? Results are being used to understand the fate of subducted material beneath Alaska and its role in driving volcanism&#8232; and tectonics."

This multipurpose research ship will dramatically improve access to Arctic waters and is specifically designed to operate in seasonal sea ice and open ocean waters near Alaska, including the Chukchi, Beaufort, and Bering Seas, the Gulf of Alaska and southeastern coastal waters. Understanding changes in Arctic sea ice is vitally important to developing a better understanding of global climate change. Satellite observations have shown that the perennial ice in the Arctic is thinning at a rate greater than current models predicted, and recent research suggests the thinning is beginning to have major regional and global consequences.  The ARRV will provide a much needed, technologically advanced, oceanographic platform to enable multidisciplinary teams to conduct field research at the ice edge and in seasonal ice in order to address a variety of critical regional and global ecosystem issues including climate change and ocean circulation. This will be the first NSF new-build toward renewal of the U.S. academic research vessel fleet since the 1980s.  <br/><br/>The original University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF) proposal was in response to the National Science Foundation Program Solicitation NSF 07-515 for the management, acquisition and operation of an Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV).  The original proposal was reviewed by 10 mail reviewers and 10 panelists.  A major recommendation from the panel was a phased acquisition and construction strategy to mitigate risk and provide oversight.  A four phase approach was implemented by NSF with given milestones to be completed prior to funding of the next phase.  The design was completed in December 2004 and was refreshed during Phase I of the project following award of the Phase I CSA (0723426).  A successful Final Design Review (FDR) was held in October 2008 which utilized an external panel of experts to verify the project baseline (cost, scope, and schedule) as well as UAF?s Project Execution Plan (PEP).  Following the National Science Board (NSB) approval to proceed in March 2009, UAF began the shipyard selection phase (Phase II).  All Phase II milestones were completed successfully and NSF consent to award the shipyard contract was granted in early December 2009.  The project baseline was also updated from FDR following receipt of bids and reviewed internally by NSF for accuracy and sufficiency as part of the consent to award process.  This revised project baseline is the basis for this award and does not significantly differ from FDR or what was approved by the NSB.  NSF remains confident that the project can be successfully completed with a total project cost of $199.5M.   <br/><br/>Oversight of the project is maintained through weekly teleconferences with UAF, planned quarterly site visits, and annual external reviews. An independent oversight committee (AOC) provides advice and recommendations to both UAF and NSF on the technical and scientific priorities for the vessel throughout the planning and commissioning period.  NSF has also retained a consult with experience managing the construction and design of a similar research vessel in the UK.<br/><br/>UAF then awarded the construction contract to Marinette Marine Corporation of Marinette, Wisconsin on December 18, 2009.  The shipyard project kick-off meeting will be held in January 2010 with the first quarterly project review meeting in March to monitor design verification and transfer.  The AOC will hold their first sea trials and science operations planning meeting in February 2010.  The next external panel review will be held in May at NSF headquarters where progress during the initial stages of Phase III will be assessed by a panel of experts similar to FDR.  Actual construction will begin in September 2010.  Ship delivery and sea trials are planned for January 2013 with science operations beginning in January 2014.<br/>"

Fairbanks <br/>A Social-Ecological System (SES) is broadly defined as a system with interacting and interdependent physical, biological and social components, with a special emphasis on human interactions with nature.  As the world?s climate changes, and these intensifying changes increasingly hold ramifications for human populations, the need for concerted analysis of social-ecological systems (SES) is intensified.  Such dynamics are especially pronounced in Alaska, but are also present throughout the United States as population shifts and climate changes combine to produce changes in the intricate web of relationships that link human and natural systems. <br/><br/>The increasing urgency of the situation calls for a sharper focus on the methods and means of integrating biological, physical, and social sciences into SES models.  The Alaska EPSCoR Social-Ecological Systems Workshop will provide an ideal platform from which to accomplish this.  The goals of the SES workshop, to be held in Anchorage in May, 2009, are to enable information-sharing across EPSCoR jurisdictions about SES issues, including both policy and research matters; to identify areas for cross-jurisdictional SES research projects, which will improve funding competitiveness; and to consider collaboration and outreach strategies among researchers, policy-makers, and managers.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: Workshop speakers will discourse on emerging scientific innovations in social-ecological systems, highlighting new research tools available in the field. As SES is still an emergent field, the workshop will potentially have a transformative effect on SES study.  The workshop is specifically designed to build collaborations among NSF EPSCoR researchers and jurisdictions, thereby strengthening the nation?s research capacity.<br/><br/>Broader impact: SES study is by its nature interdisciplinary, and the workshop will include researchers from across the scientific spectrum. It will also heavily involve the policy and management side of SES study, potentially impacting not just how SES researchers proceed but how their findings are utilized and implemented.  Speakers will highlight opportunities for STEM educational outreach and workforce development through community-based research. In its study of specific populations SES is inherently concerned with diversity issues, and the workshop will deal with diversity in this sense as well as by tackling the issue of increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in SES research. <br/>"

Although astronomy is a fundamental component of all Alaska Native cultures, there has so far been no systematic effort to document indigenous knowledge of the Alaskan sky. Rapid change in traditional land use has led to this astronomical knowledge being even more endangered than the indigenous languages themselves. In this pilot project we focus on Gwich?in, the most viable of Alaska?s Dene (Athabaskan) languages. Extrapolating on more than a year of archival research, the project will work with culture bearers in the Alaska Gwich?in region to document Gwich?in terminology for starts, constellations, and astronomical events. The project will coordinate closely with work in progress with Canadian Gwich?in being conducted under the auspices of the Gwich?in Social and Cultural Institute. Finally, the project will seek to corroborate the existence of several major cosmological themes, which permeate Northern Dene languages. The primary project deliverable will be a report describing Gwich?in knowledge of the sky, along with star charts localized to the Gwich?in region. These materials will be made available through the Alaska Native Language Archive to be used by both scholars and educators.

The new instrument replaces an aging instrument and will allow continued teaching and research in several core fields of Alaskan and global importance.  Worldwide demand for precious and industrial metals is accelerating, but fundamental processes that lead to ore concentrations are poorly understood. Furthermore, Alaska's basic geology is still being worked out. UAF research in collaboration with the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys is continually refining the understanding of Alaska's geology and mineral resources. The new instrument will enhance cutting-edge research in how metals, such as gold in arsenopyrite, are concentrated in Earth's rocks. This type of research leads to more efficient precious-metal beneficiation. On a more fundamental level, analyses that determine the pressures and temperatures at which rocks form and deform are helping to create models that explain how magma moves in time and space, and how deeply exhumed rocks flow in fault zones. One of the most societally important roles of the UAF microprobe is through its link with the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO). Understanding active volcanism in Alaska is of international importance because of ground, airborne, and climatic effects from Alaska's 52 active volcanoes. The existing microprobe has played a crucial role in providing the AVO with rapid analyses of new volcanic materials during eruption crises. UAF's research on active magmatic systems requires high-quality elemental analyses of volcanic rocks on a microscopic scale, which will be possible with the new instrument. Studies of eruptive products will elucidate past eruptions and help predict the nature of potential future eruptions. Biologists will use the new instrument to reconstruct life histories of fish - many species of which are important in commercial, sport, or subsistence fisheries - through analysis of otolith growth rings. The new instrument, the only facility of its kind in the state of Alaska, will be broadly available to researchers and students and will enhance UAF's research enterprise through novel applications and by fostering national and international collaborations."

The Yup'ik Math Tool Kit takes advantage of Yup'ik conceptions of numeration, nonstandard measures, and patterns.  This tool kit will be refined and will form an integral part of this inquiry-based approach to teaching mathematics.  The team plans to develop computer software that children can use to copy, identify, analyze, and create Yup'ik patterns.    This four-year project is designed to serve a historically underrepresented group, indigenous Alaskan students, by linking mathematics with their culture.  This project will also provide these contextually rich mathematics problems to an audience well beyond the state of Alaska, with the intent of being national in its appeal.  To accomplish this, the project team will pilot and field test the modules in Alaska among school districts with an almost 100% indigenous population and outside of Alaska.  Lastly, the curriculum development team will form a partnership with the Alaska Rural Systemic Initiative in developing this curriculum and in providing teacher enhancement."

In this project on the Nenana River in central Alaska, teachers and students will record freeze-up and break-up, and thus duration of the ice cover. These ground-based observations will be supplemented by satellite remote sensing imagery using AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer), MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and ALOS (Advance Land Observing System) data. Between freeze-up and break-up, students will measure ice thickness, and the depth, density and water equivalence of snow on the ice. Throughout the year, water samples will be obtained for simple geochemical analysis of a river that originates at a glacier in the Alaska Range. Teachers will participate in classes and workshops that will provide content knowledge as a background to making river ice, snow and water observations and measurements in a changing climate; prepare them for spring break student workshops; and address classroom transfer and alignment of observations and measurements with educational standards. Formative and summative evaluation will document the impact of using the focal point of networked observations of a river system as a geoscience education strategy in a highly distributed, rural community.  The partnership of K-12 teachers, students and professional scientists is expected to yield valuable new information about freeze-up, break-up and ice duration, ice thickness, and the depth, density and water equivalence of the snow on the ice along the Nenana River.

Recent attention to indigenous place names in Alaska has profound implications for our understanding of the relationships between humans and their environment. Just as the Athabaskan place name Denali reflects an Alaska Native perspective on the land, the thousands of Iliamna Yup'ik place names provide insight into land use, migration, and conservation in a critical geographic area. The Iliamna region lies at a crossroads between the core Yup'ik speaking area in the Kuskokwim River drainage and the more peripheral Bristol Bay and Alaska Peninsula regions. It is here that Yup'ik speakers are in contact with speakers of the very different Dena'ina Athabaskan language. The Iliamna region is also rich in natural resources, including fisheries and minerals. Documentation of traditional knowledge of the environment will thus not only help to understand the history of Yup'ik peoples in this region, it will also inform future resource policy in Alaska.   <br/><br/>This project is extremely urgent, as the Iliamna dialect of Yup'ik is critically endangered. The oral narratives and place name maps recorded by this project will serve as an enduring record for future generations of local residents of the Iliamna Lake area and other scholars. The co-PI has a well-developed working relationship with the Iliamna Lake communities, and the collaborative approach ensures the success of the planned research. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to explore Yup'ik peoples' ways of using landscape and interactions with the land by analyzing Iliamna Yup'ik place names within oral narratives as they relate to sense of place. Place names reflect human interaction with the landscape, both mythically through creation stories and prosaically through individual and collective experiences of and observations on the land. People share place names and useful information about the environment with others when traveling, harvesting resources, and trading goods with neighboring groups. <br/><br/>Using a community-based participatory research method, this project will develop a typology categorizing Yup'ik place names and oral narratives in cultural and physical meanings. Methodology will include participant observation, key respondent interviews, and mapping exercises in the Iliamna communities Newhalen, Iliamna, Kokhanok, and Igiugig. Fieldwork will be conducted during all seasons in order to better capture the seasonal nature of Yup'ik land use. During the fieldwork local Tribal/Village Council members and Yup'ik speaking Elders will participate in the research and formulate additional research questions from a local perspective. The results of the research will serve as the basis for the co-PI's University of Alaska Fairbanks Ph.D. dissertation. More broadly, this project will serve as a model both for documentation of Iliamna Yup'ik place names and oral narratives, and documentation of Iliamna Yup'ik geographic knowledge and environmental changes. The documentation of local geographic knowledge will be useful to linguists, anthropologists, Yup'ik educators, geographers, other scholars in a variety of disciplines and state and federal land use managers."

On average 2 volcanoes are in a state of eruption every year. Volcanoes in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska Peninsula, and Cook Inlet are capable of sudden, explosive, ash-cloud forming eruptions, which are potentially hazardous to passenger and freight aircraft along this heavily travelled air corridor. Many of Alaska?s volcanoes are in remote locations with harsh environments. Monitoring these volcanoes represents a formidable challenge and many of the volcanoes are not instrumented. Infrasound (acoustic waves with frequencies below the 20 Hz hearing threshold of the human ear) is a rapidly developing technology to understand and monitor explosive volcanic eruptions. Modest-sized explosive eruptions produce powerful infrasound signals that propagate efficiently over thousands of kilometers in the atmosphere. However, to date, these signals have been recorded by sparse infrasound sensor networks, limiting our understanding of their source generation and propagation through the atmosphere. The EarthScope Transportable Array (TA) is currently being deployed in Alaska, bringing the densest ever combined seismic and infrasonic network to one of the world?s most active volcanic regions. Exploiting this novel dataset, this project will advance the capability of acoustic early warning systems of volcanic eruptions for aviation safety and will assess the potential contribution of large sensor networks such as the TA to volcano monitoring. At the end of the project, an operational volcano-acoustic monitoring system resulting from this work will be implemented at the Alaska Volcano Observatory.<br/><br/>This work will capitalize on the unprecedented seismo-acoustic dataset starting to become available as the TA records Alaska?s routine explosive volcanism with dense spatial wavefield sampling. Volcano seismo-acoustics is a rapidly advancing research field, where basic questions remain on the source mechanisms, source directionality, atmospheric propagation, and seismo-acoustic coupling from explosive volcanic eruptions. This project will focus on detection, discrimination, and location of the signals using novel methods; quantifying the seismo-acoustic wavefield; investigating the source mechanisms; quantifying seismo-acoustic wave coupling; and understanding infrasound propagation in the spatio-temporally varying atmosphere. Through a combination of data analysis and modeling, we will characterize and quantify diverse seismic and infrasonic signals recorded at a range of distances and directions from the explosive eruption source. We will address the following questions: (1) How do observed acoustic and seismic signals from explosive volcanic eruptions vary with distance and azimuth to the source? (2) How does acoustic propagation differ for various types of explosive eruptions? (3) What kind of volcanic source information can be determined from long-range seismo-acoustic data? (4) What are the wavefield sampling limitations in previous volcano infrasound studies? (5) What other infrasound sources are present in Alaska? Our team will work with the EarthScope National Office at the University of Alaska Fairbanks to help highlight this research and its impacts. Multi-media products illustrating seismo-acoustic wavefields from volcanic eruptions in Alaska will be distributed via the web for use in public information packets and education and outreach. Event catalogs and related data products will be publically available, with notable infrasound events uploaded to the IRIS TA Infrasound Reference Event Database (TAIRED).<br/>"

Participation of underrepresented people will be encouraged by recruiting women and members of minorities, especially Alaska Natives. Ecosystem-based management of living marine resources, as required under modern law and policy, has broad societal impacts. Alaska is an ideal setting for exploring these impacts and evaluating alternative management strategies because the waters off Alaska account for a majority of U.S. fish harvests and because stocks of fish and marine mammals off Alaska, while largely healthy, include stocks that are endangered. Utilization of these stocks dates back over 10,000 years and even now ranges from small-scale subsistence and artisanal harvests to technologically advanced industrial-scale fisheries. SELMR graduates will be well-prepared to devise ecosystem-based solutions to critical research and stewardship questions in the sustainable use of living marine resources, skills that are critically needed in today's society."

Furthermore, this research will attempt to establish the actual time of extinction of the Holocene mammoth population on St. Paul Island, Pribilof Islands, Alaska, and apply this information to test various proposed causal hypotheses for the extinction.<br/><br/>Cores from Cagaloq Lake, St. Paul, will be sampled for chironomids (aquatic invertebrates), pollen, coprophilous fungi spores, plant macrofossils, charcoal, ancient DNA and cryptotephras. Oxygen isotopes from the heads of chironomids will provide an independent climate record that can be supplemented by paleoecological analyses of the chironomid assemblages. Studies will also test chironomid species for isotope fractionation to disentangle climate signals from ground water effects. Terrestrial community changes will be reconstructed from pollen, spores and plant macrofossils; and charcoal frequency will be used to document fire events. Analysis of ancient DNA will provide data on cryptic plant and animal species that have not been detected by traditional methods of analysis, and can also be used to identify taxa to species.<br/><br/>Spores that grow on animal dung will be used as proxies for the mammoth population size and to document the time of mammoth extinction on the island.

Studies have established the limiting process on isolated vortex ring formation from a starting jet, and associated optimal ring formation with the limiting formation time. Inspired by animals such as squids and medusae, a novel propulsion technique has been developed utilizing consecutive vortex rings generated from a pulsed jet. The ring formation process of a pulsed jet is significantly different than that of a starting jet because when rings are generated in a repeated fashion, the interaction between rings alters the dynamics of jet shear layer and vortex formation. This is demonstrated in a recent study in which the limiting formation time is reduced significantly when a pulsed jet generates consecutive vortex rings in close proximity. The formation time alone is not sufficient to describe the ring formation process and the pulsing frequency also plays a significant role. To fully exploit the potential of pulsed-jet propulsion, it is imperative to investigate the influence of vortex interaction on ring formation and establish the limiting ring formation process and its optimization for a pulsed jet.  In this proposed project, experimental studies will be performed to investigate the formation process of consecutive vortex rings from a pulsed jet and to determine the effects of ring interaction on the shear layer dynamics and ring formation process. The research will emphasize vortex ring growth and its limit, as a dynamical systems analysis will be used to quantify entrainment and identify pinch-off. The dependency of the limiting formation time on the pulsing frequency will be established. Thrust generated from a pulsed jet will be quantified and correlated with ring formation dynamics. A theoretical model will then be developed to predict ring pinch-off and to explain the empirical results. A numerical framework will also be developed to optimize the kinematics of the pulsed jet for vortex ring formation and propulsion. Many features of biological systems that act as constraints in optimal ring formation will also be explored, including stopping vortices formed during recovery strokes, time-dependent jet velocity profile, periodic variation in propulsion velocity, etc.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed project will advance the understanding of vortex ring formation from a pulsed jet, and elucidate the effects of vortex interaction on jet shear layer dynamics and ring formation. It will establish the limiting ring growth process for a pulsed jet, as well as its optimization for propulsion. The knowledge obtained in the project will serve as the guideline for applications of pulsed-jet propulsion, a promising design for future aerial/underwater vehicles. In addition, the understanding on various constraints in optimal ring formation inherent in biological systems, as well as on their adaptations to these constraints, will not only contribute insights to the fields of biological locomotion and integrated biological systems but also complement existing design principles of engineering propulsion systems.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project will explore many fundamental fluid dynamics questions regarding vortex ring formation and interaction. It will have potentially wide applications in the emerging field of pulsed-jet propulsion and will further advance this novel propulsion technique. The proposed project will allow education and training for both undergraduate and graduate students. The PI will develop a new lab component (flow visualization and measurement) for the Fluid Mechanics Lab course at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The experimental equipment used in the project will be utilized for students practice in this course, and also as demonstration in another course, Propulsion. The proposed research will also be translated into new educational curricula that are accessible to future generations of engineers and biologists alike. The PI will develop a new multi-disciplinary course, Biomechanics and Bio-inspired Design, for the Mechanical Engineering and Biology curriculum at UAF.  Most Alaska students, especially Alaska Native students, love nature and this proposed course would appeal to many of them and generate interest in engineering disciplines. The project will also serve K-12 students from the State of Alaska through outreach programs such as Alaska Summer Research Academy and Alaska Native Science & Engineering Program. These opportunities for training and mentorship will be directed toward the underrepresented Alaska Native students."

This interdisciplinary graduate program will use case studies, courses, and seminars to teach the fundamental principles and analytical tools of fisheries science, oceanography, ecology, economics, management, marine policy, and anthropology. Students will collaborate on research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries; they will learn to address the unique challenges of ecosystem-based management and to understand its implications for society. The program will challenge students to develop innovative approaches to pressing real-world problems. Students will gain career-developing experience through research, teaching, and internships. MESAS will actively recruit women and minorities, especially Alaska Native students, and provide graduate students with opportunities to mentor Alaska Native and rural Alaskan undergraduates. Ecosystem-based public management of marine resources, now being required under law and regulation, will have broad societal effects nationwide. Alaska is an ideal setting for training the experts needed to implement ecosystem-based management successfully in the modern world. Alaska?s living marine resources, especially its fisheries, are largely healthy but also include examples of species that have dangerously diminished or have gone extinct within recent history. Alaska?s fishery harvests range from small-scale subsistence and traditional fisheries to the largest and most technologically advanced sustainable fisheries in the world. MESAS graduates will be well-prepared to develop ecosystem-based solutions to critical research and stewardship problems arising from the sustained use of living marine resources, skills that will be critically needed in the coming years.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries."

Located 700 km north of the Alaska-Aleutian trench, the Nenana basin is a 7 km deep, active sedimentary basin aligned with the 200 km long Minto Flats seismic zone. The seismic zone contains the highest concentration of deep (>15 km) crustal seismicity in central Alaska. Two deep events include a 2012 triggered earthquake with a 24 s nucleation phase, and also a 1995 Mw 6.0 earthquake that ruptured a small portion of the fault zone and strongly shook the region. The three-dimensional fault zone structure and the relationship between the active sedimentary basin and the sub-basin faulting are unknown, in part because no seismic station has ever been deployed in this remote region. The Tanana river provides access for a strategic 12-station deployment targeting the fault zone. Seismic waveforms from local earthquakes will be used to develop a catalog of accurate earthquake locations. A new moment tensor catalog for local events will characterize the style of faulting. Seismic wavefield simulations of earthquakes within the fault zone will be used to explore the influences of fault complexity, earthquake ruptures, and basin structure on the regional seismic wavefield. Modeling of the seismic data will help determine whether the anomalously deep crustal seismicity is related to overlying basin formation, to underlying slab-driven processes, or to laterally driven processes.<br/><br/>The seismic waveforms collected during this experiment will be the first ever recorded in this active tectonic region, and they will provide a valuable resource for future geophysical studies in central Alaska. Characterization of the Minto Flats fault zone will provide fundamental constraints on the competing tectonic models for basin formation and deformation within central Alaska. The project has a substantial education component that includes high school students from Nenana, as well as undergraduate and graduate students. Field-based teaching modules, classroom-based teaching modules, and annual field trips to science exhibits in Fairbanks will engage Nenana high school students in earthquake science and active tectonics of Alaska."

Populus also is the model organism for hardwood tree genomics and physiology. Population genetic tools are increasingly useful for identifying genes that underlie variation in ecologically and economically important traits, but are not presently available in Populus. This project will develop these tools for Populus balsamifera, use them to identify the genetic basis for phenotypic variation in bud set (an important determinant of cold adaptation and growth rate). This research also will test whether the same genes responsible for variation and adaptive evolution of bud set in North American P. balsamifera and European P. tremula. These objectives will be accomplished through collaboration with Canadian researchers who are establishing long-term common gardens of P. balsamifera. These common gardens will be maintained as a long term resource and are available to the wider scientific community; therefore, the data we generate will greatly facilitate future genotype-phenotype association analyses on additional economically and ecologically important traits (wood density, drought tolerance, etc.). The comparative population genomic analyses of adaptation to northern latitudes will be accomplished through collaboration with colleagues at the University of Umea, Sweden, who are conducting complementary research in European aspen (P. tremula).<br/><br/>Broader impacts and intellectual merit: This project will provide numerous training opportunities in plant genomics and bioinformatics for undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers. Training for undergraduate students will focus on developing and conducting scientific research and written and verbal communication of results. Research opportunities will be made available to Native Alaskan students through University of Alaska Fairbanks ANSEP Program. Graduate students and post-doctoral researchers will receive more in-depth training in scientific inquiry, communication of results, and mentoring. The research will form the basis for the development of laboratory exercises in DNA sequence analysis, population genomics, and association mapping for undergraduate courses.

In turn, these species depend on a short-lived spring algal bloom for growth and the accumulation of lipid stores in order to complete an annual life cycle that includes a period of dormancy. The intellectual thrust of this project measures how the timing and magnitude of algal blooms affect preparation for dormancy using a combination of field and experimental observations. The Northern Gulf of Alaska - with four calanid species that experience dormancy, steep environmental gradients, well-described phytoplankton bloom dynamics, and a concurrent NSF-LTER program - provides an unusual opportunity to identify the factors that affect dormancy preparation. Education and outreach plans are integrated with the research. Educational efforts focus on interdisciplinary opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral trainees. The project will generate content for existing graduate and undergraduate courses. U. of Alaska Fairbanks and U. Hawaii at Manoa are Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions, and students from these groups will be recruited to participate in the project.  Because fishing is a major industry in the Gulf of Alaska, outreach will communicate the role copepods play in marine ecosystems using the concept of a dynamic food web tied to production cycles.<br/><br/><br/>Diapause (dormancy) and the accompanying accumulation of lipids in copepods have been identified as key drivers in high latitude ecosystems that support economically important fisheries, including those of the Gulf of Alaska.  While the disappearance of lipid-rich copepods has been linked to severe declines in fish stocks, little is known about the environmental conditions that are required for the successful completion of the copepod's life cycle.  A physiological profiling approach that measures relative gene expression will be used to test two alternative hypotheses: the lipid accumulation window hypothesis, which holds that individuals enter diapause only after they have accumulated sufficient lipid stores, and the developmental program hypothesis, which holds that once the diapause program is activated, progression occurs independent of lipid accumulation.  The specific objectives are:  1) determine the effect of food levels during N. flemingeri copepodite stages on progression towards diapause using multiple physiological and developmental markers; 2) characterize the seasonal changes in the physiological profile of N. flemingeri across environmental gradients and across years; 3) compare physiological profiles across co-occurring calanid species (N. flemingeri, Neocalanus plumchrus, Neocalanus cristatus and Calanus marshallae); and 4) estimate the reproductive potential of the overwintering populations of N. flemingeri.  The broader scientific significance includes the acquisition of new genomic data and molecular resources that will be made publicly available through established data repositories, and the development of new tools for routinely obtaining physiological profiles of copepods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will help build the tribal capacity to monitor changes in local climate and permafrost by providing the Tribes the scientific knowledge and skills necessary to acquire, analyze, and interpret scientific data through training and education. The project will establish local climate and permafrost observation system and map land cover and permafrost in the Upper Kuskokwim region. It will also develop a geo-hazard map for the region to facilitate safe subsistence and recreational practices and land use.<br/>The specific objectives of this project are to 1) engage traditionally-underserved tribal communities of the Upper Kuskokwim region in permafrost and climate change research, 2) build community capacity to monitor changes in local climate and permafrost, 3) model the state and distribution of near-surface permafrost, and 4) develop a geo-hazard map. The high-resolution land cover, permafrost, and geo-hazard maps will serve the communities? need to identify sites experiencing rapid changes and could be hazardous. The land cover map will serve as a baseline map to detect future changes in land cover. The modeled permafrost maps of current and future decades will help identify sites where permafrost degradation will likely be severe if the climate continues to warm. <br/>The project will offer the traditionally-underserved tribal communities of the Upper Kuskokwim region and the Tribal Council an opportunity to engage in climate research. It will provide them the motivation, resources, climate science knowledge and skills to study the impact of climate change on their tribal way of life and environment. The data, knowledge, and skills gained through this project will benefit the tribal communities in adaptive management of subsistence resources, implementation of safe land use practices, and planning for the future. The scientific community will also benefit hugely by having an improved understanding of permafrost dynamics, access to field data and maps from this understudied remote part of Alaska. In addition, the project will provide outreach and workshops on climate change to the community members in Nikolai and to all students and teachers in Iditarod Areas School District through the Distance Learning Center facility in Fairbanks, Alaska."

It is driven by poorly understood processes occurring at the ice-ocean interface, such as subglacial discharge into the ocean, turbulent plume dynamics, submarine melting, and iceberg calving. These processes are (1) inherently interdisciplinary, requiring expertise in both glaciology and oceanography and (2) difficult to observe, requiring innovative field techniques and careful site selection. This project will address the relationship between subglacial discharge, turbulent plume dynamics, and submarine melting through a comprehensive field campaign at LeConte Glacier, Alaska, supplemented by a state-of-the-art modeling effort. The field site is ideal because it spans a wide range of forcings on daily to seasonal time scales and because the near-terminus fjord environment is accessible year round.  A successful project will provide a unique data set and improved models for projecting contributions to future sea level rise.<br/><br/>This interdisciplinary project, at the interface of the the fields of glaciology and oceanography, provides support for an early-career principal investigator (PI) (Amundson) from a predominantly undergraduate institution (University of Alaska Southeast) and an additional early career PI at University of Oregon.  More mature PIs at Oregon State University and University of Alaska Fairbanks Campus will mentor the younger team members, promoting workforce development.  Additional workforce development will be promoted through interaction with high school students and at the participating universities.  The team of PIs will entrain select students from a local Alaska high school to participate in aspects of the field work and engage with the school to integrate their observations into the curriculum.  The project will also provide support for the training two graduate students and a post-doctoral scholar.  The associated mentoring plan is very good.  Outreach to the general public will be enhanced by leveraging the PIs? home institutions? activities.  The PIs will continue established interactions with the National Park Service and the US Forest Service.  These include public lectures, as well as training for interpretive rangers who can reach a broad cross-cut of the public.  Finally, they will develop a brochure concerning their work to further enhance their public outreach.<br/><br/>This project will develop a parameterization of a plume, driven by subglacial discharge, as it interacts with the face of a marine-terminating glacier.  This is a goal that has been endorsed by the international community.  It will be accomplished by conducting three intensive field campaigns to<br/>i. sample the upwelling plume directly with manned and autonomous vessels,<br/>ii. measure the downstream impact of the plume on near-terminus fjord circulation,<br/>iii. determine subglacial discharge and submarine melt rates, and<br/>iv. survey associated changes in glacier terminus dynamics.<br/>Subglacial discharge and ambient water properties in the proglacial fjord will be monitored throughout the project in order to provide<br/>i. important context for the intensive field campaigns, and<br/>ii. a range of parameter space to be explored by a turbulence-resolving hydrodynamic plume model.<br/>Data from the intensive field campaigns will be used to validate the plume model, which will then be used to explore the wider range of parameter space that is provided by long-term measurements. The latter will allow investigation of the impact of submarine melting on glacier dynamics over seasonal timescales."

Over the past five years the University of Alaska Museum Bird Collection has grown by almost 11,000 specimens which probably places UAM among the top 10 institutions in North America in terms of bird collection growth.

Such increased understanding of global change requires GeoSTEM knowledge and broad participation, inclusive of minority populations. With the new Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), more rigorous geoscience curricula requirements are forthcoming and better qualified and more effective Earth Science teachers are needed. This is especially essential for rural Alaska, where unemployment is high and where indigenous student populations have traditionally been underserved.  <br/><br/>This three-year project implements mentored teaching experiences in remote rural villages to increase the number of Earth Science teachers in Alaska and targets the overall interest in geoscience careers of undergraduate and pre-college students (K-12). The project's interdisciplinary team from the University of Alaska School of Education (UAF-SOE), the UAF College of Natural Science & Mathematics (CNSM), the University of Alaska Museum of the North (UAM), and the International Arctic Research Center (IARC) in collaboration with Alaska's rural school districts will create and evaluate a multilayered recruitment and training program to increase the number of qualified and effective GeoSTEM teachers who understand and embrace the powerful local contexts of Alaska's Arctic Native villages. Participants will increase their understandings about: (a) the interdisciplinary nature of GeoSTEM contents; (b) place-relevant and hands on geoscience teaching practices; and (c) careers in geosciences and teaching. <br/>The project objectives are:<br/>(1) Development of a multilayered, sustainable recruitment program with focus on diversity participation in geosciences.<br/>(2) Development and implementation of a university-based, 3 credit GeoSTEM course that count towards both, UAF undergraduate geoscience and education degrees.<br/>(3) Implementation of mentored Earth/geoscience teaching experiences for GeoSTEM participants in indigenous rural schools that includes pre-college career education for geosciences. <br/>(4) Research and evaluation of the effectiveness of the (a) multilayered recruitment approach, (b) the university-based GeoSTEM course, and (c) the mentored geoscience field teaching experiences in indigenous and remote villages. <br/><br/>While the focus of this project is on increasing the number of Earth Science teachers, pre-college K-12 students will also benefit. During the geoscience-teaching experiences in indigenous and remote Alaska villages, participants will engage pre-college high school students in geoscience projects, hands on data collection and geoscience career education. This project serves initially 20 pre-service teachers and creates mentored field experiences in 10 schools serving 95% Native students and impacting immediately more than 400 indigenous students. This approach helps to create a pipeline into geoscience careers for indigenous students.  The proposed project supports Earth science teacher recruitment, effectiveness, retention, and equity in access to education for indigenous and rural students."

The curriculum and research of this IGERT prepares students in the theoretical and applied underpinnings of resilience theory, vulnerability analysis, and sustainability science. This renewal builds on the previous IGERT at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) by adding: (1) a focus on global-local linkages that shape sustainability at all scales, (2) a bridging program with UAF rural campuses makes this PhD program more accessible to Alaska Native students, and (3) opportunities for graduate students to participate in activities of the International Polar Year. <br/>This IGERT establishes new institutional partnerships and trains a new cadre of scholars who have the interdisciplinary skills to address the complex challenges of sustainability. These scholars will contribute to society through their skills in integrating knowledge and informing policy makers in mitigation and adaptation. This IGERT strongly supports the training of Alaska Native PhDs in this area who are needed to serve as university faculty, researchers, educators, and community leaders. This IGERT represents a US contribution to the International Polar Year through the establishment of a consortium of graduate programs with a focus on northern social-ecological resilience. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.<br/>"

It hosts diverse assemblages of New World and Old World birds and an endemic regional avifauna. The Bird Collection at the University of Alaska Museum (UAM) is one of growing national and international importance, representing many preparation types that enhance its utility. Additionally, UAM now houses the 8th-largest vouchered avian tissue collection in the world. This collection is rather heavily used, probably because it contains the best (and only modern) bird specimens from this vast region, and supports research in biodiversity, evolutionary history, management, and conservation. It is also used by artists, birdwatchers, social scientists, ecologists, ecosystem biologists, and toxicologists. Thus, the collection informs studies including assessments of contaminants and stable isotopes, climate change, human artifacts and art, and the historic diets of Alaska Natives. These collections contribute to our ability to address large-scale societal challenges such as health, food, and the environment. The collection's impact is exemplified by its citation in at least 115 publications and 28 student theses in recent years, and its Google Scholar profile (UAM Birds) further shows its high impact. The collection also serves as a focus for training and education at undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels, and as a showpiece for public engagement in science. However, the collection is severely overcrowded and is becoming inaccessible as portions are forced into unsorted and substandard housing. Skin, skeleton, and open-wing specimens are inadequately stored, inaccessible to users, and decisions about collection growth now focus on the size of the specimen being considered. These problems severely impact the use of this research resource by its diverse community of users. This project addresses these problems by installing new specimen cabinets on a compactor system and supporting student trainees to work closely with museum staff in rehousing the entire collection and in developing and implementing public outreach activities.<br/><br/>This project supports infrastructure that is critical to many types of studies requiring avian samples. It will enable the purchase and installation of 92 new specimen cabinets on a new mobile storage system, maximizing the use of space following the museum's expansion and renovation. This cabinet installation will adequately house and make accessible overcrowded specimens and provide room for growth for the next decade. Importantly, this project will train students in collections-based science, thus helping prepare the 21st century STEM workforce. It also engages the public locally and globally in the excitement of biological collections, fostering a better understanding of science and its role in serving society.

In the spring of 2012 the PI identified six umiak fragments from the Birnirk site (Barrow, Alaska) as fragments of a single boat assemblage. 19 additional boat fragments originating from the same and adjacent excavation units have a strong probability of belonging to the same boat and this project would test these fragments to determine whether they are from one or several structures. The significance of these findings is that skin boat frame assemblages are extremely rare in the circumpolar archaeological record; in situ fragments such as those described, in such quantity and from what appears to be fairly early origin, possibly as early as 1300AD, makes these fragments potentially the oldest known umiak frame assemblage in the Arctic. The project will  determine whether the fragments are from the same umiak and has the potential to place the structure within a larger chronological and cultural context and ultimately provide insight into early Arctic boat engineering and seafaring."

Understanding crystallization and differentiation in arc basaltic andesite magmas under changing C-O-H fluid compositions is key to understanding the magma storage systems of many arc volcanoes. Magmatic fluid contents play a fundamental role in their differentiation during storage, and whether they erupt explosively or effusively later on. To understand the latter, it is important to constrain the processes occurring in the storage region. Prior experimental studies provide important results on phase relations as a function of the mole fraction of H2O (XH2O) in the fluid phase, but relatively few studies exist that focus on H2O-undersaturated systems at crustal pressures (2 kbar). No prior experimental studies have compared crystallization during decompression of initially H2O-saturated vs. H2O-undersaturated melts, applicable to understanding microlite textures and crystallization processes during magma rise. The study will help fill the data gap through melting and reversal experiments on tholeiitic basaltic andesites from Westdahl and Okmok volcanoes. A novel aspect of this work will involve exploring how plagioclase crystallization kinetics may change during decompression of an initially H2O-undersaturated magma, as compared with one that was initially H2O-saturated. All phase compositions and textures will be measured using electron microprobe, back scattered electron images, and petrographic light microscope and image analyses. The high-pressure experiments will also be analyzed using reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy to confirm the fraction of H2O dissolved in the melt, compared with the XH2O calculated following previous experimental studies. The experiments will result in improved understanding of preeruptive magma storage and ascent prior to two recent eruptions in the Aleutians. They will also provide data that can be generally applied to understanding the effects of changing magmatic fluid compositions on crystallization processes during storage and ascent of arc basaltic andesite magmas.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts.  A subset of the experiments will be conducted by an undergraduate student and as part of an Advanced Petrology class, Spring 2007. The University of Alaska Fairbanks currently does not own a gas-mixing furnace; acquiring one will enhance the infrastructure in the Department of Geology and Geophysics. The results will provide a geodesy graduate student with petrology-based data for modeling inflation and deflation signals at Okmok volcano. The results will be disseminated through conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications, and through a newly developed web experimental petrology database, in conjunction with the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO). In collaboration with the AVO outreach coordinator, information about magma dynamics relevant to future eruptions at Okmok and Westdahl will be disseminated to interested people living near the volcanoes."

The bridge system consists of glass fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composite deck and precast/prestressed concrete I-girders. The primary  objectives are: (1) understanding the synergistic effects of low temperature and low-temperature thermal cycling combined with fatigue loading on the performance of FRP composite bridge decks in cold regions, and (2) quantifying the horizontal shear stiffness of typical deck-to-girder connection systems and developing the connection design criteria based on the shear stiffness rating of the connection.<br/><br/>One of the technical barrier to the use of composite materials in infrastructure applications is lack of data on environmental durability specific to typical infrastructure environments and for the types of composite materials that are likely to be deployed in the infrastructure. This project could potentially provide a basis for making long-term predictions about FRP composite material properties behavior under cold environmental conditions.<br/>The basic knowledge obtained is likely to be of long-lasting value. It can especially advance the knowledge base for application of structural materials, including effects derived from interaction with a natural environment. By using the appropriate materials and structural forms, the research will ultimately extend beyond Alaska and will benefit other regions.<br/>This project will enhance graduate student education through curriculum development and give undergraduate students an opportunity for research experience in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) by involving them in the research project. Another objective of the educational program is to involve K-12 students through UAF Alaska Summer Research Academy. These students will be exposed to structural engineering, and especially women and minority students in high schools will be mentored to encourage careers in structural engineering and to improve enrollment of traditionally underrepresented groups in engineering fields. With enrollments down and retirements up, what will our future engineering look like? A key part of the answer lies in the underrepresented majority, as pointed out in the recent ASEE 2003 Annual Conference & Exposition. This project also involves the development of a seminar series accessible through the World Wide Web (WWW) for remotely located professional engineers in the area of structural composite and precast concrete as alternative construction materials, which can extend the construction season in Alaska.<br/>This research will improve engineering research, education, and, ultimately, the engineer resource pool in cold regions. This project is congruent with the mission of UAF in that it will advance knowledge of natural and technological systems and include a northern perspective on research and education. The PI is a member of the engineering faculty at an EPSCoR institution, and this project will support the development of advanced material testing facilities at UAF, thus enhancing our infrastructure for future research and education goals.<br/><br/>"

It proposes to measure temperatures in a large number of globally distributed boreholes in order to provide a ""snapshot"" of permafrost temperatures in both time and space.  Education and training are stated goals of this project given there are fewer than ten government and academic researchers dealing with the acquisition and analysis of permafrost temperatures within the US.

They are also on the front lines of climate change, experiencing more rapidly changing conditions than plants elsewhere in the United States, resulting in rapid range shifts and local extinctions. The last comprehensive Flora of Alaska was completed fifty years ago, meaning that vast amounts of digital data and new taxonomic work remain poorly integrated; this is a major barrier to tracking the changing distribution of native Alaskan plants and new arrivals.  This project will build the digital infrastructure to integrate names, herbarium specimens, images, citizen science observations, and taxonomic histories and descriptions. It will be innovative in using ""taxon concepts"" to weave together the data resources. Taxon concepts offer a level of information precision beyond that of scientific plant names alone, but have yet to be used in a multi-resource database such as this; a sub-goal of the project is to promote and facilitate the use of taxon concepts more widely. As the data infrastructure is developed, the database will be populated with existing digital and scanned-paper information about the plants of Alaska, and with new data (keys, taxonomic accounts) to be generated through the collaboration of stakeholders in a new Flora of Alaska. The project will also engage the wider community of plant enthusiasts to expand contemporary species occurrence data by incorporating iNaturalist observations. Project staff will give training workshops, and travel to Alaskan villages to work with teachers, thus involving Alaskan youth in the vital process of monitoring shifts in plant distributions.   <br/><br/>This project will build an online resource that integrates the most important information about the vascular plants of Alaska. It will link the new checklist of Alaskan plant names, a product of years of research by staff of the Herbarium of the University of Alaska (ALA), and the Alaska Center for Conservation Science (ACCS), to online flora resources (the Pan-Arctic Flora and the Flora of North America), and to information digitized from Hulten's Flora of Alaska, which is the standard reference work but now nearly fifty years old. This database will link taxonomic entities to data about the physical specimens in the herbarium and in other herbaria around the world, and to geo-referenced observations of plants throughout the state, showing images of digitized specimens and of plants in the field (via iNaturalist). The project will also engage in cutting-edge deconstruction of text descriptions in its constituent floras, parsing out data on phenotypic characters of each taxon, and presenting these data in the form of identification resources and contributions to plant knowledge-bases. At the core of this data integration will be informatics infrastructure based on taxon concepts, which capture not just the names of plants, but also the historical sense in which those names were used: the hypotheses of taxonomists. To populate this taxon concept data layer, we will develop and participate in a workflow for taxon concept mapping among names used in a core set of Alaskan flora publications. Project staff will actively engage with the community of Alaskan botanists in the development of a new Flora of Alaska. Data generated by stakeholders (including taxon reviews and occurrence data) will be incorporated into the project data platform. Beyond the contribution of significantly advancing our knowledge of the plants of Alaska, this project will benefit  the university and society by training graduate and undergraduate students in biodiversity informatics and taxonomy, and engaging with training of K-12 teachers in rural villages of Alaska.

Marine organisms are being physiologically challenged by these environmental changes across their life stages, which then impacts their performance and survival, and ultimately endangering overall ecosystem balance. Such changes are particularly pronounced in very productive, high-latitude marine systems where many organisms are often finely tuned to their specific environment.  Hence, there is a great need to better monitor and understand the changes, the rates of changes, and how these changes affect the marine organisms. This project specifically improves the ability to accurately characterize the current physical and chemical ocean environment with state-of-the-art oceanic sensors, and the ability to test the response of marine organisms to future environmental changes with an innovative ocean change experimental system (OCES). The location of this project is the Kasitsna Bay Laboratory (https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/about-us/locations/kasitsna-bay/) and the surrounding waters of Kachemak Bay, in south-central Alaska. The region is valued for its diverse marine habitat types and rich marine life, which support extensive marine fisheries and subsistence harvests. Results of this study are, therefore, highly valuable for local stakeholders but results also are transferable to stakeholders in other high-latitude systems. Through the association with the University of Alaska Fairbanks, the environmental data collection and the experiments that can be done with the OCES add to the education of a new generation of scientists. The public and general research community is informed of these data and research possibilities through outreach activities and presentations at various scientific and public forums, on websites, social media, and through workshops. These data are available for the broader public through publicly available databases (e.g., the Alaska Ocean Observing System, the Alaska Ocean Acidification Network).<br/><br/>The project uses a series of instruments that are deployed in the ocean along a glacial gradient to measure ocean acidity (pH), temperature, salinity, and oxygen. These measurements are done at high resolution, every few hours, to characterize the present environmental conditions with the inherent short-term changes based on tidal cycles and daily weather conditions. In addition, the project includes an OCES laboratory system, where the current conditions can be manipulated into future ocean scenarios, including altering ocean acidification, temperature, salinity, and oxygen.  This allows for the testing of the responses of individual organisms of interest, such as in their development, growth rates, metabolic rates, etc., under predicted future ocean conditions with comparison to measurements under current conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The balance between uptake and release of these quantities influences both the Arctic region and the global climate system.  The terrestrial cycling of carbon, water, and energy are strongly linked, and therefore need to be studied at the same time and in the same place. This project continues long-term measurements of carbon, water, and energy balance in terrestrial and freshwater systems in the Alaskan Arctic, extending measurements that began in 2007.  Carbon loss over the winter has recently increased dramatically at one of our study sites, as winter air and soil temperatures have warmed. This study will determine whether these losses continue and seek to understand the underlying causes. Broader impacts of this project include contributions to teaching and learning, including underrepresented groups, support of undergraduate summer research, participation in the Marine Biology Laboratory Logan Science Journalism program and the Arctic LTER Schoolyard program, and outreach to K-12 schools in Fairbanks, Alaska, and to Native Alaskan communities. This project will support career development of two female Principal Investigators at UAF.<br/><br/>The proposed research will extend continuous measurements of carbon, water, and energy balance in three tundra ecosystems near Imnavait Creek, Alaska. Ecosystem/atmosphere flux measurements have been collected at these sites via eddy covariance since 2007. Long-term monitoring of hydrology and stream chemistry of Imnavait Creek and depth of thaw in its catchment area will be maintained. Additional measurements to help interpret these data will include water table depth, plant community composition, and vegetation greenness via reflectivity, which is related to leaf area and biomass. Long-term measurements of stream chemistry and discharge are also available at Imnavait, enabling a comprehensive assessment of carbon budgets.  All data will be made publicly available and archived at the Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) web site, the International Arctic Research Center Data Archive, and the Advanced Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (ACADIS).<br/>"

This comes at a time of increasing U.S. federal debt, declining Alaska state oil revenues, and shrinking state and federal budgets. It therefore seems unwise for rural Alaskan communities to expect state and federal agencies to adequately address the challenges they face. Instead, it is more in keeping with Alaska Native traditions to seek solutions that provide greater community self-reliance. This project will support a strategic planning workshop to develop a framework for community-initiated self-reliance. It is widely recognized that Alaska is facing large directional changes to which communities must adapt. However, there is currently no framework for designing or implementing such adaptations. The proposed research will design such a framework and initiate steps toward its implementation. This constitutes fundamental research on the processes of social-ecological transformation. The proposed planning workshop provides an opportunity to integrate local and native wisdom and knowledge with western science (e.g., climate change projections) in the context of policies and institutions whose suitability to support adaptation is currently unclear.<br/><br/>The workshop proposed by the Working Group on Rural Alaska Self-Reliance (WGRAS) will develop a plan for pilot community adaptation projects whereby University of Alaska resources are partnered with Alaskan communities to address locally identified challenges to self-reliance and sustainability through holistic, interdisciplinary, effective, and accessible processes. This provides a framework for adaptation planning by rural Alaskan communities that will enable them to develop and seek ways to implement their vision of self-reliance in a rapidly changing world. The proposed workshop will provide the framework by which that demonstration project could be implemented."

The project will document the cultural histories, social interactions, population diversity and dispersal, and environmental changes from data collected at Cape Espenberg and in relation to the greater Bering Strait and Arctic regions.  The research team will work together with community members in Shishmaref to conduct archaeological excavation, paleoecology and ancient DNA research to better understand who were the people that first settled the area around AD 1000, when and from where they came, and in what environmental conditions these events took place. At the same time they will work with cultural advisers and Shishmaref community members who have ancestral ties to the area to explore how material culture and landscape is interpreted to talk about the past and tell history.  The project will promote progress of science and education by conducting basic research and developing new methods in the several research fields involved. By insuring and promoting proper conservation of artifacts the project, will increase awareness and capacity to preserve the growing catalog of perishable organic artifacts, increasingly exposed due to eroding coastal and thawing permafrost. By including indigenous perspectives on material culture, the research will promote an archaeology that is more receptive to multiple voices. The project will also foster national and international collaborations between four US research institutes, a French University (U. of Panthéon Sorbonne), a rural Alaska community and a regional non-profit corporation. Associated with the project a variety of initiatives represent opportunities in research, education and training for a number of underrepresented Alaska minorities, women, and undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>The aims of this multidisciplinary program of research is to explore human interaction, settlement history, climate and landscape dynamics in relation to the Birnirk archaeological complex at ca. AD 1000. After a period of hiatus, Birnirk site KTZ-304 at Cape Espenberg (Inuigniq) was occupied at a pivotal cultural and environmental moment in Northwest Alaska and the larger Bering Sea region, just before AD 1000 and prior to the emergence of Inupiaq culture around AD 1300. Cape Espenberg is a key location for this cultural history both because of the presence of Ipiutak, Birnik and Thule archaeological sites and as ancestral land of today's Kigiqtaamiut of Shishmaref. Interrelated and integrated analytical approaches involving cultural and physical anthropology, archaeology and paleoecology will (a) form the framework for continued excavation at site KTZ-304 (b) contribute to study architectural features, archaeofauna, ceramics, and artifacts in order to elucidate social networks, subsistence systems and technology, and to understand the impact of climate and resource availability on peoples activities, decisions and movements; (c) guide the collecting of paleoenvironmental data through targeted sampling of swales and ridges to date dune ridge stabilization, reconstruct terrestrial vegetation and map the location of the ocean relative to the site; (d) integrate ancient DNA (aDNA) studies to establish the broader genetic relationships of Inuit societies in the region and beyond; (e) explore how Kigiqtaamiut interpret material culture to understand the past, narrate history and generate knowledge (f) foster a dialog on the role of material culture today in the community of Shishmaref and in between the Kigiqtaamiut and the scientists to construct more reflexive interpretations of the past, and thus (g) advance understanding of the origin of Inupiaq culture through the development of a high-resolution chronology of settlement and landscape formation, cultural shift and climate variation."

The highest mountain in North America, Mount McKinley (6,196 m), is situated on the inside of a 17 degree bend in the mapped trace of the Denali fault. North of the Denali fault, on the outside of this bend, the highest peak is Peter's Dome (3,221 m) with elevations rapidly decreasing away from the Denali fault to an aggradational basin less than 15 km to the north. This topographic asymmetry suggests a strong structural control on local exhumation patterns and that this restraining bend has been a primary control on regional orogenic development for several million years. The study will apply a multi-thermochronometer approach to constraining exhumation rates and timing along the Mount McKinley restraining bend in conjunction with a neotectonic/structural analysis of fault patterns and slip rates. The researchers will employ radiocarbon, optically stimulated luminescence, and in-situ terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide surface exposure dating techniques to provide age control for the major deformed landforms in this study area. Furthermore, insights from this study will be compared to the evolution of complex fault geometries along other strike-slip faults and the recognition of transient and persistent uplift/exhumation phenomena in the geologic record.<br/><br/>Major intracontinental strike-slip faults around the world exhibit abrupt changes in the fault geometry over relatively short distances, often occurring as bends or step-over zones between fault segments. These zones of complex fault geometry are often associated with significant uplift or subsidence adjacent to the fault. Understanding how the horizontal displacement along the broader strike-slip system is partitioned into horizontal and vertical components in these complex fault zones is an ongoing focus of research in tectonics. In particular, contractional zones (i.e., restraining bends) that result from a change in fault geometry along a strike-slip fault require significant deformation adjacent to the fault for the crust to continue along the path of long-term horizontal motion. Therefore, it would seem that these zones would evolve toward a straight fault segment: yet restraining bends persist. Developing new slip rate data for the Denali fault and adjacent faults will provide key insights into the modern tectonic framework and constrain potential boundaries of proposed crustal blocks. Furthermore, insights from this study will: 1) allow comparison to the structural complexities along other strike-slip faults such as the San Andreas and Alpine faults; 2) help further understanding of how crustal blocks interact within broad deforming zones of continental crust 3) aid the recognition of transient and persistent uplift/exhumation phenomena in the geologic record. The research team will work closely with educators at the Watershed School in Fairbanks, Alaska, to develop educational plans and materials to foster student interest in science through place-based education. The communication of the scientific advances made through this project will be promoted through close collaboration with Denali National Park and Preserve staff. With numerous previously unknown faults occurring in this seismically-active region, results from this study will contribute significantly to regional seismic hazard assessments."

Deglaciation of this region began with the end of the Little Ice Age, and continues today, raising sea level and producing dramatic uplift and gravity change. Today?s spectacular Glacier Bay was created by the rapid tidewater retreat of glaciers beginning around 1800; glaciers originally well over 1 km thick in places disappeared in a few decades, with their ice discharged into the ocean. The land rises up as the weight of the ice is removed, causing uplift easily measured by precise surveying using the Global Positioning System (GPS), and causing changes in Earth's gravity field that can be measured at the surface or from space. However, post-glacial uplift does not occur at a steady rate; the ground subsides slightly throughout the winter before uplifting rapidly from the onset of the spring melt until subsidence begins again the next winter. These variations are dominated by hydrological loading, mainly due to the seasonal accumulation and melting of snow and ice. The seasonal variations here are larger than predicted by large-scale hydrologic models, which do not account for snow and ice well. <br/><br/>The investigators of this study will look at variations in height of the land surface and of gravity, and use these measurements to develop regional models of the changes in mass of water, snow and ice in the region and carry out these measurements and modeling in collaboration with scientists at Tohoku University (Japan), and Scott Luthcke at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Including absolute gravity measurements, made by the Japanese colleagues, they will test and refine regional GIA models, and test whether the uplift rates are accelerating with the recent increase in ice mass loss rate. They will continue operation of 6 GPS sites installed with our Japanese colleagues, analysis and modeling of the GPS (including PBO) and GRACE data, and will develop a regional model of hydrological load variations for the time span of GRACE data, and extend the model back in time using the longer GPS time series. The hydrological load model will likely represent a large improvement over large-scale hydrologic models such as NASA's Global Land Data Assimilation System, which are difficult to constrain in data-poor regions such as Alaska.<br/><br/>This project will improve our understanding of the hydrology of southeast Alaska. Freshwater discharge into the Gulf of Alaska affects marine habitat and may alter the patterns of the Alaska coastal current. The model will provide new information on the distribution and timing of runoff, which are important for oceanographic and biological studies, and will be of value as additional input into ocean salinity models and habitat distribution models. The methods for combining GRACE, GPS data and hydrological models will provide a template for application of these approaches to other regions. Ultimately these methods will provide more accurate estimates of the glacier contribution to rising sea level. They will continue to inform the public and National Park Service personnel of research results, and this work will provide new information to them about the magnitude and distribution of snow accumulation and melt in the region."

The problem of understanding postseismic deformation cannot be separated from the problem of understanding the shallow seismogenic zone; we measure the sum of the two. For the postseismic deformation, the investigators aim to determine the relative importance of creep/afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation in explaining the present and cumulative postseismic observations. Is a combination of the two classes of mechanisms required to explain the observations? If so, what is their relative importance? For variations in plate coupling, they aim to delineate as well as possible where the boundaries between strongly and weakly coupled zones lie. How sharp are these boundaries?

Mathematics and science courses, which are delivered primarily via audio- <br/>conference to rural students, will be enhanced through this project with culturally responsive <br/>pedagogies, face-to-face learning intensives, academic tutoring, and increased contact with <br/>STEM faculty. Students will also gain research experience through projects designed around <br/>the theme of ?ecology of place? to engage, educate, and retain rural Alaska Native students in <br/>STEM degrees. Elders and STEM faculty will work together to support the students using an <br/>integrative approach. Program objectives are built around gains in student participation, <br/>persistence, grade point averages and graduations of rural Alaska Native students with a <br/>replicable model for reaching underserved populations as a primary goal of evaluation.  <br/>"

The causes and consequences of coupled vesiculation and crystallization kinetics in ascending basaltic andesite magmas. <br/> <br/>Explosive eruptions involving mafic magmas pose important implications for hazards near active volcanoes. In particular, Strombolian eruptions produce large volumes of fine ash, high ash plumes, and large dispersal areas that may severely impact surrounding populations. Numerous studies suggest that explosivity is related to expulsion of gases from ascending, decompressing magmas that in turn depends on porosity-permeability properties of the magma and fragmentation style. In an attempt to elucidate the degassing process and its effect on eruptive style, it is proposed to investigate experimentally the development of permeability in experimentally decompressed mafic silicate melts with particular focus on the role of crystallization in mafic magmas as a control on eruptive style. Specifically, how does syn-ascent microlite crystallization influence development of connected vesicle networks and the percolation threshold, and how do these factors influence gas separation in the conduit and transitions in eruptive style?  Hypotheses to be tested include: [1] Are crystal number densities related directly to decompression rate (i.e., due to rapid crystallization of hydrous mafic melts during vesiculation)? 2) Is melt permeability inversely related to magma viscosity? 3) Does decompression­driven crystallization change the percolation threshold (i.e., by limiting bubble expansion or by spatial control on bubble placement)? 4) Does decompression rate affect the style of mafic eruptions by controlling degassing efficiency and the depth and efficiency of syn­eruptive crystallization?  These questions will be investigated via  decompression experiments on synthetic basaltic andesite melts similar in composition to those erupted at Okmok volcano (Alaska), and with both pure water and mixed H2O­CO2 fluid phase to examine the influence of CO2 on crystallization and vesiculation kinetics. The experiments will be compared with natural samples from the mid­Holocene Middle Scoria Okmok volcano, which produced violent strombolian to subplinian and vulcanian eruption deposits.  A ?permeameter? will be constructed to measure permeabilities of both experimental and natural samples to estimate percolation thresholds, and the results will be used to model gas segregation and fragmentation during explosive mafic eruptions. <br/> <br/>Broader Impacts: This project will support a PhD student, and undergraduate student assistant at UAF. A new link will be forged with the UAF Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program (ANSEP) with the aim to hire Alaska Native undergraduate student(s) to perform research for the project. The project will also involve international collaboration with volcanologist Kathy Cashman (University of Bristol). The PI?s association with the Alaska Volcano Observatory also facilitates application of this research to assessment of volcanic hazards related to violent mafic eruptions at active volcanoes in Alaska and Cascadia. Development of new research equipment in the UAF Experimental Petrology lab will also enhance the infrastructure at UAF and provide new equipment that could fill research needs beyond geology and volcanology studies, including applications in other physical sciences and engineering disciplines."

NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, and integrates the co-production of knowledge. This award fulfills part of that aim.<br/><br/>Ice-rich permafrost is ground that is frozen all year round for two or more years and contains particularly large amounts of water that will be released upon thawing. This ice is the element of Arctic landscapes most susceptible to climate warming. Nearly 50% of the Arctic has ice-rich permafrost. For example, the upper 4-5 meters of the land along Alaska's northern coast contains an estimated 77% ice. Thawing of ice-rich permafrost affects entire arctic ecosystems and makes the ground unstable to build upon. Thus, ice-rich permafrost is conceived as having a role similar to that of a 'keystone species' in ecology, whereby if the keystone element is removed or drastically reduced, the entire system is radically changed. To better understand the intricate connections between the ice-rich permafrost and the larger arctic human-ecological system, this project is exploring how differences in climate, snow, water, level of disturbance, and time influence the accumulation and loss of ground ice in permafrost landscapes and how people and their infrastructure can adapt to changing ice-rich permafrost. The goal is to understand ice-rich permafrost at local, regional, and circumpolar scales. <br/><br/>The project will focus in the Prudhoe Bay oilfield and the village of Point Lay, Alaska, where permafrost temperatures are changing rapidly and there are large impacts to ecosystems, industrial infrastructure, and local communities. Both areas contain excellent examples of ice-rich permafrost-related problems relevant to many other areas of Alaska and circumpolar Arctic, so the work will have broad applications elsewhere. Three ice-rich permafrost observatories are proposed: 1) a Roadside Ice-rich Permafrost Observatory in the Prudhoe Bay Oilfield; 2) a Natural Ice-rich Permafrost Observatory remote from infrastructure; and 3) a Village Ice-rich Permafrost Observatory at Point Lay. Ground-level observations of ground ice, hydrology, vegetation, and greenhouse-gas fluxes are being conducted and remote sensing is being used to measure and monitor changes from space. Much of the response to infrastructure damage caused by severe thermokarst (thaw-related subsidence of the ground surface) is repair and stabilization of existing structures. There is an immediate need to develop more strategic approaches to mitigate damage and adapt to change. Point Lay, Alaska, is experiencing some of the most severe ice-rich permafrost-related impacts of any place in the Arctic but has received relatively little research and agency attention. Researchers from the University of Alaska's Institute of Arctic Biology, Institute of Northern Engineering, and Geophysical Institute are working together with the Cold Climate Housing Research Center (CCHRC), the Point Lay community, the Regional Housing Authority, and North Slope Borough to address these issues. Wherever possible the team are using local experience with ice-rich permafrost to help develop housing strategies relevant to many arctic villages facing similar impacts. The project partners are working with local residents, government agencies, the oil industry, and the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities to develop best practices for road and house construction and related education materials. A post-doctoral student, a graduate student, and two undergraduate students will be part of the research team. The results will be communicated to circumpolar communities and the broader public and through the Rapid Arctic Transitions due to Infrastructure and Climate (RATIC) action group of the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) and the Terrestrial Multidisciplinary distributed Observatories for the Study of Arctic Connections (T-MOSAiC).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, this project prompts collaborative engagements with the increasing challenges to fossil fuel development in northern Alaska, including: eroding coastlines, petroleum-dependent subsistence activities, plans for new offshore drilling, dwindling dividends,and unprecedented environmental shifts. Seeking to involve Native communities within wider conversations across research and policy around these concerns, this project is inspired by innovative community efforts to secure subsistence, insure wellbeing, and create viable cultural futures in a context of rapid change. By building a unique regional research alliance around these insights, the project also aims to revise common understandings about some of the most pressing topics of our times, including health and wellness, inequality, changing ecosystems, and the prospects of a petroleum-based social contract in Alaska. This project will directly benefit partner communities, science and scientific communities, policy-makers and efforts to strengthen American democracy.<br/> <br/>The project makes three primary contributions to publicly relevant social science research focused on Arctic futures. First, it develops a collaborative method that empowers Alaska Native community research partners to design, coordinate, and implement research questions and activities within their own communities.  Second, a decolonizing methodology endeavors to rethink the analytic lexicons of Arctic social science research, and thus to revise scholarly approaches to some of the biggest issues of the present, including the ways that knowledge about Arctic futures is negotiated and co-produced. Finally, this project maximizes the broader impacts of this knowledge by laying the foundation for a wider research network that brings Indigenous and scientific insights to bear on the most critical public problems in northern Alaska today. Findings from the study will also advance conversations in several bodies of scholarship concerned with decolonizing methodologies, shifting Arctic ecologies and economies, and Indigenous wellbeing.  In such ways, the project will engage current debates by creating a more inclusive exploration of the Arctic and its open-ended futures.  "

Results of climate model simulations and conceptual  paleoclimate scenarios provide hypotheses to be tested against the  geologic record.

This award supports a study of the flux of Holocene fluvial sediment into the Gulf of Alaska, whose generally small tributary rivers are collectively the largest supplier of sediment from North America.  Alaskan rivers are relatively uninfluenced by human activities, although glacial activity has resulted in higher sediment yields than noted for other rivers with similar drainage areas.  The investigation will employ high-resolution seismic profiling for the identification of sediment accumulation and discharge patterns on the shelf and slope, and to trace individual sediment layers derived from episodic (flood) events.  Sedimentological data will help define the escape routes/processes, and a variety of radiometric datings will show frequency of occurrence and rates of accumulation.  Measurements of total organic carbon and total nitrogen, del13C, del15N, and lignin will be used to determine the amount and source of organic matter accumulating in the sediments.  Contemporaneous oceanographic processes controlling strata formation will also be evaluated.  This information should help in the interpretation of the older strata observed by seismic profiling and coring."

The principal vehicle to accomplish these goals is a National Science Foundation sponsored curriculum, ""Adapting Yup'ik Elders' Knowledge.""  This curriculum includes culturally relevant topics such as salmon fishing, kayaking, orienting and navigating.  Including Native knowledge in the classroom may decrease the long-standing tension between school and community, which often leads to high teacher turnover.<br/><br/>The instructional components of the project include three-week Summer Institutes, follow-up workshops in the communities, online support and community math activities. The Summer Institutes are devoted to the integration of culture, pedagogy and content knowledge through the use of the Adapting Yup'ik Elders' Knowledge curriculum.  Through hands-on and inquiry-oriented sessions, participants generate questions, work in peer-assisted groups and keep journals as they explore mathematics, teaching and culture.  As a teaching tool, the project uses videotapes from Alaskan classrooms, from other classrooms using culturally-based math programs and from international studies on math teaching and learning.  Participants of the Summer Institutes receive credit for three University courses:  Geometry and Spatial Reasoning; Algebraic Thinking; and Pedagogy, Content and Culture.  The follow-up workshops occur in each community and involve teachers, elders, students and families.  To further support the mentors and novice teachers, there are three audio conferences during the school year and on-line support via the use of Blackboard.  <br/>The project also involves a large research study.  The Principal Investigator uses both quantitative and qualitative research methods to investigate (a) the relationship between the teacher training component and teacher knowledge, attitude and performance, and (b) the effects of these processes on Alaska Native and Yup'ik student mathematics learning.<br/><br/>"

In this second workshop, specific materials and manufacturing aspects will be discussed in detail. A major objective of the workshop is to bring together leading experts in materials research and manufacturing. Items that are to be discussed include materials issues in extreme environments, such as sub-zero temperatures and remote locations with particular attention to stimulate ideas to direct new or existing materials into commercial products such as those needed for transport surfaces, pipelines, entertainment, and communication. The goal of the workshop is to draft a short and long-term plan for Alaskan materials development and manufacturing.<br/><br/>There are many challenging issues related to materials and manufacturing aspects pertaining to the extreme environmental conditions and remote access in Alaska. Roads, harbors, and buildings in arctic environments are generally built on permafrost and seismically unstable locations, and thus must function at sub-zero temperatures. There is a need for technological development of materials with regard to the special needs of the extreme arctic environment such as the effect on the landscape, energy consumption, and potential accidents. The preservation of the Alaskan environment is paramount in any commercial development. The workshop enables participation of experts from academia, government and industrial institutions in Alaska, surrounding countries and other parts of the United States. Efforts will be made to invite and recruit minorities. The organizers of the workshop will review the abstracts and potential candidates with possible collaborations will be given priority.

Today, salmon make up the largest proportion of wild foods harvested by rural Alaskans, but the availability of this important subsistence resource is declining in many upriver areas. Research on prehistoric salmon abundance and use can provide data critical to understanding natural variation in salmon availability and how northern riverine peoples have responded to fluctuations in this important resource in the past.  By providing a long-term perspective for sustainability and food security planning, project data will benefit a variety of salmon stakeholders within Alaska and beyond. The project has a strong educational component, including the development and delivery of a project-based course for the Rural Alaska Honors Institute (a college preparatory program for rural and Alaska Native college-bound students), thus enhancing opportunities for underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This project will address three questions:  (1) How has salmon abundance varied over time in central Alaska? (2) When did prehistoric foragers begin to use salmon, and when did they begin to intensively exploit this resource? (3) How did foragers respond to changes in salmon availability? To address these questions, a multidisciplinary team will use independent approaches: (a) stable isotope analysis of human and faunal remains will reveal the contribution of salmon to the diets of prehistoric salmon consumers (e.g., humans, dogs, bears); (b) zooarchaeological and ancient DNA analyses of fish remains from existing faunal assemblages will allow reconstruction of past fish procurement and processing strategies; and (c) stable isotope analysis of interior lake sediment cores will track natural fluctuations in salmon abundance.  These data will be integrated with models of forager economy and mobility to explore cultural responses to salmon abundance through multiple prehistoric periods. This research will provide the necessary faunal isotope data to accurately reconstruct overall paleodiets of newly discovered multiple human individuals at the interior sites of Upward Sun River (~11,500 yrs old) and Tochak (~1000 yrs old), where faunal and initial isotopic data suggest significant salmon use.  This project provides unprecedented time depth on natural variation in salmon abundance in the North Pacific and in understanding how northern peoples have responded to changes in this critical resource in the past. The study will produce much-needed direct data bearing on prehistoric subsistence strategies in the Alaskan interior throughout the period of human occupation."

The NGA is a highly productive subarctic biome where intense environmental variability has profound impacts on lower trophic level organisms and community dynamics that, directly or indirectly, support the iconic fish, crabs, seabirds and marine mammals of Alaska. In the NGA, a pronounced spring bloom and regions of sustained summer production support a stable base of energy-rich zooplankton grazers and a substantial sinking flux of organic matter, thereby efficiently transferring primary production up the food chain and contributing to carbon export. The LTER research team will examine features, mechanisms and processes that drive this productivity and system-wide resilience to understand how short- and long-term climate variability propagates through the environment to influence organisms. This highly productive biome will provide a valuable new component to the LTER network by investigating marine ecosystem changes in a region impacted by warming surface ocean trends, and by leveraging a strong climate context provided by two decades of prior observations and a rich history of coupled biological-physical modeling to advance prediction of ecosystem response to perturbation. To complement the observational and modeling efforts, the NGA LTER includes an Education & Outreach component that will develop videos highlighting the understanding gained from this research, and the activities of scientists in ocean-related STEM careers. These products will be presented to the public through various high-traffic venues, will be incorporated into virtual field trips for K-12 students, and will be available to the LTER network. The NGA LTER program will also serve as a platform to train graduate and undergraduate students across disciplines and in cutting-edge field and data-analysis techniques. Finally, synthetic activities will aid in effective ecosystem-based management of commercially important fisheries in Alaska.<br/><br/>The research focus of the NGA LTER site will be on mechanistic understanding of processes that underlie environmental variability, and the role of the latter in promoting high productivity and resilience. Building on prior knowledge, the investigators will test three hypotheses centered on ecosystem emergent properties: 1. Changes in the hydrologic cycle affect spring bloom production through changes in cloud cover, the stratification/mixing balance, macro- and micronutrient supplies, and transport pathways. 2. Hot-spots of high summer primary and secondary production result from interactions between the fresher Alaska Coastal Current and more saline offshore waters as promoted by shelf morphology and regional winds; hot spot timing and magnitude will be influenced by changes in the hydrologic cycle. 3. Nutritional and life history patterns of NGA consumers minimize trophic mismatch, buffering spatial and temporal variability in lower trophic level production and leading to resilience in the face of long-term climate change.  The investigators will address these hypotheses with an integrated research program that includes: a) seasonal time series studies addressing short- and long-term environmental and ecosystem variability through a spring-to-fall field cruise- and mooring-based observational program, building upon and enhancing the Seward Line times series, and leveraging existing collaborations to obtain higher trophic level data; b) process studies that focus on hypothesized mechanisms leading to variability and enhancement of NGA production in time and space; c) modeling studies that incorporate physical and biogeochemical observations, provide a framework for testing hypotheses, and predict ecosystem responses to projected environmental changes; d) a data management component that provides a public platform for data visualization and synthesis by LTER colleagues, educators & students, and resource managers."

The amplification comes from thawing permafrost (frozen soils) that release greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide and methane, that lead to additional warming, more thaw, and more greenhouse gases released.  However, how fast the permafrost will thaw, how much greenhouse gas will be released, and how important gradual thaw is versus abrupt thaw caused by melting ground ice or floods, is unknown.  This Arctic Observing Network research will document changes in permafrost thaw, greenhouse gas releases, and energy balance in terrestrial and freshwater systems in the Alaskan and Russian Arctic.  Arctic ecosystems have seen an acceleration of permafrost thaw and greenhouse gas release to the atmosphere that may not be easily reversed.  Further observations are required to determine the rates of change and potential impacts on climate to best inform society on what to expect and how to prepare.  In addition to advancing understanding of environmental change, broader impacts of the research include contributions to teaching, learning, and outreach by including findings in school classrooms, support of undergraduate summer research, and outreach to Indigenous communities and K-12 schools in Alaska.  Two communities in the Alaskan and Russian Arctic will learn to map methane bubbling hotspots that create dangerous ice, which will result in co-production of knowledge and improved safety for winter travelers.  Other benefits to society include improved understanding of how permafrost thaw threatens roads and buildings, and how a thawing Arctic influences climate change at lower latitudes.<br/><br/>This research will extend time-series data on carbon, water, and energy balance in four different tundra ecosystems in northern Alaska (year-round eddy covariance measured since 2007), and at two sites in Cherskii, Russia.  The records already collected show evidence of recent change and tipping points, highlighting the value of supporting long-term measurements.  In addition, carbon dioxide and methane fluxes measured by eddy covariance and ebullition will be monitored in a new thermokarst lake in Siberia, and ebullition will be measured on existing and new Alaskan and Siberian lakes mapped using remote sensing.  Long-term monitoring of hydrology and stream chemistry of Imnavait Creek, Alaska, and depth of thaw in its catchment will be maintained and expanded.  To help interpret these core data, the project will continue camera records of plant phenology and dates of snowmelt and snow return, harvests to assess plant biomass and net primary productivity, and analysis of soil properties and stocks of carbon and nitrogen.  Permafrost boreholes will be instrumented near eddy covariance towers at Imnavait Creek and near the new lake in Cherskii. All data will continue to be made publicly available and archived with the Arctic Data Center, NSF-LTER Data Portal, and Ameriflux.  Data collected by this project will be used extensively by other researchers and incorporated into other observing networks such as Ameriflux, the Phenocam Network, and other efforts including NASA projects and satellite campaigns.  Research will also be disseminated though scientific publications and presentations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For individuals, it can imply significant welfare gains. For the country as a whole, it can imply not only improvement in energy independence but also attaining environmental goals. The research team proposes to investigate the reasons why individuals fail to adopt seemingly adaptive conservation technologies and behaviors. The proposal is based on a series of studies that combine field experiments and data analysis of large policies initiatives in the state of Alaska. <br/><br/>Heating costs throughout the polar North stress community resilience. Cold is extreme, hydrocarbon prices volatile, and local opportunity to adjust cash income to price shocks limited. Energy conservation would appear adaptive, and the State of Alaska provides substantial subsidies to facilitate household energy conservation. Despite this, relatively few adopt energy efficient technologies to reduce home heating costs. The research team proposes three related studies to understand why. The project explores individual decision rules, the role of cash payoffs, information, and nuisance and other hidden costs of making investments to reduce energy for space and hot water heat. <br/><br/>The project is focused on discovering opportunities to design better policy. Taking seriously the complexity of household decision-making, it will produce new information on engineering models, behavioral models, program effectiveness and policy alternatives. It will generate the first publically available data on household heating oil use -- a critical input to Northern energy policy.   The project works collaboratively with local stakeholders, agencies, and academic communities, which will produce lessons for building future effective partnerships.  Finally, the project entails substantial outreach and training with local participants through direct participation in the project in combination with educational opportunities.<br/><br/>The first part of the research project jointly analyzes participant records in Alaska's Home Energy Rebate Program (HERP), which subsidizes investments to reduce space and hot water heat, and gas utility billing records. Detailed program and energy consumption data permit assessment of both program-predicted and actual household payoffs, point to investments that may occur for reasons other than energy conservation, and indicate cost-effective investments not pursued. This analysis will reveal the way decisions about conservation are made in the face of relevant information and their effectiveness in producing energy savings. <br/><br/>The second part of the research measures the comparative importance of hidden, non-pecuniary costs of completing the HERP's initial home energy assessment. We will conduct a field experiment that systematically isolates and removes participant costs and uncertainty from the task. Also, the incentives to gather technology information will give causal evidence of the importance of information on HERP participation and completion. <br/><br/>The third part of the research project measures behavioral impacts of providing rural consumers real-time information on their consumption and expenditures for heat. Essentially all rural Alaskan households use heating oil as primary heat source, but consumer ability to map realized costs of behavior is limited: Costs are observed only when the fuel oil tank is refilled, which may occur as little as 2-3 times a year. By deploying new heating oil metering technology developed by the Alaska Center for Energy and Power specifically for remote rural application, we assess behavioral effects of a dramatic increase in information. This study will generate the first Alaska dataset of measured residential heating oil demand. <br/><br/>The proposal will significantly improve knowledge of the complex reasons why seemingly adaptive energy efficiency investments are not made. The research team will access information not previously available to researchers, and conduct experiments to create counterfactuals that observational data cannot deliver, to: better understand the motivations of adopters; recalibrate engineering models of building energy use to incorporate human behavior; measure the causal effect of pecuniary incentives in the adoption of energy savings technologies; produce a novel dataset of actual demand for heating oil in rural Alaska; determine the importance of hidden costs as a barrier to energy conservation program participation."

The goals of the proposed research are to: (1) document the current status and trends in ecosystem services in the arctic and boreal forest, (2) project future trends in these services, and (3) assess the societal consequences of altered ecosystem services. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this research derives from several sources, including: (1) provision of a qualitative assessment of status and trends in a comprehensive suite of ecosystem services at scales ranging from individual communities to the pan-arctic, (2) provision of a quantitative regional assessment of historical and likely future trends of those ecosystem services that are of greatest concern to Alaskan communities, substantially enhancing the capacity to predict the societal consequences of climate change for Alaskan communities and policy makers, (3) involvement of Alaskan communities in the design, implementation, and use of research to ensure from the outset that the research directly meets stakeholder needs, (4) networking with other research groups to share research results as an integral component of the program, and (5) collaboration with similar research programs in other arctic nations to achieve a pan-arctic synthesis of status and trends in ecosystem services. <br/><br/>The broader impacts include: (1) inclusion of indigenous communities as <br/>integral components of the research team (rather than as passive recipients of research results), empowering local communities to understand present and future options for adaptation to climate change, (2) communication of research products that are immediately useful for policy formulation by communities and agencies as an integral component of the process, (3) training of Alaska Natives at PhD, undergraduate, and high-school levels to conduct research on the ecological and societal consequences of climate change, (4) directly addressing critical a missing link in most global change research - quantitative assessment of causes, consequences, and likely future trajectories of those ecosystem services that are of greatest concern to society, and (5) leaving a legacy of spatially explicit time series of data and maps of ecosystem services and their likely future trends. <br/><br/>The research addresses IPY/understanding environmental change because it focuses on: (1) understanding relationships among climate changes, ecosystems and society, including mechanisms that control these relationships at multiple spatial scales, (2) understanding relationships among environmental change and ecosystem services and their socio-economic consequences in polar regions, (3) launching new initiatives that are interdisciplinary in nature, leave a data legacy, and eng gage the public, and (4) using LTER and AON sites and building on international collaborations. <br/><br/>"

Changes in climate will alter ecosystem structure and function, affecting the distribution of subsistence resources and access to the areas where resources are harvested. High fuel costs (e.g., heating, transportation) have forced rural households to make economic sacrifices to maintain and use equipment needed for subsistence. To address these issues, this project will: 1) document specific impacts that environmental change and energy costs are having on subsistence, 2) identify and link characteristics of the human (e.g., policy, household economics) and natural (e.g., climate patterns, landscape change) system that influence vulnerability to impacts, 3) evaluate the effectiveness of current responses to impacts, and 4) enhance communication networks among communities and researchers to foster future adaptation to globally-driven changes. Rather than considering global-change adaptation as a set of discrete actions, this research will treat actions as feedback loops that link social and ecological components at community and regional scales and will test the hypothesis that ineffective adaptation to global change results in part from weak or missing feedbacks. The project involves collaboration with local communities as well as with federal, state, and tribal organizations in Alaska to develop and enhance networks that invent, test, and share adaptations at regional and larger scales. It will enhance capacity to adapt to environmental change in Alaska by engaging community leaders and training graduate students, many of whom are Alaska Natives, in an interdisciplinary research process. Of the 14-member project team, 21% are Alaska Native, 50% are women, and 43% are early-career scholars.<br/><br/>This project will develop a novel framework (adaptive coupling) to study adaptation in social-ecological systems. It will integrates vulnerability and resilience science in a systems context. Rather than considering global-change adaptation as a set of discrete actions, it treats these as feedback loops that link social-ecological components at community and regional scales. The project will test the hypothesis that ineffective adaptation to global change results in part from weak or missing feedbacks from impacts on communities back to the local drivers or factors mediating community sensitivity to these drivers. The investigators seek to understand reasons for weak or missing feedbacks. The research will contribute to theory by integrating qualitative insights from the social sciences (especially related to political ecology and adaptive and collaborative capacities) with more quantitative information from ecology, hydrology, and economics within a systems framework. The dynamics and pathways by which adaptation scales from individual communities to a region will be investigated. In contrast to the literature on top-down diffusion of innovation from agencies to local entities, the investigators will focus on the grassroots emergence of novelty and factors that influence its regional diffusion. The focus on the interface between theory and practical application of knowledge in local communities has the potential to transform the western linear (loading dock) model of science to a more iterative adaptive approach that recognizes the intellectual value of local knowledge and the importance of real-world application as a learning laboratory."

The overall objective is to document the major controls over forest dynamics, biogeochemistry and disturbance and their interactions in the face of a changing climate. Research seeks to identify factors that buffer systems from radical changes in structure and functioning (resilience) vs. factors that might precipitate changes to alternative states (vulnerability), and is organized into three themes: forest dynamics, biogeochemistry and landscape dynamics. In this funding cycle, BNZ research will make a more direct connection to long-term monitoring data and the PIs have added several new program elements. The research design combines long-term observations and experiments with process studies to identify ecological changes and document controls over ecosystem processes in two types of successional sequences, floodplain primary succession and upland post-fire secondary succession, over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Hypotheses about controls over ecosystem dynamics are tested by manipulating selected interactive controls extended to larger spatial scales in a hierarchical research design, using extensive measurements, remote sensing, and modeling over a broad spectrum of temporal scales. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. BNZ research has broad societal implications through the understanding of impacts of climate change, disturbance, human activities and exotic species on boreal forest ecosystem services such as climate regulation, recreation, aesthetics and forest resource availability. BNZ outreach and educational components are generally very strong and effective and have numerous connections to state and federal resource management agencies. The BNZ Schoolyard LTER program has been very successful and has partnered with two other science education programs to train science teachers in 38 Alaskan towns. This has involved engaging largely under-represented students who have initiated their own long-term ecological research projects and developed their own web sites. A very creative phenology unit was developed that involves K-12 students in ground validation measurements of remotely sensed data, a first such opportunity for many children in rural Alaskan communities. This activity has now been incorporated into the GLOBE Teachers Guide and is used internationally. BNZ research provides training for undergraduate and graduate students and is connected with an innovative and exciting IGERT project. BNZ public outreach to the general public is via diverse media publicity, with participants working closely with local and regional groups concerned with sustainable forestry and Native Alaskans. The BNZ site and associated researchers have an excellent track record of research and publications with data made available and useful to a broader community through information management emphasizing secure archival of collected data, promotion of its use in synthesis, and development of web-based databases to facilitate its use by the scientific community.<br/>"

The forest dynamics theme addresses successional changes in biotic populations and communities following disturbance, emphasizing the relative importance of historical legacies, stochastic processes, and species effects in determining successional trajectories and the sensitivity of the trajectories to climate. Changes in the carbon cycle during succession hinge on changes in forest dynamics and other element cycles, but also influence nutrient availability and microenvironment and therefore successional changes in forest dynamics. Regional and landscape controls over disturbance regimes focus on processes that are responsible for the timing, extent, and severity of disturbances. Our research design uses experiments and observations at intensive sites in three successional sequences (floodplains, south-aspect uplands, north-aspect uplands) to document the processes that drive successional change. We will establish the larger context for these intensive studies by studying two large regions, a relatively uniform region in interior Alaska and along a climate gradient from the warmest to the coldest areas in Alaska. Through synthesis we will address three important ecological issues. (1) How do species characteristics and diversity influence biogeochemistry and disturbance regime within ecosystems and landscapes? (2) How can we conceptualize spatial and temporal scaling as the basis for linking processes and patterns from ecosystems across landscapes? (3) How do positive and negative feedbacks that operate within ecosystems influence the sensitivity of ecosystems (i.e., their sustainability) to perturbations, such as changes in climate and disturbance regime?<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Toward the base of this food web are small planktonic crustaceans that serve as the primary food source for many of these fish, as well as seabirds and marine mammals. The copepod Neocalanus flemingeri is one of these crustaceans, and it experiences rapid population growth during each spring's algal, or phytoplankton, bloom. An apparent mismatch between the presence of the youngest stages of the copepod, or nauplii, in early winter and the unpredictable timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom several months later raises important questions about when females reproduce and how this relates to survival and growth of nauplii. Two types of dormancy, diapause in adult females and physiological quiescence in nauplii, may be the key to the success of this copepod species. Timing and duration of the egg-laying period by adult females is linked to emergence from diapause. In addition, nauplii may enter a state of physiological quiescence while food resources are low, resuming growth after phytoplankton levels increase. This research will address a long-standing goal of biological oceanographers to understand dormancy and its role in controlling population cycles in marine copepods. It will use new technologies in molecular biology called transcriptomics to catalog the messages used by the cells to control copepod life processes, in this case those related to dormancy in adults and nauplii. Undergraduate students and a postdoctoral investigator will be trained in interdisciplinary research, and students from Native Hawaiian and Native Alaskan groups will be targeted for participation. Fishing is a major industry in the Gulf of Alaska, and outreach will focus on communicating the role copepods play in marine ecosystems. New content, including images, will be generated for existing websites: the Seward Line long-term observation program, the Alaska Ocean Observing System and the Gulf Watch Alaska Program.  <br/><br/>Recruitment to the Neocalanus flemingeri spring population is dependent on successful emergence from diapause followed by reproduction, survival, and growth of the next generation. Individual-based models have made significant progress in predicting population growth in calanoid copepods using food, temperature, and advection as key environmental factors. Few of these models include predictors for naupliar recruitment, however, because little is known about this part of the life cycle given sampling difficulties and the lack of biomarkers to evaluate physiological state. This study will leverage existing monitoring efforts to track the N. flemingeri population during the winter and early spring. The research team will combine laboratory and field approaches to determine duration and synchronization of reproduction in emerging females and strategies for naupliar survival during low food conditions.  Zooplankton samples will be processed to enumerate nauplii to species and to determine physiological condition of both nauplii and adult females. Gene expression studies will develop molecular markers for female dormancy and reproductive readiness and for naupliar growth and possible dormancy, which in turn will be used to evaluate field collected individuals.  This will be the first comprehensive study to combine molecular and traditional tools to connect diapausing adults, naupliar production, and the resulting spring population of copepodites."

Many glaciers in Alaska are covered by a layer of rocks and sediment, but there are very few direct measurements of how these debris-covered glaciers decay and affect glacier decline. The debris cover is expected to suppress glacier melting, but studies in the Himalayas have shown that many heavily debris-covered glacier tongues thin and decay just as fast as similar debris-free glaciers. The underlying mechanisms for this more rapid than expected glacier change are not well understood. Very limited observations exist in Alaska, where many glaciers are heavily debris-covered. A better understanding of these glaciers is necessary to develop better models predicting how they will melt and affect landscapes in the future.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to investigate the role of debris cover in modulating glacier surface and glacier mass change on the declining Kennicott Glacier in Alaska. The researchers will characterize the debris cover and observe the pattern and rate of dynamic change of the debris-covered lower reaches of Kennicott Glacier using field observations and remote sensing, to quantify the effect of debris cover on the annual mass change of the entire glacier. They will collect field data including meteorological and mass balance observations to constrain modeling on both detailed and larger spatial scales. The goal is to develop a model that can parameterize both melt suppression under thick debris and melt enhancement across ice cliffs, making it suitable for application on a regional scale. The project will provide training for several students, and field study examples for an international class of glaciology graduate students attending a successful summer school at this site.

They have been dubbed ""blue carbon ecosystems"" due to their disproportionately large role in the global capture and storage of carbon (C). The worldwide decline of these coastal vegetated habitats is particularly troubling because C-rich ecosystems provide critical services to humans, such as nutrient cycling and sequestering of carbon, reduce current and wave stress, and supply habitat for fishes, birds and invertebrate species, many of them commercially important. Recent evidence suggests that the top trophic level in these communities, known as apex predators, can play a critical role in preserving vegetated coastal habitats. Apex predators, such as sea otters, can facilitate top-down control in these ecosystems by consuming herbivores such as crabs and fish that are dominant grazers of coastal vegetation. Thus apex predators may indirectly conserve blue carbon stocks by reducing the number of herbivores through predation. This project will use the recolonization of sea otters in Southeast Alaska as a natural experiment to understand the trophic relationships and indirect effects of apex predators on seagrass ecosystems and carbon storage. This research can inform societal decisions on how to manage these ecologically important seagrass communities as the apex predator range expands and sea otter hunting becomes more pervasive. Researchers will engage with Alaska Native villages on Prince of Wales Island in Southeast Alaska by training local field assistants and sharing results through regular meetings with various stakeholders in these communities that live with sea otters. This engagement will provide an avenue of communication for researchers and users of marine resources to understand the multifaceted role of sea otters in their ecosystem.<br/><br/>The ecological theory that top predators can drive ecosystem structure was developed in response to the question of why the world is green. In short, predators control herbivores, thus regulating the abundance of their plant prey. Through this trophic cascade, predators can play a critical role in maintaining carbon stocks stored by plants. Yet this view is limited to direct effects in the trophic hierarchy and does not consider the indirect role of higher order predators. The trophic linkages between apex predators and intermediate predators, such as crabs and fish that eat grazers, are much less studied. In Southeast Alaska, eelgrass (Zostera marina) is the dominant form of soft sediment nearshore aquatic vegetation and covers nearly 16,000 km of shoreline, which is 1.25 times greater than the entire shoreline of California, Oregon, and Washington combined. The researchers will use the geographical expansion of sea otters (Enhydra lutris) in Southeast Alaska, a region larger than the state of Maine, to investigate the role of apex predators on eelgrass community structure and carbon sequestration at a large temporal and spatial scale. Sea otters were historically distributed throughout the North Pacific and exterminated from northern California to Prince William Sound during the 19th century fur trade. The reintroduction and geographical expansion of sea otters in Southeast Alaska over the past 50 years is a natural experiment that researchers can use to better understand the role of apex predators in structuring marine ecosystems, because sea otter duration and density vary over space, allowing comparison of seagrass food webs along this sea otter gradient. Researchers will rigorously test for a trophic cascade linking apex predators and marine vegetation using this natural experiment combined with manipulative experiments that include alternative hypotheses of what is limiting seagrass and then quantify the role of this seagrass in C sequestration."

Recent reintroduction of some species allows for an examination of their role in the ecosystem, potential for conflict with humans, and possible strategies for future coexistence of humans and predators. This project will use sea otters in Southeast Alaska as a model system, combining ecology, economics, and Alaskan Native traditional knowledge to learn more about the role of marine predators in coastal sustainability. Between the mid-1700s and 1900, sea otters were hunted to extinction in Southeast Alaska for their highly valuable fur. In the 1960s, these animals were reintroduced in the region, and their population has grown from roughly 400 to more than 25,000 individuals. The recovery of sea otters in Southeast Alaska provides an opportunity to understand their ecological role in coastal ecosystems, while simultaneously evaluating their interactions with people who depend on coastal resources for their livelihood. Because otters eat shellfish, fishermen and people who harvest shellfish have growing concerns that the increase in sea otters is affecting their livelihood and food resources. At the same time, hunting pressure on sea otters has intensified from coastal Alaskan Natives who can legally harvest sea otters for their fur. The project will involve collaboration with Alaska Native communities and elders. In addition, it will support a team of scientists that includes undergraduate researchers, graduate students, two postdoctoral scholars, and two junior faculty members. One of the graduate students is from a group underrepresented in science, and the investigators plan to build on their track record of recruiting and retaining students from programs for Alaskan Natives. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to document the role of apex predators and environmental drivers on changes in nearshore marine resources, ecosystems, and humans using an interdisciplinary approach that integrates ecological studies, traditional knowledge interviews, and ecosystem services quantification and valuation. This research examines changes in the marine environment over a period of time in which sea otters were extinct and then recolonized. The absence and then expansion of sea otters into different areas over time allows for a space-for-time substitution in which the longer-term effects of sea otters can be seen in areas occupied longer. Analyses of historical data provide an opportunity to describe changes in kelp distribution and abundance and subsistence harvests over the last 30-100 years. Quantification and valuation of ecosystem services from sea otters, including seagrass, kelp, and fish, will provide information on the potential benefits of sea otter recolonization. The integration of ecological, anthropological and economic approaches will lead to a better understanding of the reciprocal feedbacks between humans, apex predators and environmental drivers. Collaborations with Alaska Native communities throughout the project include consultation with community members and tribal elders about project goals and results, with the ultimate goal of informing resource management to improve the sustainability of rural coastal communities and nearshore ecosystems."

Alaska has roughly fifty-four historically active volcanoes with multiple explosive eruptions per year that threaten local populations, infrastructure, and air traffic. For example, the 1989-1990 eruption of Redoubt volcano caused failure of all four engines of a commercial jet, resulting in more than two vertical miles of airplane free-fall. Fortunately in that instance the aircraft made a safe landing, but accurate forecasting of volcanic eruptions remains challenging many years later. Accurate volcanic eruption forecasting is hampered by the complex and dynamic nature of volcanoes. Recent studies, however, have shown that combining multidisciplinary observations of past unrest can yield accurate forecasts of eruptions from well-monitored volcanoes. In this project the re-analysis and combination of multidisciplinary observations of past volcanic unrest for eight Alaska volcanoes will help to develop a suite of eruption forecast models. These models will be provided to the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) for operational use to improve AVO's eruption forecasting capabilities and mitigate eruption hazards. Additionally, by developing and sharing education modules and courses with teachers from communities near active volcanoes, the populations most directly impacted by volcanic eruptions will be better prepared.<br/><br/>This project will capitalize on the wealth of AVO data, the multidisciplinary expertise of volcano observatory scientists, and the analytical power provided by a team of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and researchers. Our target Alaska volcanoes encompass a range of eruptive behaviors and signs of unrest. Through data reanalysis and multidisciplinary synthesis we will advance our understanding of these dynamic systems and identify commonalities in unrest signatures. Our project will build valuable eruption models for each target volcano, including one complex physics-based model and eight multicomponent ensemble models. These models will be used as input parameters into a probabilistic eruption forecasting framework that will incorporate geologically-derived eruption histories, geophysical and geochemical monitoring data, and expert elicitation to forecast the possible eruption outcomes and threats. This project will advance our understanding of the fundamental processes that lead to volcanic unrest or eruption and improve our capabilities to forecast eruptions and mitigate associated hazards.

The 2006 eruption of Augustine Volcano, Alaska represents an excellent target for experimental petrology studies to constrain magma storage and ascent dynamics, within a framework of robust geodetic and seismic observations of precursory and syn-eruptive activity and eruptive timescales. Details about the 2006 eruption activity and its deposits will be augmented by experimental studies to develop a petrology- and geochemistry-based model for storage of a largely crystalline, high-silica andesite ""mush"" body at 4-6 km depth beneath the volcano. Basaltic replenishment and limited hybridization (i.e., magma mixing) produced a low-silica andesite magma, and re-mobilization of the ""mush"" apparently triggered the eruption. The early explosive phase of the eruption mainly involved the low-silica andesite, which shows petrologic evidence for stalling or storage at ~25 MPa prior to the onset of the eruption. Starting in mid-November, 2005, geodetic data show evidence for dike injection into the shallow crust beneath Augustine, with the eruption ensuing in mid-January. This timescale is also constrained to first order by the widths of amphibole reaction rims found in the low-silica andesite, indicating that ascent to depths shallower than amphibole stability in that magma coincided with the onset of the dike injection. The proposed project would provide experimental constraints on magma storage and ascent rates for the low and high-silica andesite end member magmas: 1. Phase equilibria constraints on magma storage conditions of the high-silica andesite. 2. Continuous rate decompression experiments to constrain plagioclase crystallization kinetics in the low-silica andesite, to decipher the timing of early dike injection leading to the onset of the eruption. 3. Experimentally constrain amphibole breakdown reaction rates, to estimate both magma ascent rates and heating timescales related to magma mixing and hybridization. These tasks will be combined to formulate a model that links the experimental with the geophysical observations, and ultimately to enhance volcano monitoring using precursor geophysical indicators.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project support the research activities of one PhD student (Sarah Henton), Ms. Henton's experience with the Montserrat Volcano Observatory and Soufriere Hills Volcano will be beneficial to the project. The project will also support and enhance the research of three females in the geosciences. Through the connections of the PI and collaborator with the Alaska Volcano Observatory, the results will be disseminated to the public living near Augustine, in the Kenai Peninsula. The results will also be used to cross-link with geophysical data from monitoring activities in 2006, to decipher the source mechanisms of geodetic and seismic signals related to specific phases of the eruption.<br/>"

This research will systematically examine children's behavioral and emotional reactions to nature over a five-year period. The project will examine how family, culture, and geographical locations shape the manner in which children form their identity in nature.  The project will enhance understanding of how children learn to regulate their emotions in nature,  and  it will expand knowledge about the role education plays in shaping how children develop empathy and care for living and non-living aspects of their natural environments. The project will highlight the voices and perspectives of young Alaska Native and non-Native children living in Alaska, thereby, broadening participation in socio-ecological science in Polar Regions. The approaches used in this project offer a framework for participatory and naturalistic developmental research involving young children. Videos of the nature tours will be transformed into video lessons that will be shared with the public as a means of illustrating the role of culture in Alaska Native children's learning about, and interactions with, the environment.<br/><br/><br/>This project will enhance understanding of children's Environmental Identity Development by examining the following research questions: What informs Alaskan children's emotions and behaviors during outdoor wilderness experiences? How do children's experiences in the Alaska wilderness affect development over time? Research will occur in rural and non-rural Alaska during the spring and autumn seasons. The study will include children from a small isolated Alaskan village where the majority of families are of Alaska Native descent, and where access to consumer goods is limited. The study will also examine the experiences of non-Native children growing up in an Alaskan city. Because consumer goods are readily available in the city, these children may or may not learn hunting and gathering skills. This study will use a family survey to understand the different types of experiences that rural and non-rural Alaskan children have in the wilderness.  Children's drawings and descriptions of their drawings will be collected to learn about their favorite outdoor activities. Additionally, the study will use child-led nature tours. The tours will involve wearable cameras in order to examine children's experiences participating in outdoor activities with family members as well as their wilderness explorations with classmates. Data will be collected from rural and non-rural children at 4-5 years of age and again when they are 7-8 years old. In this way, the researcher will assess how children's emotional and behavioral interactions with nature develop through family and educational experiences over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These impacts are made worse with recent declines in the duration and extent of sea ice. This project will combine mapping of real-time storm-related coastal processes and analysis of sediment archives to provide insight into current and past storm surges in western Alaska, while at the same time increasing research capacity in the Arctic. The scientific research will be tightly integrated with a field- and lab-based education plan focused on building coastal science literacy in Alaska, including development of a college course combining online modules and field-based activities to measure coastal change and expansion of an internship program to train and mentor undergraduate and graduate students. The investigator will also hold community workshops that engage stakeholders and citizen-scientists through a combination of coastal science education, hands-on training, and discussion sessions to document local environmental knowledge regarding past storm impacts.<br/><br/>This project will address the paucity of information regarding contemporary, historical, and paleo storm impacts in the Circumpolar North, while simultaneously building coastal education and training opportunities for Alaska Native communities. To understand past and current coastal storm dynamics in western Alaska, the investigator will instrument four sites to measure geomorphic, atmospheric, and hydrographic conditions during storm and non-storm periods. The field sites will span a distance of over 1000 km and include: Goodnews Bay in southwest Alaska; St. Paul Island along the shelf break in the southern Bering Sea; Safety Sound, next to the City of Nome; and Cape Espenberg, a barrier beach system along the eastern Chukchi coast. Real-time measurements and local citizen-scientist observations from these sites, combined with remotely sensed sea ice data, will enhance understanding of coastal storm impacts and determine the role of sea ice in dampening local and regional storm signals. The investigator will combine data from storm observation sites and sediment coring to develop a paleo-proxy record of storm surge and other environmental changes during the last 2000 years.

The fault is an important source of hazard - it caused a magnitude 7.9 earthquake in 2002 - but only a handful of geophysical studies have examined its structure. We know very little about how the fault is shaped and behaves within the Earth's crust, and we do not know how the rocks change along the length of the fault. We use new 3D imaging techniques to see the structure of the fault 2-50 kilometers below the surface, which help us to determine the geologic history of Alaska. To add further detail to our imaging, we are placing hundreds of coffee-can sized seismometers in two separate locations to measure the shaking from earthquakes both locally and from across the planet. This allows much more accurate estimates of earthquake hazards for the region's residents and millions of annual visitors. On a larger scale, it shows us how faults work at the edges of continents, and whether this fault forms the true edge of the North American geologic plate. Our use of inexpensive, portable instruments and our techniques to decode specific earthquake wave types are likely to change the way people study fault zones around the world in the future. <br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary:  We are imaging the Denali fault at regional scale using joint tomographic inversion of body and surface waves, and to locally image the damage zone of the 2002 magnitude 7.9 Denali earthquake. This work is motivated by several unanswered questions specifically about the Denali fault as well as general fault properties. Does the fault have a signature in the Moho or upper mantle? Are there persistent contrasts in across-fault velocity in the crust? What is the relative tectonic importance of the different fault strands? Are there unique damage zone patterns that result from supershear ruptures? Where are the preferred nucleation sites for large earthquakes, and what are the patterns of shaking that can be expected? <br/><br/>To date, only a handful of geophysical studies have examined the Denali fault in isolated sections as part of regional-scale linear transects across central Alaska. Multiple tomographic studies have successfully imaged the structure of the subduction zone and underlying Yakutat plate beneath the region, but they have not achieved sufficient horizontal resolution to image the crustal and upper mantle structure of the Denali fault. There is little constraint on the fault zone structure at depth and the along-strike variation of deformation patterns. To resolve the regional-scale structure of the Denali fault, we are tomographically imaging the fault from the surface to 70km depth using newly-developed joint inversion techniques combining ambient noise Rayleigh wave phase velocities and body wave double-difference measurements which achieve kilometer-scale resolution in both Vp and Vs. In the process, we are also building improved catalogs of arrival times for P, S, and fault zone head waves. <br/><br/>At the local scale, no seismological study has been conducted to examine the fault damage zone and principal slip surface structure. At other major strike-slip faults, linear or two-dimensional arrays of seismometers with spacing less than 100m have successfully detected fault zone head waves that propagate along (semi-)vertical interfaces with contrasting velocities and fault zone trapped waves confined inside fault-related low-velocity zones consisting of damaged rocks. These two seismic phases, unique to fault zones, can be exploited to provide constraint on fault structure relevant to the mechanics of earthquake rupture. Leveraging the recent development of low-cost highly-portable three-component seismometers, we are deploying hundreds of instruments in dense fault-straddling arrays for one month each at two locations along the Denali fault. The density and richness of the first dataset, which we've already recorded, are unique not just to the Denali fault zone, but to all major strike-slip faults worldwide. Our preliminary analysis, including trapped wave detection and high-frequency ambient noise cross-correlation, contains critical information about the damage zone structure in a section of the fault that recently slipped in a supershear rupture. These data demonstrate the feasibility of further analysis including ambient noise tomography, trapped wave normal modes, and fault zone head wave detection."

This project explores how Indigenous peoples? and the knowledge they hold contribute to fisheries science and management and how this contribution is critical to better understand sustainability, climate change, and access to fisheries, especially in light of the rapid changes ongoing in the Arctic. Addressing these challenges in a holistic way will not only benefit Indigenous peoples, but all global citizens, animals, and ecosystems.  <br/><br/>The project team builds upon years of pilot research, soliciting guidance and creating relationships to ensure a rigorous and diverse approach to the project. The specific objectives of this project are: 1) to study and document Indigenous values, knowledge, and governance of salmon in regions across Alaska and the adaptation of these systems over time; 2) to assess and analyze current salmon science and management systems; and 3) to better understand ways to incorporate Indigenous peoples, values, knowledge, management, and governance mechanisms into current systems. The project adopts Indigenous research frameworks and methodologies that support cultural knowledge and strengthen research relationships. Driven by Indigenous methodologies, dialogues and multi-generational interviews co-led by Indigenous students in their home communities are the building block methods of the project.

These processes include bio-physical interactions, socio-economic dynamics, the role of social institutions and organizations in shaping human adaptation. Resilience in these systems is the amount of disturbance to individual or multiple components that can be accommodated without change to alternative domains. The overarching goal of this project is to improve understanding of the relative resilience and adaptability of regional Human-Rangifer Systems to forces of global change, and to derive generalized propositions about their functional properties as critical aspects of the Arctic System. This study of resilience goes beyond the regional analyses of Human-Rangifer Systems considered in past studies, to address the heterogeneity present in the drivers and responses found across the circumpolar North. This circum-arctic synthesis undertakes a comparative retrospective analysis of six regional case studies in North America and Russia. The project develops a conceptual framework for measuring and assessing resilience in three components of the Human-Rangifer System: ecological processes, socio-economic processes, and institutional processes. In addition, simple synthesis models will be developed and simulated to examine resilience in each subcomponent process interactions, as well as in the coupled social-ecological system. This project is the first to provide a comprehensive synthesis of heterogeneity and resilience of Human-Rangifer Systems, and the first such project to predict means of accommodating changes in drivers and enhancing resilience of Human-Rangifer systems in the circumpolar North.<br/><br/>"

These summaries suggest that in the future, rising temperatures will be accompanied by increased precipitation, mostly as rain: 20% more over the Arctic as a whole and up to 30% more in coastal areas during the winter and autumn. These climate changes will have important impacts on Arctic Systems. Of direct interest to this research is the likelihood that warming will promote permafrost degradation and thaw. Formerly frozen soils may be further destabilized by increased precipitation, leading to hillslope thermokarst failures. Recent work has documented that thermokarst failures are abundant and appear to have become more numerous around Toolik Lake on the eastern North Slope and in the western Noatak River basin in Alaska. A widespread and long-term increase in the incidence of thermokarst failures may have important impacts on the structure and function of arctic headwater landscapes. This research will use a systems approach to address hypotheses about how thermokarst failures influence the structure and function of the arctic landscape. It will focus on the composition of vegetation, the distribution and processing of soil nutrients, and exports of sediments and nutrients to stream and lake ecosystems. Results obtained at this hillslope scale will be linked to patterns observed at the landscape scale to test hypotheses about the spatial distribution of thermokarst failures in the arctic foothills. It is important to understand these interactions because perhaps the greatest potential impacts of changing land surface processes and formation of thermokarst failures are feedbacks to the climate system through energy, albedo, water, and trace gas exchange.<br/><br/>This research is designed to quantify linkages among climatology, hillslope hydrology, geomorphology, geocryology, community ecology of vegetation, soil nutrient dynamics, microbial ecology, trace gas dynamics, and aquatic ecology. It will employ a combination of field experimentation, remote sensing, and simulation modeling as a means to quantify these relationships.<br/>"

Expanding upon ethnographic research conducted in rural fishing communities in the Gulf of Alaska, this project explores the social and cultural shifts linked to the privatization of fishing rights in the diverse fishing community of Kodiak, Alaska. This study has three primary objectives: 1) to understand how the privatization of fishing rights has been experienced across diverse human groups that participate in fishery systems, 2) to explore the relative importance and magnitude of the impacts of fisheries privatization compared with other ecological, economic, and technological drivers of change, and 3) to assess the relationship between the social and cultural shifts linked to fishery privatization and individual and community well-being.<br/><br/>This ethnographic study, employing mixed methods of interviews, surveys, participant observation and archival research, will provide rich qualitative and systematic quantitative data to assess how regulatory and related changes affect the social and cultural dimensions of fishery systems and fishing communities. The research framework joins scholarship in political ecology, social-ecological systems, and the anthropology of fishing communities to provide key analytical insights into the relationship between the enclosure of resources and changing nature-society relationships. The research findings will have broad applicability to understanding transitions in fishing communities in the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, and throughout the Circumpolar North. <br/><br/>This study also informs resource policy development. As fishery economists, managers, environmental groups, and popular media sources increasingly advocate for the widespread privatization of marine resources, the social and cultural implications of these transitions need to be explored and documented. The results of this study will have practical application in understanding how to develop new adaptive models of institutional and ecological management that will provide for the resilience of fishing-dependent communities. Shifts to ecosystem-based marine governance call for increased attention to the ways in which individual and community health and well-being and general concerns of social justice are addressed in policy development. The research will provide insights on how the diversity of livelihoods and values can be better accounted for in resource management policy in the arctic, sub-arctic and beyond."

Obtaining access to archived information can be a complex task. For a non-specialist user, it can be difficult to choose the right terms to type into a search box. The better the catalogue description attached to an archived item, the better the chances that a distant user may be able to access it. This project, focused on archived Native American language materials, will create a process for describing and integrating the combined knowledge that layers of annotation represent, so that users can better access those materials. The Native American Languages Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990, enacted into policy the recognition of the unique status and importance of Native American languages. Knowledge of these languages deepens and enriches our understanding of our multicultural history; it is in the national interest to preserve and share this knowledge. Linguistic documentation of Native American languages has been preserved in libraries and archives since colonial times, but modern technology has given archivists new ways to share access to information. The Alaska Native Language Archive (ANLA) handles Native Language materials for all of the twenty-two Alaska Native Languages, as well as serving as a repository for related languages. This project seeks to broaden and improve access to materials held by ANLA by creating a workflow for the curation of important collections to create access for stakeholders in Alaska Native communities as well as in academic and pedagogical circles. Broader impacts also include the training of a graduate student, and the benefits from modernization of the workflow and the protocols for handling new deposits. <br/><br/>ANLA seeks to increase discoverability and reproducibility of data on the region's indigenous languages through professionalization of the archive.  The archive has always depended on collection improvement by knowledgeable users. This used to take the form of annotation to folders of papers, or transcriptions of recordings: a linguist would contribute notes after studying the work of other linguists, and these notes would form a new archived item. In the digital world, the layers of relationships between a recording and its derivatives (like transcriptions or other notes and annotations on the content) require careful organization to maintain. With the rapid advances in information science, adding staff with this expertise and ideally also in linguistics will enhance the discoverability and usability of ANLA's data sets, which represent some of the richest language deposits existing for Alaskan and Arctic languages. This project will develop protocols, workflow, and collection management practices in line with best approaches in archival sciences. As a test case, this project will develop a workflow for collection improvement by focusing on a specific subcollection and developing it to its best access level. To do this, a graduate student will annotate and re-catalogue a large set of texts in a single language (Lower Tanana Dene/Athabascan) to demonstrate how subcollection development can improve access for academic and other stakeholders."

This eroded OC becomes available for biogeochemical cycling and makes a substantial, but poorly known, contribution to marine ecosystems and to CO2 and methane emissions to the atmosphere. While crude estimates of the flux of OC across the eroding coastline have been developed and are known to be affected by ground-ice stability, little is known about the transformation of terrestrial OC as it crosses the land/ocean interface. This team hypothesizes that the wave-washed foreshore zone is critical to the transformation of OC once it is released from storage through physical dispersion, leaching, and oxidation. How the bioavailability of OC is controlled by the age, size and composition of the organic matter, and how these factors relate to geomorphic environments that have influenced past soil development is critical to quantifying OC transformation. How much of this OC becomes bioavailable to marine ecosystems and is released to the atmosphere as it crosses this narrow, transient zone, and how much returns to long-term sequestration in nearshore sediments is critical to understanding carbon budgets of the Arctic Ocean and to assessing feedbacks associated with climate and sea-ice changes. The feedback of greatest concern to coastal processes is the potential for released OC to: alter biogeochemical cycling, increase CO2 and methane emissions, contribute to climate warming, accelerate sea ice retreat, increase fetch and wave energy to exposed coasts; and ultimately further increase erosion rates and OC flux. <br/><br/>Accordingly, this research has four components designed to: (1) characterize the nature and abundance of soil OC and ground ice in relation to geomorphic environments, (2) estimate the total OC flux along the entire coast and develop empirical models to assess the vulnerability of the coast to increased erosion resulting from decreasing summer sea-ice, (3) determine the biogeochemical transformation and bioavailability of OC associated with various dissolved and particulate forms across the land/sea interface through field study and laboratory experimentation; and (4) integrate results to the pan-arctic scale through international collaboration. The study will involve extensive sampling at 50 sites along the entire Alaskan Beaufort Sea coast to develop precise estimates of erosion and OC flux. Intensive sampling at three primary sites along dominant coastline types will be conducted to evaluate the transformation of the eroded OC. Three secondary sites will be added to broaden the monitoring to other coastline types and to involve local communities in assessing coastal changes. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project will provide information critical to understanding the biogeochemical consequences of coastal changes in northern Alaska and can be used to estimate pan-arctic coastal OC and sediment inputs through international collaboration. Results can be used to increase our predictive capabilities in related models that address the carbon cycle and the arctic climate system. Of particular relevance will be the characterization of the bioavailability of long-sequestered OC across a range of soil environments, quantification of ground ice that is essential to assessing terrain stability in northern Alaska under a warming climate; and an improved understanding of the role of coastal erosion to the input of carbon and nutrients to the Arctic Ocean. This project will integrate research, professional and student training, and community involvement at Barrow, Nuiqsut, and Kaktovik, in partnership with local village representatives, the oil industry, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to communicate study results and inform local residents about the coastal processes that are import to marine ecosystems and their subsistence activities. <br/><br/>"

To the east, a large transform fault system, the Denali fault, bounds the edge of this subducting plateau and a major volcanic chain, the Wrangell volcanic belt that has been built up over the last 25 million years, marks this intersection. Such junctions are common in modern convergent margin settings and the resulting volcanic belts record both variations in relative position of the leading front of the slab and translation of the upper plate along strike-slip faults. The processes that generate lavas in these complex settings are poorly understood. Here, this research team aims to decipher the origins of the volcanic rocks in the Wrangell volcanic belt through a comprehensive study of the geology, volcanic rock chemical composition, and geochronology of the belt. The results would provide a new understanding of how volcanic chains develop in such complex tectonic settings. The project also benefits society or advances desired societal outcomes through: (1) planned involvement of students from underrepresented minorities in STEM; (2) increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology through presentations in local communities and development of interpretive materials for the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve; and (3) development of a STEM workforce through training of graduate and undergraduate students and support of early career researchers.<br/><br/>This project examines the geochemical-eruptive evolution of an under-sampled 25 Ma arc-transform magmatic belt, the Wrangell volcanic belt in Alaska. The belt is transected by a major strike-slip fault, the Denali fault system, and located above both the edge and leading front of the Yakutat flat slab. The researchers will collect bedrock, detrital sand/cobbles samples, and sedimentological and structural data from the Wrangell volcanic belt. They will determine major and trace element composition, whole rock Sr, Nd, Pb, and Hf, and zircon Hf-isotope concentrations, and 40Ar/39Ar and U/Pb geochronology on bedrock and detrital samples. Specific objectives of the project are to: (1) determine the temporal-spatial history of magmatism of the Wrangell volcanic belt; and (2) decipher the links between strike-slip faulting, and slab melting on the geochemical evolution of this slab edge volcanic belt. These data will be integrated with geological mapping to provide important new constraints on the development of slab edge magmatism along an arc-transform junction as the leading front of the flat slab progresses inboard and the relationship between strike-slip faults and the geochemistry of magmatic products."

Recently, the investigators of this study have detected a transient event that appears to be the opposite of a slow slip event: a ?locking event? in which a section of a fault that had been creeping stopped for a few years, and then began creeping again. Or perhaps it represented the end of one slow event and the start of another. It appears that the behavior of the downdip end of the seismogenic zone at subduction zones is more dynamic and subject to change than previously thought. The proposed work will follow up on this new discovery, and attempt to explain the cause of these changes. The researchers will determine more precisely what part of the subduction plate interface changed its behavior, or whether some other explanation is required to explain the observations. We will then determine whether these changes were led by, accompanied by, or followed by changes in tectonic tremor or seismicity patterns, and evaluate the stress changes acting on and caused by slip on the subduction megathrust.  Specifically, we will measure the extent and magnitude of velocity changes, by augmenting the PBO data with repeat surveys of campaign GPS sites surveyed from the 1990s to mid-2000s, construct source models to relate the observed changes to changes in the slip distribution on the plate interface, evaluate stress and stressing changes and seismicity rate changes, to evaluate possible causes and effects of the changes, and explore the implications of this discovery for earthquake hazard assessments.<br/><br/>Most of the largest earthquakes (magnitude larger than 8) occur at subduction zones, where one of Earth?s tectonic plates is being thrust beneath another. Earthquakes occur in the shallow part of the interface between the plates, extending from the surface (usually the seafloor) to about 30-40 km (18-25 miles) depth. The hazard from great earthquakes and tsunamis makes it critical to understand better what controls the extent of these earthquake ruptures ? why do they stop at certain depths, and how can we assess earthquake potential before destructive earthquakes occur? The pattern of deformation of the Earth, which can be measured very accurately with high precision GPS measurements, can be used to make such assessments. Between earthquakes, the region landward of the deep-sea trench of the subduction zone contracts, which reflects the storage of energy within the earth to be released in future earthquakes (compression or extension of a spring is a useful analogue).<br/><br/>However, the deformation pattern at some subduction zones changes with time, which suggests that some parts of the plate interface are alternately slipping slowly and sticking together. In the Cook Inlet region of southern Alaska, we have now observed two relatively abrupt changes in the deformation pattern, in late 2004 and early 2010. The simplest explanation for these observations is that a section of the plate interface that had been creeping stopped for a few years, and then began creeping again. This behavior had not been clearly observed anywhere before. It demonstrates that the behavior of the deeper end of the seismogenic zone at subduction zones is more dynamic and subject to change than previously thought. The project will follow up on this new discovery, and attempt to explain the cause of these changes.<br/><br/>Information relevant to earthquake hazards in Alaska will be communicated directly to the Alaska Seismic Safety Commission, in addition to the usual communication to scientists. We will work with the Kachemak Bay Research Reserve in Homer, Alaska, Kenai Fjords and Lake Clark National Parks, and the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy to educate the public and land managers about tectonic motions through public lectures and webinars. There is a growing need for reliable scientific information about vertical crustal motions in particular, due to the need to assess the impacts of sea level rise. The graduate student for this project will be directly involved in these efforts in addition to their research work."

These accretion events lead to net growth of continents and drive much of the subduction-related tectonism.  Terrane collision may also have a profound effect on the size, coupling, and rupture characteristics of large intraplate earthquakes. The present accretion of exotic terranes with the Alaska subduction system represents one of the few examples of this process currently active.  In this region, the collision of a region of thickened crust, the Yakutat terrane, occurs at the largest rupture asperity known, part of the 1964 Mw9.2 Alaska earthquake.  The collision produces mountains along the Alaska coast and perhaps far inland, and may drive westward extrusion of distal parts of Alaska.   Recently, an unusual layer, perhaps thickened crust, has been imaged at the top of the subducting plate beneath central Alaska from 70 to 150 km depth, using receiver functions from the BEAAR PASSCAL experiment.  If continuous with the shallow structure, this would represent the largest deeply-subducted fragment of thickened crust yet observed.  Subduction of such thick crust may help explain the size of the 1964 asperity.  However, the lack of continuity between deep and shallow structures makes it difficult to tell; have these signals imaged the largest piece of thick subducted crust on the planet, or something else? In any case, what is the effect of subducting terranes on mechanics of the thrust zone?<br/><br/>This project images the subducted plate, upper plate, and intervening deformation in the region between the Alaska coastline and BEAAR. Here subduction passes through and past the 1964 rupture zone.  Broadband seismographs image the top of the downgoing plate through and below the thrust zone.  Integration with previous studies providse the longest continuous transect of a subduction zone yet available, over 700 km across strike, following a slab from the trench to coast to where last seen at 150 km depth.  In parallel, a combination of geodesy and seismicity is used to image deformation currently associated with the plate interface, where it ruptured in the planet's second largest known earthquake.  Modeling of deformation, when integrated with the imaging, elucidates the nature of the locked zone, the origin of the largest asperity, and the structural controls on interplate thrust processes.  These results are used to test ideas for the origins of intermediate-depth earthquakes, by sampling at high resolution the transition at the down-dip end of the thrust zone in seismicity, strain, and structure.<br/><br/>The experiment consists of a deployment of 30 broadband seismographs at dense spacing, supplemented by short-period seismographs in places where higher-resolution seismicity would provide most information, and GPS measurements of surface deformation across this zone.  Sparse permanent seismic and geodetic (PBO) stations provide regional control. Many of the seismicity and GPS sites are collocated, so there are cost savings to simultaneously conducting geodetic and seismic field work.  These data, when integrated, will provide a thorough picture of terrane accretion and its impact on the generation of great earthquakes.  <br/><br/><br/>"

Moreover, tourists have no capability to link such research with places they visit. DIG's place-based outreach will be delivered using standard media (broadcast TV, publications) and social media (Web, facebook, twitter, etc.) and mobile devices. DIG demonstration project will join scientists, Alaska Native peoples, tourists, media makers, interpreters and technology experts in inquiry-based learning designed to maximize engagement by the general public.  <br/> <br/>The radically different approach to Arctic-focused science documentary proposed here fosters the close collaboration of the scientist and media maker. Video podcasts (vodcasts) and supporting Web-based materials will be created for three current research projects in Alaska, with a focus on NSF-funded projects.  Such projects include anthropology and cultural/linguistic study, paleontology, climate change research, biology, and other areas.  Delivery and evaluation will emphasize tourists who visit, or are planning to visit, the National Parks of Alaska.  These tourists are accessible to the research team, and they are motivated to seek out information about the places they are visiting.  If successful, our approach to science education and outreach will augment their knowledge about research in Alaska, resulting in a deeper and more informed experience."

The development of a viable model for planning, implementing, and sustaining CBM throughout Alaska and in the Alaskan Arctic will provide the means to ensure a diversity of people become engaged in science and that scientific results are shared broadly with the communities affected by the research. Because of the nature of Alaskans engaged in CBM, the workshop will engage underrepresented minorities in science and technology. It will also increase public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology, and develop partnerships between academia and others. A major potential benefit to the well being of individuals in society will be realized by future contributions of CBM efforts to the detection significant environmental changes that require community or societal responses to mitigate, adapt to, or reverse.  The funding requested would make it possible to offer the workshop free of charge to participants, complete planning, invite and pay travel costs for successful practitioners as speakers, pay facilities costs, and use the results of the workshop to write a CBM Best Practices manual applicable to Alaska and the Arctic."

Since the 2002 Denali earthquake (magnitude 7.9), which initiated along a previously undescribed thrust fault in the eastern Alaska Range, scientists have increasingly focused on how much slip and convergence occurs along this fault system, and where deformation is being accommodated. Mountainous terrain and basins have formed along the Denali fault and the locations and age of formation of these features can be used to constrain the distribution of crustal deformation through time. The eastern Alaska Range, the topographic signature of the eastern Denali Fault, rises dramatically from the tundra (about 200 meters) to sharp glaciated peaks (about 4,000 meters), forming a narrow but high-relief region immediately north of the fault. As the fault continues west, the topography drops significantly, then rises again to form the central Alaska Range, home to Mt. McKinley and Denali National Park. Uplift of the Alaska Range is related to plate tectonic processes associated with subduction and accretion along Alaska's southern margin, but why the uplift is focused along the fault in the eastern Alaska Range is not clear. This research project seeks to understand the thermal history of rocks in the eastern Alaska Range and hence place constraints on regional patterns of exhumation and uplift through time. This will allow evaluation of the relative importance of near-field boundary conditions versus far-field driving forces. The research team is conducting a high-resolution multi-technique thermochronological approach combined with macro-and microstructural work along the eastern Denali Fault. This approach will document variations in exhumation rates during the last 30 million years to understand exhumation patterns in the mountains. Structural studies are focused on the regions with the most extreme exhumation, both in terms of rate and total amount, to understand what controls these patterns. Linking the structural history to exhumation rates will permit the temporal and spatial influence of geodynamic drivers such as changes in Pacific versus North America plate motion, dip of the subducting slab, and the collision of buoyant Yakutat block at the eastern edge of the subduction zone to be evaluated.<br/><br/>This study has relevance to fundamental problems of major strike-slip fault systems, including what causes localized exhumation and how strike-slip deformation is transferred into the lower crust. Results will contribute to earthquake hazard prediction in this region by constraining locations of high neotectonic deformation, variations in Denali fault geometry and identification of reverse faults. A better understanding of contributing factors for seismic behavior along the Denali Fault will benefit seismic hazard maps. The Trans-Alaska oil pipeline and future 26 billion dollar Alaska gas pipeline cross the eastern Alaska Range and Denali fault. The pipeline is designed to withstand strike-slip motion, but if the there is a significant dip-slip component the effects could be disastrous."

During the last decades GOA glaciers have generally thinned and retreated and hence precipitation stored in the glaciers as snow and ice has been released augmenting streamflow and freshwater influx to the Gulf of Alaska. Glaciers draining to the GOA are highly sensitive to climate warming and mass loss rates are expected to increase. It is hypothesized that runoff from glaciers will initially increase by more than 50% as wastage accelerates, but then will reach a turning point upon which runoff will decrease as the glaciers shrink and partly disappear. Hence, the changes in the hydrological cycles due to glacier wastage are substantially larger than expected changes in any other component of the water budget in this region.<br/><br/>The research will quantify these changes in runoff. A glacier runoff model is used to simulate the current magnitude and timing of runoff from glaciers that drain to the Gulf of Alaska and project how glacial runoff along the Gulf of Alaska will change by 2100 in response to future climate scenarios in Alaska downscaled by a high resolution regional climate model. Further, potential changes to the biogeochemical fluxes into freshwater and marine ecosystems associated with the projected changes in glacier runoff are assessed. Results provide regional scale estimates of glacier runoff changes and associated impacts on biogeochemical fluxes for the GOA. A modeling strategy is developed that can be used to evaluate glacier runoff changes and hydrologic ?tipping points? in other heavily glacierized regions. Moreover, the downscaled climate scenarios we develop will be available for other impact studies. Visualization products of the results are made available to the Mendenhall Glacier visitor center, which is visited by approximately 350,000 people each year."

These regime shifts indicate that climate changes are quickly expressed in biological productivity, although the mechanisms that alter ecosystem structure and function are not well documented. Pink salmon are particularly suited to serve as indicators of marine conditions, as they are abundant and have a short, two-year life cycle with non-overlapping generations. <br/><br/>Juvenile pink salmon from Prince William Sound (PWS) hatcheries carry thermal otolith marks that allow estimates of both growth in their early marine phase and of overall cohort survival, thus providing an exceptional opportunity to study the effects of habitat quality. Thus project uses data from four programs that sampled juvenile pink salmon in the northern GOA to estimate feeding intensity, condition, and growth for each hatchery cohort by time and habitat. The occurrence of favorable habitats (i.e. where juvenile pink salmon were feeding well, were in good condition, and exhibited fastest growth) will be identified, allowing description of their characteristics.<br/><br/>Since mortality of juvenile salmon is reduced in larger individuals, feeding, condition and growth is determined in upper size-based quantiles as characteristics of larger, faster-growing individuals may present better indicators of habitat  quality than overall means or medians. This synthesis strategy is a top-down approach, as it is the fish that decide where and when favorable habitats occurred. <br/><br/>Mechanistic understanding of the processes by which climate and oceanographic conditions affect marine ecosystems and salmon production is still lacking. The Optimal<br/>Stability Hypothesis (OSH) suggests that, in the northern GOA, increased water column stability  during summer enhances primary production and zooplankton abundance; leading to enhanced feeding, growth and survival of juvenile salmon. Water column stability, depth distribution of chlorophyll, light availability at depth, zooplankton abundance and salmon response variables (feeding, condition and growth) are examined to determine significant inter-relationships among them, and their bearing on the OSH.<br/><br/>This project will lead to the development of a comprehensive database for pink salmon juveniles, compiled from four projects. A Ph.D. student and a post-doctoral fellow are supported by this work. Scientists at the Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game are providing a data set for the database will benefit from estimates of early marine survival to improve forecasting.  The project maintains a strong interaction with an alliance of stakeholders in the PWS salmon fishery.

Process-level studies include field observations and analyses of the storage components in the hydrological cycle as well as modeling of their role in the hydrological cycle. Field studies include surveys of the main storage components, with literature searches and remote sensing filling in many of the gaps. Field studies on the watershed scale will also be conducted at several small watersheds along North/South transects covering the Middle Yukon, Kuparuk, Upper Yukon, Mackenzie and Lena watersheds where long-term records and on-going measurement programs exist. The WaterWERCs model will be applied to these small sub-watersheds for calibration and validation using contemporary records, and to the entire watersheds for both climate scenarios of the past, present and future driven from our atmospheric modeling. The atmospheric model, PAM, is a state-of-the-art regional climate model that will be tailored for use in a pan-Arctic setting and will be driven by gridded atmospheric re-analyses.

The research will examine how the nature and structure of Inupiat and Yup'ik peoples' aesthetic forms of expression, indigenous language proficiency, and meanings of traditions are manifested in song and dance and shaped by political, economic, and historical events.<br/><br/>The modern Yup'ik and Inupiaq Eskimos of Alaska contrast provocatively as to geographical area, subsistence patterns, language, and culture. For both groups, song and dance have long been vehicles for transmitting history, traditions, and cultural values.  Today, dance is also a way of articulating ethnic identity, interpreting tradition, and representing culture in political discourse. Among the Inupiat of Barrow, Alaska, dance combines cultural aesthetics with environmental knowledge. For them, dance and song from the past express their identity as an ethnic minority. By contrast, the orientation of Yup'ik dance is to the present, not the past.  These comparative situations stimulate several research questions: How are endangered language preservation programs, socio economic situations, and political discourses with the dominant society connected to contemporary Eskimo understandings of tradition?  Whereas some indigenous groups define their identity as emergent from old tradition, while others like the Yup'iks use tradition as a starting point for incorporating new styles evocative of modern culture? <br/> <br/>This study will foster a better understanding of the nature and structure of Eskimo peoples' aesthetic forms of expression, indigenous language retention, their traditionality, and the meanings of tradition wrought by political, economic, and historical events.  I hypothesize that dance performances are the key sphere where people regenerate, reinterpret, and renegotiate their traditions to themselves and to wider audiences.  Comparative research will provide the basis of my analysis of the meanings of dance, song, and tradition, particularly the relationships between expressive cultures, knowledge systems, and perception of the environment. I will focus on how language endangerment relates to the creation of ritual language through traditional dances and their accompanying songs.  By comparing Yup'ik and Inupiaq communities varying as to language maintenance, colonial history, and economic development, this project will contribute to anthropological theory in several ways: 1) role of dance and song as pragmatic, material activities; 2) relationship between song and language endangerment; and 3) tradition defined by indigenous peoples and asymmetrical power relationships. <br/>"

The actual occurrence of a surge, however, is rare because of the long recurrence time which is about 50-100 years and only three glaciers have been recorded to surge repeatedly in this region.  One of these is the Yanert which is known to have last surged in 1942.   This is very different from the glaciers in southeast Alaska where surges are often repeated in less than twenty years.  The exact causes and the behavior of surges are not known, therefore, it is important to take advantage of opportunities for more data collection whenever it arises.  Unfortunately,  the exact year or time of a surge is very difficult to predict and it is impossible to plan for adequate field work in advance. <br/><br/>The Yanert Glacier is located in the central Alaska Range, but little is known about it other than  it is  a surge-type glacier and a surge had been observed in 1942.  The recent surge started in the late winter of 1999/2000, but most of it went unnoticed.  In April 2001, it had restarted again and developed into a major surge .  Because no surges have been observed to last more than two years, the Yanert surge is likely to stop this summer and not resume next winter.  The Principal Investigators will  fly to the terminus of Yanert Glacier and install two time lapse cameras.  One will observe the surge front that is currently about five kilometers from the glacier terminus.  It  will be used to measure the rate of advance of the surge front and to establish the time when the advance stops. A second camera will be placed in front of the glacier. The end of the surge is expected to coincide with a big flood. This camera will record if and when the flood occurs.  The Principal Investigators will also record the position of the surge front, using hand held GPS units.  At the end of the season, they will  fly a profile of the glacier with an airborne altimetry system and retrieve the time lapse cameras.  The profile will be used to estimate the total mass transport of ice that occurred as a result of the surge.<br/><br/>"

A three week reduction in ice duration on lakes in Ontario, Canada since 1969 has caused major limnological and ecological changes. Since the late 1980s/early 1990s, there has been significant environmental change in the ocean, atmosphere, and cryosphere of the Arctic. The recently released third assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2001 indicates that the sensitive and already changing northern high latitude cryosphere faces further change as winter temperatures and precipitation increase at high northern latitudes.  Lake ice in Alaska may be responding to late twentieth century environmental changes and may respond to further climatic perturbations. However, the observational record is neither sufficiently long and continuous, nor covers the appropriate period to allow for a proper assessment of past lake ice variability and the likely magnitude of future change. The objective of this study is to use numerical modeling to simulate the variability of lake ice growth and decay at the present time and during the period of meteorological record in the different climate zones of Alaska, and to understand the factors responsible for that variability in order to predict the response of the ice to future climate change. <br/><br/>Lake ice growth and decay variables include freezing, ice thickness, modes of thickening [congelation ice, snow ice], and break-up.  This is a larger and more comprehensive set of variables than has been considered previously and they integrate the effects of both temperature and precipitation variability.   Successful completion of this study will yield well-validated lake ice growth and decay model that will enable us to identify the key factors responsible for the variability of lake ice growth and decay. This will fill a major gap in the knowledge and understanding of the response of the Arctic and sub-Arctic cryosphere to past climate variability and change, and the prediction of future response. This will benefit physical, chemical, and biological limnologists, and ecological and<br/>water resource managers.

Through strategic investments that build on existing strengths, Alaska EPSCoR creates a research program that integrates physical, biological, and social sciences to address social-ecological sustainability in Alaska within the context of climate change.  The research addresses topics critical to understanding change in the North:  (1) permafrost variability, warming and degradation; (2) changing biodiversity and ecosystem vulnerability; and (3) resilience and well-being of rural communities in conditions of rapid change.  A set of cross-cutting activities, the Integration Core, enables synergy and synthesis of science components.  The research uses complexity theory methodology because of its focus on dynamics in response to perturbations; existing and new data sets; as well as bioinformatics and innovative cyberinfrastructure tools (e.g., agent-based modeling, scenario development) to explore hypotheses about the interaction of physical, biological, and social systems under conditions of rapid change.<br/><br/>The permafrost research uses a new paradigm to test the hypothesis that climate not only directly affects permafrost in the continuous permafrost zone, but also indirectly affects it through interactions with vegetation and fire disturbance in discontinuous zones.  The biological research attempts to document, for the first time, broad patterns of past, present, and potential future bio-geographic shifts in plants and animals across Alaska, with an emphasis on subsistence species.  This research addresses both gradual and abrupt changes mediated by plant-microbial interactions.  The social science component integrates research on food systems, institutions, and social networks to describe how rural indigenous communities respond to climatic and social change.  Since resources sustaining indigenous people are affected by climate change, the research examines the effects of change on human social structure and behavior in terms of rural-urban migrations, social networks, and cultural resistance.  Ultimately the research addresses the impact of rapid environmental and social change on institutions (e.g., state and federal agencies, non-governmental bodies).<br/><br/>The education and outreach efforts of this project focus on generating a new generation of interdisciplinary researchers.  Students (K-12, undergraduate, graduate), post-doctoral associates, and junior faculty receive high-levels of training and mentoring.  Particular emphasis is placed on promoting involvement of Alaska Natives, women, and other minorities underrepresented in science and technology.  Established research clusters work to develop capacity throughout the State's urban and rural campuses.  Outreach efforts target a broad array of stakeholders, all with vested interest in sustainability of Alaska's human and natural resources-from local community members to professionals in private business and state and federal agencies.  These stakeholders, in turn, contribute to efforts that apply research findings to the realms of resource management, politics, and economic development.<br/>"

The event brought attention to this little-studied but major fault, which crosses the trans-Alaska oil pipeline as well as the two main highways in Alaska. Scientists predicted Denali fault earthquakes to have only strike-slip motion, but instead, the 2002 quake started as a thrust (putting one block of rock over another) earthquake and uplifted rocks in the Alaska Range along a previously unknown thrust fault. The unexpected earthquake uplift pattern provided the scientific community additional evidence that thrust faults can siphon lateral motion from the strike-slip Denali fault. If these types of fault interactions persist for millions of years, then determining the amount of thrust faulting next to the Denali fault could help solve a long-lived controversy of how much total displacement has taken place across the Denali fault and explain why the Denali fault is surrounded by large mountains on all sides (forming the Alaska Range). Unraveling the history of thrust faulting and uplift next to the Denali fault will not only help chip away at these intriguing scientific questions but will also inform how significant these faults have been in the past and where the greatest seismic hazards in the Alaska Range are today.<br/><br/>To further understand how faults in the region may be transforming lateral slip from the Denali fault into uplift of the Alaska Range, project researchers will install 7 temporary seismometers in this area to record earthquakes and ground motion. By interpreting these seismic signals, the data can produce 3-dimensional CAT-scan type image of where the faults are in the subsurface and the root of the mountains. Project investigators will also conduct geologic mapping studies, which provide a view of where the faults are at the surface. The geologic maps, combined with 3D images of the rocks at depth, will show where major faults exist at depth and if they cut the earth's entire crust. The project will involve several types of isotopic dating methods to determine the timing and rate of motion on these faults. The age information will provide the fourth dimension to the study, time, and will show which faults have been most active in both the distant and recent past. The ultimate goal of the study is to document how faults that have thrust and strike-slip motion connect into the main Denali fault, and what role they play in uplifting the mountain range. The results are important for updating the seismic hazard potential for the oil pipeline, which survived the strike-slip earthquake without breaking but is not engineered to withstand a large thrust earthquake. This project will provide training for students in field methods and laboratory applications and the overall results will be distributed to the public through outreach talks, spoken word performances, and the creation and installation of a highway wayside interpretative sign.<br/><br/>The modern and deep time constraints on the horizontal offset history of the Denali Fault have been shown to vary east to west over a distance of ~ 200 km, with as much as 360 km of slip ""missing"" in the Cenozoic. The potential that the missing slip has been taken up through crustal shortening and/or strike-slip faulting off the main strand of the fault has not been thoroughly investigated. The eastern Alaska Range has significantly thicker crust in an ancient suture zone region compared to neighboring crustal blocks. Preliminary results indicate that a significant component of this crustal thickening occurred since the Oligocene through a combination of high-angle and low-angle thrust faults. This study will test the hypothesis that crustal shortening and thickening could play a major role in reducing the strike-slip component of the Denali fault. An alternate hypothesis is that strike-slip faulting within the suture zone is the important mechanism for bleeding off the slip. Neither of these hypotheses have been fully investigated by previous researchers in this region. To address this research question, project researchers will collect and combine geologic map data, thermochronology, and seismic imaging to determine the mechanisms, timing, and extent of crustal shortening and thickening, and compare that to previously unrecognized strike-slip faulting in the southern Alaska Range suture zone. Seven broadband seismometers, which will be installed over a region of 80 by 30 km (average spacing 15-20 km), will provide a more detailed view of the crustal thickness and intra-crustal discontinuities than the EarthScope Transportable Array can provide. Low-T thermochronometry will include isotopic systems that record cooling from 400 to 65 degrees C, and when combined with sediment tracking (detrital zircons) and structural studies will provide a 4-d analysis of the region's crustal structure. These new results, integrated with existing thermochronology, geochronology, and seismic data, will yield important geologic constraints on how slip dissipates along long-lived transpressive strike-slip faults.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research program will document the changing role of fire, particularly as affected by human activities, on the Arctic Climate System and its human residents. The research will focus on Alaska and Yukon Territory, a large regional system in which fire is the dominant disturbance mechanism. The proposed research has intellectual merit at several levels: <br/> <br/>1. It will assess the changing role of human activities in the fire regime of the Alaska- Yukon region as this is determined by changes in the effects of people on fire (ignition and suppression) and the effects of fire on people, including economics (e.g., wages, property risk) and ecosystem services (e.g., game, berries, firewood, timber, climate feedbacks). <br/><br/>2. It will evaluate the consequences of climate- and human-induced changes in fire regime on land-surface properties that are important to climate. This is a critical link between research on human dimensions and research on climate feedbacks. <br/><br/>3. It will document the past and plausible future changes in climate feedbacks in the Alaska-Yukon region that result from climate warming and from climate- and human- induced changes in fire regime. It will compare the contribution to atmospheric heating that comes from (a) trace-gas fluxes vs. water/energy exchange and (b) arctic vs. boreal landscapes. This is the first comparison of the role of human activities within and outside the Arctic on the Arctic Climate System. <br/> <br/>This research has broad implications for assessment of both the short- and long-term consequences of the current policy of fire suppression near communities and roads. Fire management in North America is currently struggling with issues related to the wildland-urban interface. This modeling effort is one of the first to explicitly represent suppression in a dynamic landscape fire succession model and will provide a management tool for assessing the consequences of different fire management strategies (i.e., reactive versus preventative) for present and future fire regimes. Because of the importance of fire-fighting wages in the economy of rural communities, this has implications for the sustainability of subsistence activities. It will also assess the overall climate feedbacks caused by human activities outside northern regions (global warming) as compared to effects resulting from human interactions with the fire regime of northern regions. Because fire-induced changes in vegetation may be one of the few large negative feedbacks to high-latitude warming, fire management provides a potential tool to mitigate this warming. The utility of this mitigation strategy depends, however, on the net effects of fire on climate and on human welfare. This study is the first attempt to assess the potential impacts of such a radical regional-scale effort to reduce high-latitude climate warming. This research enhances interdisciplinary research by integrating natural and social sciences and including local residents in our research team. These are important steps in effective inclusion of human-dimensions research in Arctic System Science. <br/>"

This project will focus on place names for two Central Alaska Native languages and their dialects. Both languages are what is known as 'sleeping' languages, when there are no remaining fluent first language speakers. Focusing on extensive collections of audio recordings and language and ethnographic notes, this project will prioritize these materials for transcription and editing. Importantly, the project will also include a focus on place names, not just the names themselves, but also cultural vocabulary and narratives where places are discussed and integrating Geographic Information System (GIS) data in a multilingual format. The interrelated methods employed for dictionary files, texts, cultural vocabulary, and geographic annotation will create a durable archival record. Broader impacts include the accessibility of place names (of importance for communities, geographers, and governmental agencies, among others), outreach to public schools, and materials available to Alaska Native communities for language and cultural revitalization. The products and digital files for the project will be available through the Alaska Native Language Center and the Alaska Native Language Archive.<br/><br/><br/>The project will serve as the capstone of a productive career for the PI, who has spent nearly five decades documenting the Dene languages, especially those of Alaska, including the focus of this work, the Toklat dialect of the Lower Tanana language (the lower Kantishna River & the Toklat River) and the Middle Tanana language (Tanana River between Moose Creek and Goodpaster River). The Dene (formerly Athabaskan) language family is of great significance to linguistics, with members including Navajo, Apache, and numerous Alaska languages. Both Toklat and Middle Tanana have extensive collections of narratives and ethnographic notes recorded between 1964 and 2000, including from well-known storytellers Bessie Barnabus and Eva Moffit, from Salcha and Hester Evan and Celia Peterson, from Toklat & Nenana. Incorporating women's language will further enrich the documentation and historical record. The project will also give special attention to geographic names and place annotations for the middle and lower Tanana Valley Dene language groups. Two dictionary files for Middle Tanana and Lower Tanana that were begun in the 1990s will be expanded to include shared Dene cultural vocabulary items, the common verb themes, and all grammatical morphemes. Place name records for the two languages will be combined in stages with place name inventories for adjacent Dene languages (Ahtna, Tanacross and Koyukon). These expanded materials will clarify the classification of the Dene languages of the lower Tanana Valley and the study of Alaska prehistory. The beta version of this multilingual Dene geodatabase with a digital webmap will foster editorial consistency and mapping accuracy. Eventually (and beyond the scope of this project), this extensible multilingual Alaska Dene place names geodatabase can facilitate the integration of Dene geographic information with scientific databases (in archaeology, ecology, or climatology), or language learning, or for public education, applied toponymy (official naming) and land management by both tribal and government entities."

Understanding this process may help in determining how potential precursory earthquake processes, such as aseismic fault slip, can lead up to earthquake rupture. A number of observations support the hypothesis that slow earthquakes can precede hazardous regular earthquakes, but the transition process from slow to fast rupture has not been observed before. This project shows that the earthquake nucleation process can be observed in the lower crust of central Alaska, and that very low frequency earthquakes (VLFE's), a class of slow earthquakes, can transition directly into regular earthquakes. This research will undertake a thorough search for slow earthquake and earthquake nucleation signals throughout the Minto Flats Fault Zone in central Alaska, where a local dense seismic network is operating, with the ultimate goal of cataloging how these processes are related to regular earthquakes. Cataloging these processes in a single tectonic environment will allow us to model the earthquake nucleation process without needing to extrapolate results from disparate tectonic environments. <br/><br/>This project uses new, high quality observations of earthquake processes resulting from a dense deployment of seismometers in the Minto Flats Fault Zone of central Alaska, with the goal of characterizing slow earthquake occurrence and the relation between slow earthquakes and observed earthquake nucleation signals. Very few observations of VLFE's outside of subduction zone or plate boundary environments have been made, so the discovery of VLFE's on this intraplate fault system will expand our knowledge of where slow earthquakes are possible. VLFE's and nucleation signals identified to date occur at or below the deepest extent of regular seismicity along the fault zone, suggesting that the brittle-ductile transition plays an important role in nucleating earthquakes here. To characterize slow earthquake processes, the researchers employ correlation-based techniques to identify earthquake swarms, low frequency earthquakes, VLFE's, and foreshock sequences. Earthquake nucleation signals in central Alaska to date have been identified by chance, but this project will robustly catalog additional instances of nucleation signals by using correlation-based and seismological processing techniques. This work will quantify these signals in the Minto Flats Fault Zone and investigate their relation to regular earthquakes. In addition, this project will initiate a collaborative relationship between the observational seismology and the earthquake modeling communities, as a graduate student involved with observing nucleation signals will also work with leaders in the modeling community to conduct physics-based numerical modeling of the earthquake nucleation process. The earthquakes studied in this project, though small (at M~4), provide an observational bridge to larger earthquakes, which are hypothesized to have been preceded by slow earthquake processes."

Alaska has roughly fifty-four historically active volcanoes with multiple explosive eruptions per year that threaten local populations, infrastructure, and air traffic. For example, the 1989-1990 eruption of Redoubt volcano caused failure of all four engines of a commercial jet, resulting in more than two vertical miles of airplane free-fall. Fortunately in that instance the aircraft made a safe landing, but accurate forecasting of volcanic eruptions remains challenging many years later. Accurate volcanic eruption forecasting is hampered by the complex and dynamic nature of volcanoes. Recent studies, however, have shown that combining multidisciplinary observations of past unrest can yield accurate forecasts of eruptions from well-monitored volcanoes. In this project the re-analysis and combination of multidisciplinary observations of past volcanic unrest for eight Alaska volcanoes will help to develop a suite of eruption forecast models. These models will be provided to the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) for operational use to improve AVO's eruption forecasting capabilities and mitigate eruption hazards. Additionally, by developing and sharing education modules and courses with teachers from communities near active volcanoes, the populations most directly impacted by volcanic eruptions will be better prepared.<br/><br/>This project will capitalize on the wealth of AVO data, the multidisciplinary expertise of volcano observatory scientists, and the analytical power provided by a team of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and researchers. Our target Alaska volcanoes encompass a range of eruptive behaviors and signs of unrest. Through data reanalysis and multidisciplinary synthesis we will advance our understanding of these dynamic systems and identify commonalities in unrest signatures. Our project will build valuable eruption models for each target volcano, including one complex physics-based model and eight multicomponent ensemble models. These models will be used as input parameters into a probabilistic eruption forecasting framework that will incorporate geologically-derived eruption histories, geophysical and geochemical monitoring data, and expert elicitation to forecast the possible eruption outcomes and threats. This project will advance our understanding of the fundamental processes that lead to volcanic unrest or eruption and improve our capabilities to forecast eruptions and mitigate associated hazards. These results will be applicable to a range of volcanoes worldwide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As this material heats, fluids such as water are released, lubricating faults at shallow depths and fluxing the warm Earth's deeper mantle to make magmas. As a result, subduction zones host the planet's largest earthquakes and most of the violent volcanic eruptions. In North America, the Alaska-Aleutian subduction system is by far the largest such system - Alaska has hosted the largest earthquake in North America, and the planet's largest 20th century eruption. The eastern end of this subduction zone lies directly beneath most of the population of the state so creates a major natural hazard. At the same time this eastern end is geologically complex, making the pathways of fluid difficult to understand and complicating the underlying theories of volcanism. This project aims to significantly advance our understanding of the nature of the mantle in this complex transition, using a revolutionary new data set. Over the last several years a vast amount of high-quality earthquake signals has been collected from new seismometers in Alaska - the entire state has been covered since 2015-16 by the EarthScope Transportable Array that places state-of-the-art instrumentation every 85 km, accompanied by a number of smaller, dense deployments over areas of interest. All these projects ensonify with earthquake signals the interior of the planet in this highly active and complex region. This specific project aims to capitalize on these data to address and test several hypotheses that will help better understand the ways in which large volcanoes form and more generally the variations in temperature of the Earth's mantle. The results will provide a framework for interpreting rocks that come from similar environments in the geologic record. <br/><br/>This project focuses on three generic hypotheses regarding geodynamic process in subduction zones: 1) Variability in fluid release from subducting plates correlates with variability in the degree of melting in the overlying mantle wedge - tested through a variety of seismic proxies. 2) Rock fabric as revealed by seismic anisotropy is controlled by distance from the edge of the slab as expected if three-dimensional flow controls it. 3) The depth at which the mantle wedge transitions from cold forearc to hot subarc is globally constant. Measurements of seismic attenuation at mantle depths provides a proxy for temperature in all of these regions, and local-earthquake shear-wave splitting will complement new teleseismic (SKS) splitting measurements to infer anisotropy. Parallel observations of seismicity and high-frequency phases that interact with the slab surface then allow inferences about the mantle wedge to be compared with slab dehydration. High-frequency wavefield simulations of split shear waves will assess the maximum depth of a supra-slab anisotropic slow layer, a probable signature of slab-mantle coupling depth. At the same time, petrologically-driven models provide a framework for making predictions that test each hypothesis. These hypotheses will be tested via comparison of three distinct corridors within Alaska for which EarthScope and related projects provide unusually good sampling: (a) the Cook Inlet corridor where normal Pacific lithosphere subducts and the arc is robust; (b) the nearly amagmatic Denali corridor where the Yakutat oceanic plateau subducts and generates intermediate-depth earthquakes; and (c) the Wrangell Volcanic Field corridor where slab seismicity is nearly absent but there is very high volume volcanism. These comparisons take advantage of Alaska Transportable Array combined with several dense portable broadband experiments (BEAAR, SALMON, MOOS, WVLF), previous projects conducted by the PIs and which sample each of these corridors. This project addresses EarthScope science objectives and emphasizes interdisciplinary work at the interface between petrology, seismology, and geodynamics. It leverages education and outreach opportunities through the EarthScope National Office, notably those available through the EarthScope website and social media. All project participants - including graduate students supported at two institutions- will work with the EarthScope National Office to maximize scientific outreach of the project. The project will generate improved predictions of amplitudes of seismic waves in south-central Alaska, including within the Anchorage metropolitan region; therefore the project can contribute toward seismic hazard assessments and ground motion prediction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

PI Sine Anahita is proposing to use research methods that although standard in other fields for decades, e.g., anthropology, science and technology studies, social psychology, etc, are in less frequent use among sociologists.  The primary method the PI is proposing is a more qualitative approach to visual analysis of archival films, photographs, and audiovisual recordings of interviews with manual tradesmen.  The PI was inspired to propose this project when she examined the Jasper Wyman, collection at the Alaska State Museum.   Wyman was a photographer and gold prospector who documented gold prospecting along a remote Arctic river basin during the winter of 1898-99.  His photographs visually narrated the work and personal life experiences of men engaged in this labor under extreme Arctic environmental conditions.   This led the PI to consider how the social relationships men form through their labor have changed over the last 125 years.   The PI will examine materials held in public archives and private collections ranging from the 19th century Alaska gold mining period through contemporary photos and interviews of tradesmen.  The project is unique in its analysis of visual data and interviews with Alaskan male tradesmen.    <br/><br/>The PIs choice to examine tradesmen's friendships comes not only from her access to an unprecedented archive of 19th century photographs but also from the fact that employment in the trades in Alaska has been dominated by men.  Although less so today, men still make up 63% of the population on the North Slope of Alaska, where jobs are primarily in the oil field trades.  In addition, at a ratio of 109 men to 100 women, Alaska has the highest gender imbalance in the United States, the second highest is Wyoming at 104.  Although these ratios have changed considerably from the 19th century, it supports the PIs choice to focus on men and how their work relationships are not only affected by social and environmental systems but how they have changed over time.   <br/><br/>Because of the rich visual data from 19th century through contemporary Alaskan times, the researcher is proposing to focus on men's social relationships with other men.   The PI states her case, ""The vast majority of men who have worked in Alaska are engaged in manual trades such as heavy equipment operator in the oil and gas fields, construction of the oil pipeline, prospecting and mining gold, and commercial fishing.""   A key question that guides the research is how does the history of Alaska, its demographic makeup, its geography, its remoteness, and its climate affect tradesmen's social relationships?"

The study will help to answer the questions ?What will these areas look like in 50 -100 years?? and ? Can adaptive management methods address the complex issues related to placement, usage and decommissioning of infrastructure in Northern Alaska??  2) An Arctic Infrastructure Action Group (AI-AG) will bring the CE issues to greater prominence in the international Arctic research community. The AI-AG<br/>will consist of local people who interact with development infrastructure, permafrost scientists, ecologists, hydrologists, engineers, social scientists and educators seeking to develop adaptive management strategies that address the unique issues related to networks of infrastructure in arctic permafrost<br/>environments. Three workshops will bring panarctic participants together, first in a scoping workshop and then to focus specifically on the two most rapidly expanding areas of Arctic infrastructure, the North Slope of Alaska and the Yamal Peninsula, Russia. 3) An education/outreach component  will train students in arctic systems and introduce them to the issues of industrial development and adaptive management approaches during an expedition along the Elliott and Dalton highways in Alaska. The course will include a section at Prudhoe Bay to learn firsthand about the issues with oilfield infrastructure, its impacts and vegetation rehabilitation practices. Students will also visit the village of Nuiqsut to experience village life and discuss CE issues with the local residents."

Thus, these ecosystems are important models for understanding environmental driver and ecosystem response relationships, providing a framework for better predicting how other regions of the global ocean might respond to future environmental changes. Of particular concern are the impacts of rapid marine ecosystem changes to fisheries. Seafood plays a key role in meeting the food security needs of global human populations and is a critical foundation of many regional economies in the United States, particularly for remote states such as Alaska. Between 2014-2016, the eastern sector of the North Pacific Ocean including the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) experienced one of the largest marine heatwaves ever recorded. How the ocean ecology of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) responds to ocean-climate variability and other environmental changes is generally not well understood. The purpose of this study is to advance an understanding of the ocean ecology of salmon by taking advantage of the complete life history record captured by natural markers of water temperature, metabolic activity, and diet based on oxygen and carbon isotope values in the ear bones, or otoliths, of adult sockeye salmon (O. nerka) returning to the Copper River, Alaska. This research is important for advancing the general knowledge of high latitude marine ecosystem response to rapid and unprecedented levels of environmental change, as well as developing the scientific information needed to inform the long-term sustainable management of this key Alaskan salmon system.<br/><br/>Between 2014-2016, the eastern sector of the North Pacific Ocean including the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) experienced one of the largest marine heatwaves ever recorded. Responses by southcentral Alaskan salmon stocks to these anomalous ocean-climate conditions in the GOA, and other density-dependent environmental changes related to the release of significant numbers of hatchery pink salmon to the GOA, have been highly variable and range from record returns by Prince William Sound pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) in 2015 to run failures by these same stocks in 2016, as well as run failures by sockeye salmon (O. nerka) returning to the nearby Copper River system in 2018. Thus, Pacific salmon of the GOA appear to be responding to recent, highly anomalous environmental changes, however, environmental driver and salmon response relationships have not been formalized. The research described here will fill this knowledge gap. The goal of this EPSCoR Fellowship project is to relate otolith and isotope variability during ocean residency of adult sockeye salmon returning to the Copper River, Alaska, over a 15-year period (2004-2018) to a suite of environmental variables that capture signals of ocean-climate and density-dependent factors operating in the North Pacific Ocean, as well as population performance traits of sockeye including adult body size and body condition. Time series analysis will be used to formalize relationships between environmental drivers and responses by Copper River sockeye to advance the general knowledge of high latitude marine ecosystem response to rapid and unprecedented levels of environmental change, as well as the scientific information needed to inform the long-term sustainable management of this key Alaskan salmon system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As envisioned, COSEE Alaska will be a cohesive system of infrastructure, educational tools, cultural context, and scientific interactions used to further an ocean literate populace as well as demonstrate the link between the impacts of coastal climate change and human activity. To achieve this vision, COSEE Alaska will create a network of scientists and educators in Alaska dedicated to developing activities that focus on ocean and coastal ecosystems and communities experiencing the impacts of ocean climate change and to sharing results with the COSEE network, and the nation. These activities will address a suite of five objectives:  [1] Increase collaboration and interaction among ocean scientists, educators, students, and coastal communities in Alaska and the nation with an emphasis on ocean climate change; [2] Provide tools and services to help ocean scientists effectively participate in education and outreach with a focus on ocean climate change and ocean literacy; [3] Enhance teacher capabilities for incorporating ocean climate change information and ""place-based"" knowledge into existing curricula; [4] Increase access to and participation in ocean sciences by underrepresented and underserved populations; and [5] Increase and broaden communication about ocean science and traditional knowledge of ocean climate change to audiences in Alaska and the nation, including the COSEE network. <br/><br/>Through COSEE Alaska, we provide the training, educational opportunities, outreach, and scientific tools to integrate knowledge from both the peoples of coastal Alaska and the scientific communities concerned with ocean climate change. COSEE not only provides to the public the awareness of how climate change is already impacting the U.S. arctic, but also provides back to coastal communities information on the global attempts to study and mitigate the impacts of change. Through its partnerships with other COSEEs and the COSEE Network, its ocean climate change web portal for educators, use of distance learning techniques, and informal education activities for Alaska tourists, COSEE Alaska will broaden its impact far beyond the Alaska population. <br/><br/>"

Using archaeological datasets as a starting point, primary goals are to: 1) assess whether human subsistence choices change in concert with or are independent of local marine ecosystem changes; and 2) evaluate the impact of changes in subsistence on past human health as indicated by the levels of mercury recovered from archaeological faunal samples. The investigators will explore the connections between marine vertebrate exploitation, food web length, ocean production, and mercury bioaccumulation. In the process we will generate new perspectives on humans as agents of change and human response to environmental agents of change.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>This research provides new information on stability and change in the human harvest of marine vertebrates, human subsistence choices, and human response to agents of change over 7000 years. The development of paired ecotoxicologic and stable isotope datasets is an innovative effort to place present day mercury levels and marine ecosystem changes in the context of past natural variability, including possible changes in the length of the marine food web. The research will test models of past marine resource use, and generates proxy historical data ocean productivity and importantly, on human paleodiet, nutrition, and mercury exposures. The project will test methods for measuring methylmercury in bone and will generate direct data on mercury levels in select marine vertebrates. In combination, these new datasets and analyses will enable the investigators to infer conditions under which we might expect to see increases in mercury bioaccumulation in the future.  The project has implications for understanding of the dynamics of human behavior through a consideration of change over time in marine resource use. It also has implications for managing risks and uncertainties associated with the procurement, consumption, and preservation of marine species now and in the future. New expertise and approaches enable an integrated approach to assessing human/environment interaction through the lens of subsistence over the long-term. When combined with future social impact and risk assessment analysis, this temporal framework is essential for understanding and evaluating current conditions in Alaskan communities for whom use of marine resources is important, nutritionally, culturally, and commercially.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>This project is an example of the integration of archaeological, biological, and physical approaches to human science and supports NSF initiatives to examine the complex causes of change, including the impact of global and regional system changes on human decision making, and the interactions between human societies and the environment. A first step towards predicting and modeling future scenarios, and especially human responses to real and perceived health risks resulting from the consumption of marine species, the project also opens frontiers for understanding and managing the marine environment. Data from the project will contribute to ongoing state health initiatives including the Alaska Mercury Maternal Biomonitoring Program. The information generated can also be used to address management and conservations concerns about recent changes in abundance of marine species of economic, cultural and aesthetic significance. The data will be relevant to wildlife managers who need to develop long-term plans to ensure and enhance the viability of the marine ecosystem. The data will be directly comparable to existing data for the North Atlantic as the faunal database is designed for compatibility with similar datasets. This is a step towards generating comparative and comparable results with global relevance. UAF has targeted global change/climate change and Alaskan Native Studies as future centers of excellence. The State of Alaska has targeted contaminants in subsistence foods as a priority research area. This proposal supports all of these initiatives. The project meets UAF strategic plan objectives for<br/>Strengthening cross-campus interdisciplinary research ties, and the proximity of all investigators will facilitate project meetings, enhance the success of the project, and graduate student progress. Results from this research will be incorporated into UAF's Sustainability and Stewardship program (S&SA NSF-03-515) via dissemination of content through student engagement as researchers with agencies and communities, and into UAF's IGERT program through seminar and teaching opportunities.<br/><br/>"

However, this can be complicated because these temperatures are related to both changing meteorology (e.g., air temperature and precipitation) and hydrology (e.g., instream flows and lateral inflows). The ability to predict climate related changes on instream thermal regimes in Arctic streams is limited by the minimal understanding of key processes and the availability of data to quantify heat fluxes. The investigators hypothesize that the dominant heat fluxes within Arctic streams are similar to those in temperate climates but that the relative magnitude of the heat fluxes differ, and that quantification of lateral inflows is key in predicting water temperatures. To test this hypothesis, they would address three research questions regarding 1) the changing importance of key heat fluxes throughout the warm season; 2) the importance of lateral inflows to understanding instream temperature regimes; and 3) the sensitivity of instream temperatures to climate change drivers. To answer the first two questions, they would: quantify heat fluxes using data collection and modeling efforts in two representative arctic river types (alluvial and peat lined, beaded) near Toolik Lake, Alaska; adapt instream temperature models based on prior temperate zone hydrologic research to determine which heat fluxes are necessary to predict the spatial and temporal variability of Arctic instream temperatures; and use differential gauging at the reach and basin scales, along with distributed instream temperatures and other measures, to quantify hillslope-stream connectivity and lateral inflows. Given these results, they would address question 3 by conducting sensitivity analyses of anticipated climatic variability to identify the key hydrologic and meteorological drivers of instream temperature regimes. Ultimately, they would develop an Arctic-specific temperature model that provides predictive capabilities of instream temperatures. In the course of this research, the investigators would develop related curriculum exercises in close collaboration with high school science teachers in both Utah and Alaska, and subsequently make these available nationally. Graduate and undergraduate students would participate in the field and analytical work, and the investigators would share their results with local communities in Alaska who depend on aquatic resources for food."

Very high uplift rates (25-30 mm/yr based on GPS) are reported in the region where the Queen Charlotte-Fairweather fault system ends. High horizontal velocities are associated with this transform system and the area has experienced rapid deglaciation since the Little Ice Age. Numerical isostatic rebound models are being used to generate three-dimensional predictions of deformation, which will be constrained by the extensive data set that has already been acquired. This existing data set is the product of an interdisciplinary effort to determine the timing, magnitude and history of uplift and ice load changes in southeast Alaska. The observations consist of a regional Global Positioning System (GPS) crustal deformation array of 76 sites, sea level rates at 18 tide gauge sites, raised shoreline measurements of total uplift, and onset of uplift at 27 sites. These data characterize the regional pattern of uplift on centennial, decadal, and annual time scales, and portray the current regional pattern of three-dimensional crustal deformation. The research team is: 1) refining current glacial isostatic rebound models using an improved GPS and raised shoreline database; 2) developing numerical rebound models that generate three-dimensional predictions of deformation; 3) using model predictions of three-dimensional deformation to remove the horizontal component of isostatically induced motion from horizontal velocity observations to obtain the tectonic deformation of the region; 4) evaluating the resulting tectonic velocity and strain fields in terms of regional crustal dynamics and processes with specific emphasis on the implications for formation of the Fairweather and St. Elias Ranges, genesis of the Denali fault, and dynamics of the Yakutat Block collision; 5) evaluating seismic potential specifically induced by unloading, as well as effects of unloading on tectonic seismic potential. Using numerical models to quantify glacial isostatic rebound, crustal and mantle viscoelastic properties will be resolved using the vertical deformation signal, and thereby provide a means to separate tectonic and isostatic signals in the horizontal deformation field."

We propose to map and sample these sediments using a variety of analysis techniques, including extensive AMS radiocarbon dating to reveal environmental conditions during the yedoma formation.  We will use the results to reconstruct the paleo-climatic and environmental history of the central Alaska region, a region that during the past 40,000 years has been cold enough to produce and support permafrost, but where now permafrost is thawing.  The expected results will not only tell us about how climate has varied in Alaska during this critical period, but also in the other yedoma regions of the world which include Siberia and Canada.

The quantities of particulate matter being exported out of the sunlit zone, as well as the tapering-off of these fluxes with respect to depth, have a substantial impact on the distribution of carbon and other important elements throughout the oceans and control the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. For these reasons, it is critical that we gain a comprehensive understanding of the magnitude of these elemental fluxes, their variability in space and time, and the processes that control them. The focus of the of this project is to make new, broadly informative discoveries with regard to the function of the ocean's biological carbon pump and the ability to quantify and monitor its strength and efficiency at high spatial and temporal resolutions. In addition, this project will provide the first quantitative and mechanistic study of sinking particle fluxes in the northern Gulf of Alaska by working in conjunction with the ongoing Seward Line Long-term Observational Program. The project will be carried out under the direction of an early career faculty member and provide a training opportunity for a postdoctoral researcher. Results from the study will be shared with the broader public through a variety of print and digital platforms.<br/><br/>The fluxes of carbon out of the euphotic zone and through subsurface waters are poorly quantified and understood, especially relative to other dominant oceanic carbon flows such as the air-sea gas exchange of carbon dioxide or rates of primary production in surface waters. The inability to differentiate between variability in particle concentration and sinking velocities as the drivers of flux variability is a critical gap in our understanding of the biological carbon pump. The Gulf of Alaska is an optimal site for investigating these processes as the cycling of carbon and other elements in waters above continental shelves, such as the Gulf of Alaska, is highly complex due to the dynamic interplay of chemical, physical, biological, and anthropogenic processes. Using a creative application of short-term sediment trap deployments combined with the use of a unique pair of in situ optical instruments, the researchers will aim to accomplish two specific goals: 1) Quantify the average sinking velocities of small particles and their contribution to the total carbon flux from particles of all sizes; and 2) Determine the relative variability in particle abundances and sinking velocities and assess how it translates into variable patterns of particle flux in the northern Gulf of Alaska."

In areas like the Gulf of Alaska, both the rate and angle of convergence of tectonic plates are understood to influence the rate of explosive volcanism. Less well understood is the influence of glaciers and whether climate fluctuations resulting in the ebb and flow of glaciers indirectly impact eruption frequency through increased erosion rates. Gaining a better understanding of how these factors contribute to explosive volcanic frequency can inform us on the nature of particular tectonic subduction zones like the Gulf of Alaska, helping mitigate the impact of potential volcanic hazards on vulnerable populations. The Gulf of Alaska margin is one of the most volcanically active regions in the world, making it a good area for study. However, continuous records of past volcanism in this region are rare due to extensive glaciation and erosion during over the past 2.5 million years. The high-quality deep-sea cores collected during the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 341 to the southern Alaskan margin provide new and rare material to examine volcanism in this region during key tectonic and climatic events. The proposed work seeks to develop a database of volcanic material from these cores to quantify the development and evolution of Gulf of Alaska volcanism during key tectonic and climate events over the past six million years.<br/><br/>Technical Description: <br/>The proposed work will identify and develop a geochemical and geochronological database for tephras from IODP sites U1417 & U1418. A combination of data will be collected to (i) determine tephra sources from the region?s three major volcanic provinces; (ii) reconstruct the late Miocene-to-present evolution of eruptive volcanism along the Gulf of Alaska Margin; (iii) design a marine tephra database for use in terrestrial paleoclimatic studies. Methods will include microscope and magnetic susceptibility identification of tephra, grain-specific major and trace element geochemical fingerprinting, and 40Ar/39Ar radiometric dating of glass, hornblende, biotite, and/or sanidine. Results will be integrated with paleomagnetic, oxygen-18 isotope and microfossil chronostratigraphies of Sites U1417 & U1418, as well as with existing terrestrial Alaskan and Canadian Yukon tephra data. The overall results of this research will provide new constraints on (i) the effect of different tectonic-climate boundary forces on eruptive volcanic frequency, (ii) the genetic relationships between variations in eruption rate and the initiation of the Northern Hemisphere glaciations, and (iii) create a public database of well-dated geochemically fingerprinted marine tephras to provide an improved framework for reconstructing the paleoclimatic history of Alaska and the Yukon."

A new catalog of seismic moment tensors will be constructed by inverting measurements of body waves and surface waves for earthquake depth and radiation pattern.<br/>Active tectonic settings exhibit deformation in the form of earthquakes, geodetic strain rate, erosion, and sedimentation. On longer time scales, these processes create a highly heterogeneous crustal composition. For example, faults may offset two distinct rock types, or a basin may open and accumulate kilometer-thick layers of sediment. On shorter time scales, these settings experience abundant earthquakes in response to stresses within the crust. By using these abundant earthquakes, seismic imaging with accurate numerical methods can reveal the extreme complexity within active tectonic settings. Spectral-element methods have been used to model wave propagation in complex geological settings, such as those with strong topographic variations and sedimentary basins. The accuracy of these wave propagation methods can be embedded in an adjoint inverse problem to improve subsurface images of Earth's crust. The primary product will be a three-dimensional reference model for Alaska. This model will describe the spatial variations in compressional wave speed, shear wave speed, and density in Alaska. The quality of the model will be highest in the crust, and it will provide opportunities for larger-scale tomographic studies of the entire subduction and collisional setting.

Data has been obtained which shows that the  discontinuous permafrost south of the Yukon river in Alaska has  recently warmed by as much as 1.5 C and that some of it is  already thawing. The objective of this research is to develop a  better understanding of the response of discontinuous permafrost  to changes in climate and human activities.  The significance of  permafrost in the context of climatic change studies is that  permafrost can detect and record climatic changes in its thermal  regime. In thawing, it can act as an agent of environmental  changes that influences ecological and human communities and it  can amplify climatic change by feedback effects associated with  the release of carbon stored in the permafrost.    This research includes analyses and interpretations of an  extensive long-term (18 years) data set obtained at more than a  dozen sites representing a wide range of environmental conditions  that span the discontinuous permafrost zone along a north-south  transect of Alaska, measurements of current conditions, and  assessing changes that have occurred and those that are still  occurring. Six sites will be instrumented to measure temperatures  in the air, active layer, and permafrost, moisture contents  (including unfrozen water), thermal parameters, snow cover and  active layer characteristics, and heave. Less detailed  measurements will be made at eight other sites. This research  will also include an investigation of temporal and spatial trends  in the data, the flow of heat and moisture (including several  existing hypotheses), and the application of an analyti cal model  and of two existing numerical models for predicting the thermal  regime and talik development in warm and thawing permafrost. A  sensitivity analysis will be carried out on the effects of  changes in climatic variables and active layer characteristics on  the thermal regime of the discontinuous permafrost."

The traditional view holds that humans first migrated from Siberia to Alaska across the Bering Land Bridge, a land mass that connected Asia to America during glacial episodes of the Ice Age. Beringia, however, has not yet revealed a clear archaeological predecessor to Clovis, the earliest indisputable archaeological culture in North America dating to about 13,000 years ago. Instead Beringian sites contain an altogether different and highly varied set of stone-artifact assemblages. Explaining this archaeological variability is a topic of much debate in Beringian archaeology today. The archaeological differences either resulted from the presence of at least two distinct early Beringian populations or from one population that used site locations differently. Another issue has been tying human settlement in Beringia to dramatically fluctuating climatic conditions that characterized the region at the end of the Ice Age. <br/><br/>With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Kelly Graf and her colleagues will conduct archaeological excavations of the Owl Ridge site, located near Denali National Park, central Alaska. Their work in 2009-2010 will provide evidence needed to explain early Beringian archaeological variability and tie human adaptation to fluctuating climatic conditions. Test excavations at Owl Ridge have already yielded three separate archaeological components that date to terminal Ice Age times, between 13,500 and 8,000 years ago. Full-scale excavations of the Owl Ridge site will be conducted during 2009-2010 to determine the character of each of the site's artifact assemblages, investigate aspects of human technological and settlement change, and consider how these past human behaviors relate to climate and environmental change at the end of the Ice Age. <br/><br/>The results of this study will help to answer some of the most compelling questions in peopling of the Americas studies today. What is the meaning of artifact variability in early Beringia? How did Ice Age environments condition human settlement of Beringia's landscapes? When and how did humans spread from the Bering Land Bridge area to the Americas? The project will provide invaluable learning experiences for both graduate and undergraduate students and further our understanding of the behavioral evolution of humans in the far north, specifically in the context of significant climatic and environmental fluctuation at the end of the Ice Age, 14,000-7,000 years ago. Therefore, the proposed study will lead to greater appreciation of the human experience in harsh arctic environments and the impacts of global climate change on small-scale human societies."

The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) report renewed concerns that enhanced thawing or degradation of permafrost is having a major impact on infrastructures, coastal processes, and Arctic communities. Most remote villages depend on a subsistence lifestyle, and changing climate and permafrost conditions directly affect Native communities. To better understand these changes, the project is drilling boreholes at 50 Alaskan village schools and installing data loggers with temperature sensors that measure hourly air and permafrost temperatures. Teachers at grade levels ranging from elementary to high school are helping their students download and analyze the data in science classes. To support classroom instruction, the project is developing Permafrost/Remote Sensing Classroom Lesson units and a Permafrost/Remote Sensing module to be made widely available on DVD. These activities enable students to collaborate and communicate new ideas, as well as to develop critical thinking skills that transcend the boundaries of the science classroom. Using the Internet, teachers and students can also compare their data with data from other monitoring schools. The scientific information gathered from these stations is also being shared with researchers and the general public via an online permafrost database. The research addresses three of the six International Polar Year themes: The Current State of the Polar Environment, Change in the Polar Environment, and Human Societies in Polar Regions. Through integration of research and education, the project is providing high resolution data on the spatial distribution of the thermal state of permafrost in Alaska, improving the general knowledge of Earth's climatic patterns, bringing science to remote Alaskan villages that tend to have limited exposure to science, and providing an opportunity for younger generations to take part in understanding Earth's climatic and hydrologic systems."

The overriding theme of the project is that along-shelf and cross-shelf mesoscale structures are due to bathymetric control of the currents.  Physical oceanographic characteristics associated with this are the Alaska Coastal Current, its offshore excursions in the Seward Eddy and Seward Counter Eddy, the shelfbreak front, slope eddies and meanders and the deep flow. These features affect the transport and distribution of deep-water zooplankton that are alleged to be an important food source for juvenile salmon and may determine their survival. An undulating, underwater, towed vehicle (SeaSoar) is being used to continuously map salinity, temperature, depth and bio-optical properties. Surface samples of the above, nutrients, and chlorophyll fluorescence are being measured continuously using similar sensors. The PIs are using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) to measure along- and cross-track current velocities to 150 m depth.  The PIs will calibrate the above with on-station samples of salinity, temperature, nutrients and phytoplankton.

The freeze avoiding beetle Cucujus clavipes has a broad latitudinal range, from North Carolina to the Brooks Range in northern Alaska above the Arctic Circle. In the interior of Alaska, this species of beetle is exposed to some of the lowest temperatures in North America and as a result has become freeze avoiding to the extreme. Overwintering Alaska populations of C. clavipes generally supercool (cool below their freezing point without  freezing) to a mean of approximately -40oC, with some individuals supercooling to 58oC, before freezing. However, sometimes, larvae of this beetle species deep supercool and cannot be frozen even when cooled to 150oC. Although during deep supercooling beetle larvae do not freeze, they do turn glassy or vitrify at ~ -75oC.. During vitrification their body water turns solid, but does not crystallize to form ice.. The primary goal of this study is to identify and characterize the physiological adaptations that permit deep supercooling and vitrification. Specifically the PIs  will investigate the roles of antifreeze proteins, glycerol, removal of ice nucleators that limit supercooling, diapause (reduced metabolism), and cryoprotective dehydration and concentration of antifreeze proteins.. In addition, a proteome study will identify additional proteins that may aid in deep supercooling. The broader impacts of this work includes the potential applications for: (1) cryopreservation of biological materials in a non-frozen state, (2) development of more cold tolerant plants for agriculture, and (3) the frozen food industry. Further, the work will include training for a talented high school student and several graduate students. Furthering the understanding of the how adaptations permit survival at such extreme low temperatures has the potential to create enthusiasm and attract more students to careers in biology."

Rural Alaskan schools are populated by over 90% Alaska Native students and are in majority Alaskan Native communities. One of the key issues in these school systems, not just in Alaska but throughout the circumpolar North, is how to retain teachers. Up until now, teacher retention studies focused on the statistical analyses of how many teachers stayed in rural community schools and for how long. And although there has been research on the effects of teacher retention and student achievement, findings showing that student performance is directly connected to teacher retention, no substantive scientific research has been done that explains why retention rates are so low in Alaskan Native communities. Using an explanatory design, the study will triangulate findings by looking at multiple qualitative and quantitative indicators related to teacher retention, comparing them and using qualitative evidence to shed light on the quantitative patterns. Teachers in the region will be surveyed using electronic and interview survey methods. Attempts to contact teachers who left the district within the past 2 years will be made for purposes of semi-structured telephone interviews. Alaskan Native researchers will conduct focus group field interviews of a purposefully selected, weighted, and stratified sample of teachers, school board members, Elders, and Tribal Council members. The goals of the research project are: 1. To identify the degree of school and community integration, which influence teacher retention; 2. To identify school workplace characteristics, including recruitment practices, which influence teacher retention; 3. To identify teacher preparation practices which influence retention; 4. To identify key unknown variables for understanding teacher retention in Arctic Alaska."

Finland in its northern region and the United States in Alaska are well suited for a comparison of Arctic Circle that policies.  Both countries have large amounts of land near and above the Arctic Circle that remain in a relatively undeveloped and natural condition.  Each also has established legislative mechanisms to designate lands under its sovereign control as de jure wilderness. Finland and the United States have indigenous populations in their Arctic regions; northern Finland is the homeland of the Saami, while Inuit and Athabascans inhabit northern Alaska.    Although Finland and the United States share the above traits as Arctic countries, they differ in several respects.  The northern geography of Finland is linked directly to its southern, more populated and urban regions, while Alaska is detached from the contiguous United States.  Finland also has a younger policy history of establishing and managing de jure wilderness.  In 1964 the US Congress passed the Wilderness Act, and in 1980 it approved the Alaska Lands Acts.  The Finnish Parliament passed its Wilderness Act in 1991, establishing 12 areas in its Arctic region as de jure Wilderness.      The study, an initial comparison of circumpolar wilderness policies, seeks to increase understanding in three areas of concern.  First, the study describes the specific types and levels of human uses permitted by government policies in Finland's northern wilderness areas.  Second, it analyzes these human uses in terms of what they suggest about the underlying cultural values held toward nature by Finland.  Third, the study analyzes uses permitted by public policies in Alaska's wilderness areas with Finland's, comparing and contrast ing their cultural approaches to the place of humans in nature."

The research will shed light on what it means not only to be elderly but to be an Elder in Alaska Native communities.  This project has the potential to provide new insights into a highly underrepresented group in research on aging.  For decades our understanding of the experiences of the elderly has been based on majority culture data and models.  As a result, public services to Alaska Native communities for their older residents have been less than optimal.  The research undertaken by CoPI Lewis has the potential to transform the way we think about the aging process cross culturally and through this new understanding affect public policy for elder Alaskan residents."

Fire responses to climatic transients are not straightforward. A major unknown in predicting arctic-system behavior is how climatic change may alter boreal fire regimes, which has potential to overshadow the direct effects of anthropogenic warming on vegetational patterns, energy flux, and biogeochemical cycling. Boreal forests occupy ~80% of the Arctic Ocean watershed and the proportion is expanding as treelines advance in response to climatic warming. Increased occurrence of boreal-forest fires may have pervasive effects on hydrological, biophysical, and biogeochemical processes that exert key controls on the tightly coupled climate system of arctic and boreal regions. In addition, fire-regime shifts and associated vegetational changes will have profound consequences to the animals and northern cultures that make use of both arctic and boreal landscapes. This project confronts our poor understanding of fire responses to climatic change in arcto-boreal Alaska by integrating paleorecords and computer modeling. The centerpiece of the project is its innovative and rigorous approach to understand patterns and mechanisms of climate-firevegetation interactions from the recent geological past through the near future. Charcoal processes of contemporary and recent burns will be monitored to parameterize a new numerical model of charcoal-fire relationships (CharSiM), a tool that greatly enhances the rigor of fire-history reconstruction. The results will be applied to interpret fire histories of the past 6000 years (focusing on the neoglacial transition and oscillations within the Little Ice Age) from sediment-charcoal records. Sediment-charcoal data will be collected with statistical criteria in two study areas that are characterized by contrasting fire regimes and recent climate anomalies. The fire records will be compared with climatic and vegetational reconstructions using state-of-the-art paleoecological and geochemical techniques. An iterative paleodata-modeling approach will be applied to elucidate mechanistic processes of climate-vegetation-fire interactions (e.g., lead-lag relationship, fuel dynamics) using ALFRESCO, a model developed and well tested for studying Alaskan boreal ecosystems. Finally, the improved ALFRESCO will be used to simulate regional fire regimes for the next 100 years based on a suite of forecast climate scenarios. Each of the research elements represents the forefront of current research in the respective areas, and together they promise to substantially advance the understanding of fire-climate-vegetation relations for the past, present, and future.<br/>Broad Impacts: This project should bring new insights into the variability of boreal fire responses to climatic change and to improve the robustness of a key model for predicting future changes in boreal ecosystems. The prognostic simulations of the 21st century fire regimes will be directly relevant to fire management planning and policy. An outstanding minority doctoral student has been an integral part of the team during the pilot study. Students will receive interdisciplinary training and interact with a broad research community to gain an integrative perspective of global change study. In addition, the researchers will engage local residents in fieldwork and give informal lectures to local scientists and communities. The research is enthusiastically endorsed by the leaders of federal fire management units in Alaska who will be involved in the execution of this project and the dissemination of research products. Educational materials will be produced for outreach to the general public and for dissemination through visitor interpretive activities of the Alaska Fire Service, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Park Service.<br/><br/>"

This is the first workshop to be held in the United States that specifically brings together the premier IACUC educational program and the primary organizations involved in the oversight of field research.<br/><br/>The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) support a wide range of research activities involving animals, some of which utilize non- traditional laboratory species in field studies.  These agencies require compliance with PHS Policy on the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, which incorporates extensive science-based guidance addressing the use of traditional species in the laboratory.  However, although field research guidelines have been established by some scientific organizations, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs) and principal investigators continue to have difficulty in the review and continuing review of field research protocols. The management of field research, including the issuance of permits to researchers, is under the oversight of multiple federal (e.g. UFS&WS and NMFS) and state wildlife agencies. These include but are not limited to state wildlife laws, international treaties, and federal laws protecting endangered species and marine mammals. In addition to management and regulatory functions, many of these agencies also conduct field research, often in collaboration with universities. IACUCs at institutions with investigators conducting field research on their own or in collaboration with agency colleagues must ensure compliance with a myriad of rules and also conduct effective oversight of the research as required by their funding agencies.  <br/><br/>The goals of the co-sponsoring agencies and host institution for this workshop include:  <br/><br/>-To provide basic IACUC 101 training for institutions that conduct field research.<br/><br/>-To supplement the basic IACUC 101 training by including mock IACUC scenarios that address field research issues, and including representatives from wildlife agencies as adjunct faculty.<br/><br/>-To bring representatives from institutions that conduct field research together with the Agencies that fund or regulate such research, and Agencies that conduct research on their own or may collaborate with institutions, and provide a unique opportunity for productive interaction and discussion of respective jurisdictions, regulations, and best practices.<br/><br/>-To provide IACUCs, investigators, veterinarians and institutional officials with an enhanced understanding of the various agencies and their respective purviews, and with increased knowledge of how they can more effectively facilitate and appropriately oversee wildlife research at their institutions.<br/><br/>-To create a forum for interagency and institutional open discussion and exploration of common issues concerning the conduct of field research. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merits: A workshop combining the IACUC 101 program with a one-day session addressing IACUC review of field research projects will provide the framework for future educational programs addressing the ethical review of field research. The integrity of science will benefit from enhanced educational offerings addressing animal research protections.  <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Clarification of ethical responsibilities and the process for reviewing field research projects will improve the ability of investigators and independent animal welfare committees to meet regulatory requirements and ensure high quality research while promoting the responsible conduct of research. Moreover, bringing together researchers, funding and regulatory agencies, and representatives of organizations responsible for establishing field research guidelines offers a unique opportunity to discuss common issues and consider a consistent process for the review and continuing review of field based animal research.  <br/>"

Unlike most mountain ranges, the Mackenzies lie far away from the nearest (Pacific-North American) plate boundary where mountain-building stresses originate.    Somehow, stress is being transferred for hundreds of miles across the relatively undeformed Yukon Territory to cause this actively uplifting range to fold up against the ancient and rigid heart of interior North America.     This region is one of the most geophysically unexplored in all of North America, and understanding it is a key to a broader understanding of the whole Alaskan/Canadian tectonic system and how it forms mountains (including the highest in North America) and generates earthquakes.    The Mackenzie Mountain range is the only actively deforming range in of its type in North America today, but its deep interior uplift style has similarities to important past mountain building events that formed the Rocky Mountain Cordillera that runs through much of the North American West, including major provinces of the U.S. Rocky Mountains in Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana.    The project will produce new insight into the past and present mountain-building processes of the region by imaging the deep geological and seismic structure and measuring the ongoing surface deformation, and by interpreting these new data in a full geological context.  To do this, students and faculty from Colorado State University and the University of Alaska?Fairbanks will deploy an array of forty broadband seismometers, and 3 new continuous GPS instruments augmented with campaign surveys at 25 more sites, transecting the wilderness heart of the Mackenzie Mountains for over 1000 km.  This project will be undertaken in partnership with Yukon College, a two-year college, to engage undergraduates in research and fieldwork, and to expose them to new research opportunities and career insights beyond which are common for students in the Yukon and Northwest Territories.    Furthermore, we will, for the first time, be able to emplace seismometers and GPS instruments near the zones of active seismicity, to better locate regions of active faulting.    While this area is sparsely populated, understanding seismic risk here is essential for protecting critical infrastructure such as oil and gas pipelines and mine waste impoundments.<br/><br/>The Mackenzie Mountains  are actively deforming in a zone far inboard from the main plate boundary (Yakutat terrane), while the region between the plate boundary and the mountains is relatively aseismic.  Early uplift of the Mackenzie Mountains suggests that inherited lithosphere-scale terrane boundaries may also play a role in their location. A prevailing hypothesis (Mazzotti and Hyndman, 2002) to explain the anomalous characteristics of the Mackenzie Mountains is that lateral transport in the relatively aseismic zone occurs along a crustal or lithospheric-scale detachment, with little deformation between the Yakutat indentor and the eventual inboard collision with the craton.  Constraining surface strain from GPS in association with seismic tomography and anisotropy studies will enable us to test/refine/refute this hypothesis for intraplate stress transfer and to understand the geometry and nature of interaction between mobile lithosphere and the craton in much more detail than has been previously possible in this remote area. This project will test a number of predictions based on this prevailing model, related to: viscosity, lithosphere-scale structure, evidence for crustal/lithosphere scale detachment, the transition between mobile and cratonic lithosphere, the partitioning of strain between the mobile belt and craton, and the influences and depth extent of major faults (i.e., the Tintina fault), and the associations between high heat flow and volcanism and lithosphere through upper mantle structure.   As an integral part of the project, the research team will partner with Yukon College to incorporate First Nations and other local students in fieldwork, research and outreach, and to contribute to geophysical career and scientific opportunities and broad awareness for students at that institution. We will involve an undergraduate student at University of Alaska Fairbanks with fieldwork and encourage the student to follow this up with undergraduate research using the data. Other institutional broader impacts include links to Canadian, French, and Australian research partners, as well as linking to an ongoing (IRIS (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology) undergraduate intern-associated) seismicity analysis partnership with the United State Geologic Survey, where the intern is also a possible candidate for eventual graduate student engagement in this project, and the education of two graduate students.    Furthermore, the new instrumentation will provide first-order constraints on regions of active faulting and seismic hazard, important for preventing industrial accidents and their associated environmental impacts.    Finally, we will integrate our surface wave research into classroom materials for use at our institutions and to be made publically available as part of an IRIS Education and Public Outreach initiative."

Even though almost routine, these approaches rely on often poorly constrained, empirically determined and variable isotope ratios or ratios to POC. Previously conducted laboratory and field investigations suggest that Th(IV) removal could be controlled through binding by exopolymeric acid polysaccharide (APS) rich biomolecules, potentially produced by both phytoplankton and bacteria. However, researchers at Texas A&M University - Galveston and the University of Alaska Fairbanks Campus believe that Pa(V) present in ocean water must first be reduced to Pa(IV) by organic biomolecules before efficient binding to solid phases can occur, and that the most efficient binding would occur to APS-rich biomolecules produced by phytoplankton species such as diatoms, prymnesiophytes and cyanobacteria.<br/><br/>In this study, the team of scientists at Texas A&M Research Foundation and the University of Alaska Fairbanks Campus will investigate the possible fractionation mechanisms between Pa(IV,V) and Th(IV) in the ocean. It is essential to understand such a mechanism, since the Pa/Th ratio is frequently used as a proxy in oceanographic applications. The proposed interdisciplinary experimental approaches will require instrumental approaches for characterization studies, in combination with controlled laboratory and field experimentation. Laboratory studies consist of uptake experiments to a number of substrates, including purified APS harvested from phytoplankton and bacterial cultures to be used in Th(IV) and Pa(IV,V) binding assessments. The most important analytical task will be to better characterize, both chemically, in terms of molecular composition, and physically, in terms of surface activity, the newly discovered strongly Th(IV) complexing APS of ~13 kDa molecular weight, found in particulate and colloidal material collected from the Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic and Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. The field program in this study will include collection and extraction of diverse types of organic matter for use in laboratory studies, as well as the determination of temporal and spatial variations of radiochemical and biochemical parameters.<br/>"

The approach aims to reconcile the apparently conflicting insights from plutonic studies of magma chamber processes with insights from the study of active volcanic systems. Specific links will be established between comparable processes in plutonic and volcanic systems, for example, understanding the formation and fate of magmatic enclaves. The research will involve field, petrologic and geochemical studies of magmatic complexes where contemporaneous plutonic and volcanic rocks occur: (1) a Silurian complex on Vinalhaven, Maine, and (2) a Miocene complex on Unalaska Island, Alaska.  Analytical work will also be conducted on composite late Holocene volcanic systems, where the pristine character of glasses in enclaves, host lavas, and melt inclusions can be exploited to trace melt histories during magmatic encounters. There are two broader problems upon which this work bears. One is the issue of the triggering of eruptions and subsequent eruptive behavior (explosive vs. effusive) - How does input influence output?  The second is a part of the classic problem of igneous petrogenesis - Are the causes of chemical heterogeneity in large-volume eruption products and in plutons to be sought in in-situ differentiation in the source or host chamber, or in deeper, separate magma sources?<br/>"

Why can subduction-zone basic magmas erupt in such dramatically different styles, as compared to Hawaiian eruptions? Is it because subduction-related magmas contain greater amounts of gas, or are their ascent paths or ascent rates more conducive to explosive eruptions? This study seeks to answer those questions by investigating the influences that gas content, storage, ascent, and degassing have on the eruptive style of basic magma in subduction zones. The investigators' study focuses on three key eruptions of basic magma from the Aleutian volcanic arc: Shishaldin volcano in 1999, Okmok volcano in 1997, and Westdahl volcano in 1991-92. Those eruptions are ideal for this study because they varied greatly in eruptive style (strombolian, fire fountain, and sub-Plinian), including during each eruption. In addition, all three eruptions were monitored with seismic and geodetic measurements, which place important constraints on magma motion and eruptive character. The investigators propose to examine influences on eruptive style in three related tasks. Task 1 will define textural differences (both crystals and vesicles) between the three eruptions and between different phases of the eruptions. Task 2 will define pre-eruptive gas contents and pre-eruptive storage conditions of the three magmas, with a combination of glass inclusion measurements and experimental petrologic work. Task 3 will define the relationship between decompression (ascent) rate and textural differences in the resulting products, through a series of experimental petrologic work. Results from the three tasks, combined with the existing geophysical constraints on the eruptions, will allow the investigation of the gas contents, storage, ascent, degassing, and eruption of basic magma in the Aleutians. Experiments will be performed in the Experimental Petrology Laboratory at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and all products will be analyzed in the Advanced Instrumentation Laboratory at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.<br/>"

The fraction of iron that dissolves in seawater after its atmospheric deposition is thought to be available to phytoplankton, and thus an important parameter not only for the marine biogeochemical cycle of iron, but also for the global carbon cycle.

Many models suggest that magmas either erupt explosively or effuse as lava, depending on the magma's ability to degas efficiently, which is controlled by the melt transferring gas to bubbles.  If bubbles and melt fail fall out of equilibrium, over-pressure develops and fragments the magma.  Despite the central role that gas bubbles play in volcanism, experimental work has only recently begun to address their growth in silicate melts.  This project addresses the dynamics of bubble growth in silicate melts through detailed analysis of the rates of bubble growth and equilibrium between bubbles and melt as a function of pressure drop.  Controlled hydrothermal experiments will be used to impose variable decompression histories on gas-melt systems in order to examine how bubbles grow and at what rates of pressure decrease do bubbles-melt fail to remain in equilibrium.

In addition to sampling of sea-ice state variables, the observation-system design is guided by the concept of sea-ice system services (SISS). By assessing the nature and extent of SISS, an integrated observation network can be built that will lead to prediction of key trends in a changing Arctic in a way that provides maximum benefit for the broadest range of affected interests. The first iteration of this observation program will help to address these major scientific questions: 1) To what extent are changes in the SIZ at the local level throughout the Arctic correlated with large-scale change in summer minimum ice extent?, 2) How does the SIZ respond to amplified ice-albedo feedback in seasonal ice as opposed to the buffering effects of enhanced snow-ice interaction and ice deformation?, 3) How strongly does coastal sea ice impact change in terrestrial environments?, 4) What does the sub-Arctic Okhotsk Sea teach about impending Arctic environmental and socio-economic change? While the focus of this project is on the Western Arctic, which has seen some of the most dramatic sea-ice reductions in past decades, an international team has been assembled from six nations that maximizes synergies and allows these questions to be addressed in a circum-Arctic context along a latitudinal gradient spanning the entire extent of the seasonal ice zone, well into the perennial ice. Observations in the western Arctic sector include shore-based and drift-ice measurements of ice motion, key mass-balance variables and critical snow and ice properties such as albedo, as well as airborne electromagnetic ice thickness measurements. Pan-Arctic data of seasonal ice evolution and ice-type distribution will be extracted from satellite microwave remote-sensing observations. All data will be ingested into an archival and dissemination system that is linked to the Alaska Ocean Observing System and administered by the Geographic Information Network of Alaska.

At every stage of the food system (production, processing, distribution, consumption, and waste) the system touches both social and biophysical components of the ecosystem.  Concerns about the environmental and social effects of the global food system, which is based on intensification and specialization of production and distancing of production and consumption, have lead to calls for production of a greater proportion of food within or close to the community in which it will be consumed.  However, little research has explored the environmental and social outcomes of food system localization.  The goal of this project is to explore the connections between food systems and linked social and ecological systems in the context of food system localization efforts.  The community of Fairbanks, Alaska has been engaged in local food production efforts such as community gardens, small farms, and a farmer's market for many years, making it an ideal site to study the effects of attempts to localize a food system.  This project tests the hypotheses that local food production reduces the distance food travels into a community (""food miles""); localization efforts improve access to and affordability of food within a community; and local food production increases regional biodiversity.  Energy requirements to supply food to the community will be based on calculation of food miles for a selection of local and imported foods.  Analysis of local food accessibility and affordability in Fairbanks will be conducted through the creation of a food asset map using a geographic information system (GIS).  Interviews with local gardeners and farmers will provide information on the total amount of food produced locally and farming and gardening methods.  The effect of increased agricultural lands on biodiversity will be assessed through a survey of bird species diversity and abundance across land-use types (forest, agricultural, and urban).  This interdisciplinary approach will build an integrated picture of the role food system localization might play in community sustainability.<br/><br/>Information collected from this study on the strengths and weaknesses of local food production will be particularly instructive to the many rural Alaskan communities seeking ways to localize and stabilize their food systems. Communities throughout North American will also benefit from the wealth of knowledge, experience, and data available in Fairbanks as they design sustainable food systems.  This project will advance our understanding of the outcomes of environmental decision-making at community and global scales.  Because environmental decisions are often made in a state of uncertainty and complexity, strategies intended to improve one part of a system can have unintended consequences on other system components.  Understanding the links between intent and outcome will help us to better anticipate the outcomes of our environmental decisions as well as help communities build effective, sustainable food systems.  <br/><br/>"

This zonal section contrasts sharply to the high aerosol deposition areas found and sampled during the GEOTRACES North Atlantic Zonal Section in the fall of 2010 and 2011.  As such, this Pacific section represents a unique opportunity to characterize aerosol and rainfall chemistry in a low deposition environment.  Scientists from the University of Alaska and Florida State University plan to collect and characterize aerosol and rainfall samples along this transect, as well as distribute samples to the community.  Bulk and size-fractionated aerosol samples collected on a 24 to 48-hour integrated basis and event-based rain samples will be analyzed for trace elements and isotopes (TEIs) to quantify their atmospheric input.  The TEIs to be analyzed will be aluminum, vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium, lead, and thorium, as well as the major ions sodium, magnesium, potassium, calcium, nitrate, phosphate, chlorine, and fluorine.  Other efforts to be carried out as part of this study include (1) aerosol leaches to determine seawater-soluble and ultrapure-water-soluble TEI fractions: (2) determine the size fractionation and redox speciation of seawater-soluble iron: (3) obtain subsamples of water column samples from other GEOTRACES scientists for the analysis of the TEIs of interest to help interpret the atmospheric deposition data; and (4) collaborate with researchers from other institutions to characterize and constrain estimates of atmospheric deposition. This project will contribute towards the overall goal of the GEOTRACES Program by establishing the range of fractional aerosol solubility and better quantify deposition across the global ocean. <br/><br/>One graduate student from the University of Alaska would be supported and trained as part of this project.  Relying on a cruise blog, email, and project website updates, the scientist from the University of Alaska plans to continue her interactions with students in Alaska, Arizona, and Florida and results from the study would be incorporated into class curricula, as well as disseminated via public outreach and web dissemination."

The main effort under the U.S. component focuses on assessing the role of sulfates  and other continental aerosols in global radiative forcing and is being supported  jointly by the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation.  In  addition, complementary studies involving investigations of a variety of related  chemical and radiative processes will be undertaken by scientists from other federal  agencies and other international partners.  The composite observing system consists of  a wide range of platforms, from ships to aircraft, as well as surface-based and balloon  measuring systems, and satellite data.  The main part of the three year effort will be a  four-month intensive field phase which begins January 1999.    The ultimate goal of this program is to obtain a better understanding of the decadal  and longer time scale climate forcing.  The equatorial Indian Ocean during the  northeast winter monsoon season provides a unique natural laboratory for this  experiment.  The experimental area is probably the only place in the world where an  air mass which has been modified by intense sources of continental aerosols,  anthropogenic trace species, and their reaction products (e.g., sulfates and ozone)  from the northern hemisphere comes into contact with the pristine air of the southern  hemisphere, which has been transported via cross equatorial monsoonal flow, at the  Intertropical Convergence Zone.   The juxtaposition of these two very distinct air  masses will allow a thorough examination of both the direct and indirect effects of the  aerosols on the radiative properties of the atmosphere.    Dr. Shaw's role in INDOEX is to measure the concentration and supersaturation  spect rum of Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) aboard the Indian research vessel  ORV Sagar Kanya in the spring, 1998 INDOEX science cruise.  The purpose is to  test the hypothesis that aerosols transported from the Indian Subcontinent affect the  number distribution and therefore the albedo of clouds in the Indian Ocean."

Machine learning is revolutionizing the way these data are observed. As a merger between statistics and computer science, the techniques of machine learning have been used for decades, but recent improvements in high-performance computing, and research investment from the commercial sector have supercharged the utility of these methods. Environmental scientists have been relatively slow to take up these new methods, in part because the rapid pace of discovery makes it difficult to stay at the cutting edge, but as scientific datasets grow ever larger and more complex, it is becoming increasingly important to make use of machine learning as a way to explore and understand the world. In collaboration with colleagues at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, the PI aims to stimulate progress in oceanography and genomics by bringing cutting edge tools and techniques from the world of machine learning to Alaska. Acquiring these skills in parallel with an early career scientist, and applying them to ongoing research projects in the Arctic, will enable a substantially improved understanding of ongoing changes in the marine ecosystems of Alaska. Passing on this knowledge to students by designing and teaching a new course on Machine Learning in the Environmental Sciences will ensure that future generations of Alaskans have access to the skills they will need to succeed in science and beyond.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The broad goals of this visit are to advance machine learning in biological oceanography through interdisciplinary collaborations and knowledge transfer. The PI aims to leverage extensive expertise at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) to advance research on Arctic marine microbial communities using machine learning methods. The WHOI Autonomous Robotics and Perception Laboratory (WARP) Lab specializes in adaptive sampling, marine robotics, computer vision, autonomous robotic exploration, semantic perception, bayesian nonparametrics, deep learning, surprise detection, and data summarization. Objectives of this project include learning the theory and concepts of machine learning in structured and informal settings, which include several common programming languages and toolkits. Using this base, the PI and a graduate trainee will apply the tools and techniques of machine learning to predict spatiotemporal distributions of Arctic marine microbes, their use and transformations of metals, and advance biological oceanographic sampling techniques.  The PI will accomplish this effort by designing methods for adaptive biological sampling using flow-through systems and ocean profilers. Outcomes of the project will include the development of a new course on Machine Learning in the Environmental Sciences to be taught at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and online via the University of the Arctic. Career development and mentorship of the graduate student will include training in computing fluency in the Software Carpentry program and subsequent training as an instructor. As part of the knowledge exchange with WHOI, the PI will host an Oxford Nanopore minION sequencing workshop in Woods Hole to share this cutting edge technology, and lead cross-cutting discussions on the use of machine learning in advancing this technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Changes in the magnitude and seasonality of Arctic summer vegetation production over the past several decades have been documented. These changes will likely accelerate and have consequences for the entire Arctic terrestrial system, in particular energy and element budgets, and will also feed back to marine and atmospheric systems. This project will characterize the seasonal linkages between the land surface greenness and a suite of land, atmosphere, and ocean characteristics, focusing on the Beringia/Beaufort Sea, where there have been strong positive increases in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over the past 25 years, and the west-central Arctic Eurasia region , where the NDVI trends have been slightly negative. The following questions will be addressed: (1) What are the spatial and temporal variabilities in the seasonality of various arctic system components (sea-ice concentration and thickness, ocean and land surface temperatures, ocean heat fluxes, snow cover, and vegetation as specified by the NDVI? Specifically, how do these vary zonally and meridionally in the circumpolar Arctic? (2) What role do the atmosphere and ocean circulation patterns play in controlling the seasonality of land temperatures and vegetation production? (3) How do changes in the seasonality of these arctic system components affect vegetation growth and carbon sequestration?  Using both satellite and in situ data sets, this project will document the seasonal (daily to monthly timescales) of the tundra and marine climate systems at a regional scale throughout the Arctic. Reanalysis data sets will be employed to describe local circulation characteristics. A pan-arctic ice-ocean model will be used to describe ocean circulation patterns relevant for tundra vegetation, with the application of statistical analyses to investigate mechanisms of ocean-atmosphere-land relationships. A vegetation change model (ArcVeg) will analyze the consequences of land temperature changes for carbon production along climate, disturbance, and soil gradients. This model will be enhanced for seasonality studies, including transition to a daily time step, and will allow the examination of effects of seasonality changes on the carbon accumulated by different functional plant types and into different plant tissue types."

Although the R/V ALPHA                   HELIX has a slight amount of ice strengthening that allows it to                operate near ice, the vessel is not capable of true ice                         operations."

Faunistically, including birds, there is no other region of its type on the planet.  It hosts a diverse New World and old World avifauna, as well as a uniquely Beringian avifauna.  Historically, other museums have been important in documenting the avian diversity of this remarkable region, but in the late twentieth century these activities have been conducted almost exclusively by the University of Alaska Museum (UAM).<br/><br/>In 1997 the UAM bird collection grew by 1,000 specimens, or by 14%.  This growth rate will be sustained or exceeded for the foreseeable future, and probably ranks UAM among the top 10-12 institutions in North America in collections growth.  If one counts objects preserved, rather than individuals, then the growth rate is larger.  The great majority of specimens being added today are prepared as skins, partial skeletons, tissue samples, and stomach contents - five separate pieces for each individual.  The collection is fully computerized, and the cataloguing process involves entering each specimen acquired directly into the computer database.  At present specimen holdings exceed the space available in cases.  The skeleton collection and some of the lesser-used skin material are currently being stored in cardboard boxes on top of cases in the bird range.  Because there is no available collection expansion space in cases, not all of holdings can be placed in taxonomic order.  None of these problems is acceptable for an active systematics collection, and all of them can be alleviated with new cases.  This project will support the purchase of new cases, which are anticipated to satisfy needs for the next 3-5 years.  <br/>"

Effective scientific assistance is needed to help address those problems and opportunities.  Skills and expertise from social science could play a critical role in assisting with such important issues as Native economic advancement, educational attainment, community and individual health, and management of tribal resources and services. The potential value of psychological science to these outcomes especially exists because many past efforts to execute applied projects in Native communities have floundered as much or more due to human factors (such as factional infighting, poor planning, poor leadership, or inadequate skills) as because of financial or technological inadequacies to the projects. Social science has only scratched the surface in investigating the unique dynamics of Native cultures, Native social patterns, and Native psyches. This project will 1) summarize the state of social science knowledge of Native individuals and communities. 2) Develop a social science research agenda.  3) Promote exchanges and development of collaborations among social science researchers who focus on Native issues. 4) Plan a curriculum to teach Native Psychology and create an educational pipeline and an educational structure to develop Native Psychology scientists. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/>"

The benefits are expected to extend beyond basic science to the coordinated monitoring and mitigation of natural hazards, such as those from earthquakes, tsunamis, and explosive volcanic eruptions and the sharing of information relevant to natural resources. An important role of the meeting will be to acquaint students with the broader context of their areas of  fieldwork and to facilitate direct contact with students from other countries. The intent is to stimulate international and interdisciplinary collaborations that will last throughout their careers. The meeting will also serve to inform and stimulate involvement by American geoscientists in their own island arc, the Aleutians. Although there has been rapid growth in hazards-driven monitoring and research there, the academic community of the lower 48 states has yet to take full advantage of the opportunities for basic research that the high level of activity of the Aleutians offers.

NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies, and the next generation of Arctic researchers, and integrates the co-production of knowledge. This award fulfills part of that aim. <br/><br/>The cold and dark wintertime conditions of the Arctic lead to frequent poor air quality episodes linked to local emissions along with temperature inversions that trap pollutants in the areas where people live. Infrastructure planning such as energy generation and industrial activities along with residential choices of heating fuels such as wood, fuel oil or others are critical aspects of this problem. Residents spend most of their time indoors during wintertime, so most exposure to pollutants occurs indoors. From this background, fundamental knowledge gaps were identified in: outdoor/indoor air transport, indoor pollution sources such as leaky heating appliances, and chemical transformation of pollutants under these Arctic conditions. These gaps must be closed to understand the impacts of air pollution on Arctic communities and improve community health. Sustainably Navigating Arctic Pollution -- Through Engaging Communities (SNAP-TEC) focuses on improving understanding of wintertime Arctic outdoor and indoor air pollution. Discussions with community members will assist researchers in identifying local concerns regarding air quality, and in designing appropriate sustainable development frameworks, with the goal of improving air quality for Arctic peoples. <br/><br/>To investigate wintertime Arctic air pollution issues at the intersection of the natural and built environments and social systems, SNAP-TEC uses a convergence approach that starts with a community engagement process to build a research and co-generation of knowledge program that has direct impacts on the community. This project has grown out of organizing efforts under the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Project activity ""Air Pollution in the Arctic: Climate, Environment and Societies"" (PACES) and the Alaskan Layered Pollution and Chemical Analysis (ALPACA) project, which have documented knowledge gaps in this area. (See the ALPACA whitepaper, readily available online.) SNAP-TEC brings together a multi-disciplinary team to investigate this problem, with the center focus being a wintertime field campaign in Fairbanks, Alaska, where the scientific and social issues surrounding poor air quality can serve as a case study to inform practice and policy in similar cities, and villages across the broader Arctic region. The resulting knowledge of pollution sources and chemistry, housing and pollution control technology, and social aspects, can assist New Arctic communities to plan appropriate solutions that work for residents. Local and Indigenous peoples are most likely to be affected by Arctic development, therefore, the community engagement process will include local Fairbanks residents and Alaska Native community members. The project measures indoor and outdoor air quality using state-of-the art instrumentation to advance fundamental understanding of air pollution sources and chemical processes under cold and dark conditions, indoor/outdoor air exchange, and physicochemical changes to pollutants upon warming to indoor conditions, sulfur oxidation chemistry, and toxicity of air pollution. The field program is combined with community meetings, public participation in scientific data collection (a.k.a. citizen science, using inexpensive air-quality sensor monitoring), and a survey to assess public understanding of air quality, trust in science, perceived risk and uncertainty, and support for air quality policies. The SNAP-TEC research team involves a diverse group of natural and social scientists and engineers with extensive student involvement to address the problem. Through the international PACES organization, lessons learned from this investigation will be extended to an international pan-Arctic context through identification of fundamental processes and best practices, informing Arctic development and future studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project goals are to (1) create opportunities for the public to learn about the vital role that snow plays in climate, water resources, and human lives, and (2) produce a better understanding of how culture affects informal Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) learning.  The deliverables include: (a) an outreach program in Alaska that will visit 33 remote native villages, (b) a 2000 square foot museum exhibit on snow produced by the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) and exhibited at two additional museums during the life of the award, and (c) learning research, which will examine how the wide variation of cultural relationships to snow impacts learning during museum exhibits.  Each of these components will be evaluated over the course of the work.  The travelling exhibit is expected to be shown at three museums per year for eight years, with an anticipated cumulative audience of over one million.<br/><br/>The focus on snow will highlight a fascinating yet under-appreciated part of the Earth system. The project aims to educate the public about snow and to produce a more informed and thoughtful public in the face of potential expensive and difficult snow-related societal decisions.  Through informative displays, graphics, models, and other material, the project will engage traditionally under-served communities (at Native/remote villages) in Alaska, where a strong cultural connection to snow exists, as well as communities across the U.S. where the connection to snow can range from strong to weak.  Across this cultural gradient, the project will explore through oral interviews and surveys the public response to various types and designs of informal science learning (ISL) displays, attempting to isolate and control for the effect of cultural vs. individual response to the materials.  Informal learning theory specifies using front-end exploration of individual visitor-content relationships to guide exhibit design.  This project's research goal expands that approach to include the effects of cultural engagement with a topic to develop more general tools to guide and improve the design process.  The project is led by the University of Alaska Fairbanks in collaboration with OMSI (Oregon Museum of Science and Industry), and the Lifelong Learning Group at COSI (Center of Science and Industry), which leads the research, and the Goldstream Group, the evaluators. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.

These efforts are supported in part by Gwich'in language courses at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. However, in spite of a rich history of linguistic documentation of Gwich'in, there is no accessible reference or pedagogical grammar of Gwich'in. In fact, there is no published comprehensive grammatical description for any of the eleven Athabascan languages of Alaska.<br/><br/>With funding from NSF this project will create a pedagogical grammar of the Gwich'in language for use by students and scholars. The grammar will serve as a key component of the developing Gwich'in language curriculum at the Alaska Native Language Center. In addition, the grammar will provide a primary scholarly resource documenting the structure of a typologically unusual language. The grammar will be accompanied by a Curriculum Guide to aid in the teaching of Gwich'in grammar in language classes. This guide may serve as a model that may be adapted for other languages. In addition, interested K-12 language teachers and language learners may find the model beneficial for their own use.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

There are two objectives in this program. The first objective is to develop nanofabrication processes to generate nanodimension phases. The second objective is to understand the role of mechanical stimulation on phase formation and transformation at small scale. The primary experimental approach is to use an atomic force microscope (AFM) to conduct mechanical stimulation. Professor Liang will use several contact and scanning modes to dope elements from an AFM tip to a substrate surface. The doped surfaces will be subsequently heat-treated to form desired phases. The AFM will also be used for surface characterization, along with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscope techniques. How structure-surface properties are impacted by the effects of mechanical energy and heat treatment processes will be studied. The simplicity and flexibility of the mechanical manipulation techniques is a significant advantage for synthesis and characterization of nano-structures. The potential applications in nanomachining, assembly, nanosensors, and development of MEMS and NEMS are extremely exciting. Intellectual merit also lies in developing scientific understanding of a series of new phenomena and non-equilibrium transformations. These include: properties of nanophases, nanoscale phase transformation, and their property-performance relationships with materials. Understanding friction-induced nanophases and phase transformation will open new areas of materials research in surface science and nanostructured materials. <br/><br/>This research is integrated with education activities, including ongoing program development in Materials Science and outreach to Alaskan K-12 and schoolteachers. Both graduate and undergraduate level students will be involved in this research. Students will have an opportunity to explore the most advanced manufacturing technologies.  Expanding such new technologies and bringing them to public attention in the local community is the first step to encouraging small companies in Alaska. Such companies can create more job opportunities in the state, and could change Alaska's technology infrastructure for the better.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/>"

The project is a 2-year multi-instrument observational program to determine the relationship between optical flickering observed in aurora and radio emissions from auroral roars. Optical flickering is common in active discrete arcs. The flickering spots are laterally vibrating columns of luminosity which tend to occur on the bottom edges of auroral arcs. The flicker frequency is typically between 2-20 Hz, with a lifetime of one flickering element of a few seconds. Auroral roar is a band limited radio emission generated in the auroral F-region at frequencies near 2 and 3 times the electron cyclotron frequency. The modulation frequency band is very similar to that of flickering aurora, and even though no connection has yet been made with flickering aurora itself, these types of radio emissions have been named ""flickering auroral roar"". This project will conduct joint optical and radio observations at Kaktovik Alaska to address the question of the link between flickering in the two types of auroral emissions. At Kaktovik, on the north coast of Alaska, the Geophysical Institute has an optical observatory where flickering aurora is commonly observed. New optical instruments developed at both USAFA and GI will be deployed and operated at Kaktovik. In addition, Dartmouth College currently operates a digital Medium Frequency Interferometer there with support from National Science Foundation (NSF) and collaboration with the principal investigator (PI) on this instrument has been established to provide the radio observations required for this study. The project also will take advantage of a number of already planned rocket launches that will provide in-situ measurements from the upper atmosphere over Kaktovik. Under-graduate cadets from USAFA as well as a graduate student from GI will participate in the project."

It is therefore an important arena for testing theories regarding dispersal and survival of many species.  Climate has shifted rapidly in this region, and recent warming trends are predicted to be strongest in the Arctic.  Small mammals, such as the collared pika, provide important information on the effects of climate change.  Collared pikas are found only on talus slopes in Alaska and northwest Canada. This is one of only two species of North American pikas, and their range is far to the north of the other species. When the fossil record of pikas is contrasted with genetic data, a history of recent range contraction and subsequent rapid expansion is suggested for collared pikas. This is consistent with the idea that collared pikas entered their northern habitat from refugia in the south, and not from Russia.<br/><br/>This award supports the research of a doctoral degree candidate at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. The study has implications for understanding the persistence and evolution of lineages in arctic and subarctic ecosystems. It will help determine the rate of faunal turnover in northern regions, and distinguish between chance events and recurrent evolutionary trends.

In 1986, a Chapman Conference on Fast Glacier Flow was held to bring together scientists who were actively involved in the study of surging and fast tidewater glaciers, and ice stream flow. The meeting illuminated several outstanding problems which contributed to numerous inter-disciplinary studies in the Antarctic and Arctic.<br/><br/>Since 1986, there have been many important new developments in our understanding of the properties and processes involved in fast glacier flow and of its consequences in the global climate and ocean systems.  For example, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet initiative has brought the roles of highly deformable subglacial till and marginal shear-zone ice dynamics to the forefront as important processes in fast glacier motion.  This research has led to new approaches in the study of surging glaciers in the Arctic.  Detailed studies of outlet glaciers in Greenland and tidewater glaciers in Alaska have been important in determining the roles of fast glacier flow and iceberg calving in ice sheet mass balance, as well as their roles in ice sheet disintegration and their effects on ocean circulation through Heinrich-type events.  New remote sensing techniques have been used to illuminate features of ice stream flow and surge-type glaciers in both Antarctica and the Arctic, including the identification of a large ice stream in northeast Greenland and possible rapid drawdown of the Pine Island/Thwaites drainage basins in Antarctica.  <br/><br/>Because of these exciting new developments, the Principal Investigator will host an International Symposium on Fast Glacier Flow in 2002 sponsored by the International Glaciological Society in Yakutat, Alaska.  Yakutat is located among the largest and most active tidewater and surging glaciers in the North America.  The meeting will be organized through the Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska - Fairbanks.  This proposal seeks funds to partially defray the cost of organizing and carrying out this symposium.<br/><br/>Bringing together Antarctic and Arctic scientists working on these different aspects of rapid ice motion should promote vigorous discussion and an exchange of ideas on the current state of knowledge.  The symposium will focus on the most pressing unanswered questions of fast glacier flow, leading to discussions of future directions for international, inter-disciplinary research.  Peer-reviewed papers resulting from oral and poster presentations at the symposium will be published in the Annals of Glaciology.<br/>"

It is being funded by the Office of Polar Programs, Division of Environmental Biology and Ecology, and Ecosystem Studies.  Over the next five years, the Principal Investigators will address spatial-temporal variation in plant herbivore interactions and associated ecosystem processes in a goose grazing system in coastal tundra of the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) Delta, Alaska.  Their fundamental hypothesis is that interactions between herbivores and early successional states are tightly coupled, such that herbivores require these early successional states for successful production of offspring.  Furthermore, herbivores not only maintain, but are capable of creating these early successional states by grazing associated activities.  Moreover, spatial/temporal complexity in vegetation patterns and the response of herbivores to habitat patches introduce substantial complexity into succession, ecosystem processes and herbivore population dynamics.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigators will examine four inter-linked hypotheses: 1) the influence of herbivory on succession; 2) the influence of herbivory on nutrient cycling processes; 3) time lags in the successional response of vegetation to herbivory; and 4) the role that temporal-spatial patterns in herbivory play in determining ecosystem state.  This proposal builds on a 16-year study of nutrition and other factors other factors on demography of the black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) geese that nest on the coast of the Y-K Delta, and on seven years of research on vegetation/ ecosystem response to herbivory.  This study takes advantage of a large sample of individually marked brant that will provide the team with an unprecedented opportunity to measure demographic responses of herbivores to the quality and quantity of their food.  Intensive herbivory sophisticated experiments on the effects of herbivory on soil processes.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigators will use a modified version of a spatial ecosystem model (SAVANNA) to test hypotheses what could not otherwise be examined about the relationship between spatial patterns of herbivory and ecosystem state.  SAVANNA will be directly linked to a goose population model to fully incorporate herbivore dynamics into their hypothesis testing, and the field experiments are designed to allow them to parameterize SAVANNA for coastal tundra.  Modeling will also serve to guide full integration of their field experiments and monitoring across trophic levels.<br/>The current project also will link research on the same population of geese and associated wetland habitats in Mexico. This may be the first study to fully integrate dynamics of soil processes, vegetation and herbivory in an ecosystem context at such a broad spatial scale.<br/>"

In lower latitudes, beaver damming can convert streams, backwaters, and lake outlets into connected ponds, which in turn can change the course of channels, temperature of streams, sediment loads, energy exchange, aquatic habitat diversity and nutrient cycling, and riparian vegetation. In the Arctic, effects of beavers may include enhanced thawing of permafrost, increased stream temperatures, and changes in seasonal ice in streams, as well as complex ecosystem responses. This study will 1) document movement of beavers from the forest into tundra regions, 2) understand how stream engineering wrought by beavers will change the arctic tundra landscape and streams, and 3) predict how beavers will expand into tundra regions and alter stream and adjacent ecosystems. Results will be of interest to local communities and resource managers, and the team of investigators will convene a scientist and stakeholder workshop in Fairbanks, Alaska to synthesize observations, compare results from studies in temperate ecosystems, and clarify impacts of beaver expansion unique to the tundra biome. The project also includes support for a postdoctoral scientist.<br/><br/>In this project, the investigators will combine a novel remote sensing technique that detects beavers in satellite imagery, a field campaign that includes drone imaging, and beaver habitat modeling to understand how beaver expansion in Alaska is altering arctic stream and riparian ecosystems. They will use a semi-automated workflow to analyze Landsat imagery, high resolution satellite imagery, and historic aerial photography to identify the formation and disappearance of beaver ponds and map beaver dispersal into and impacts on arctic tundra regions of Alaska since 1950. To document the short- and long-term effects of beavers on the physical environment, the team will focus on field sites with chronosequences of beaver establishment, as well as those where beavers are absent. Landscape models will use attributes of current beaver habitat to identify other suitable habitat across the Alaskan arctic tundra and compare it to beaver habitat in temperate ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Investigators will analyze existing data to determine how shifts in climate properties over time may have affected commercially important fishes in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA).  For several decades, significant relationships between sea surface temperature (SST) and abundance of a broad group of marine organisms in the GOA offered some promise for incorporating environmental data into fisheries management strategies. However, many of these statistical connections deteriorated abruptly in the late 1980s, while at the same time interactions between GOA SST and other aspects of climate conditions changed as well. This study will test the hypothesis that a switch in large-scale climate variability in the 1980s led to reorganization of relationships among GOA atmospheric and oceanographic properties, which in turn, produced a change in connection between temperature and ocean biology. These types of ""no-analogue climate states"" are well recognized in paleoecology and have been anticipated as a potential outcome of climate change, but few studies of ecological response to such switches are available. The project will support a postdoctoral scientist, as well as graduate and undergraduate student researchers. It will facilitate cooperation among scientists at three public universities, a non-profit research lab, and a federal management agency in order to combine the range of expertise that will be required to carry out this research.<br/><br/>This research has the potential to transform our understanding of how climate affects marine ecosystems. It is based on preliminary analyses showing that the statistical relationships between SST and community state in the Gulf of Alaska appear to be nonstationary, with driver-response relationships that differ markedly before and after 1988/89.  Preliminary analyses also show that correlations between SST and a number of other GOA climate parameters are significantly different before and after 1988/89.  Additionally, leading modes in North Pacific SST anomalies for 1950-present changed their relative importance before and after 1988/89, with the second mode (North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, or NPGO) explaining more variability than the first mode (Pacific Decadal Oscillation, or PDO) during the past three decades. This change is consistent with a switch to a no-analogue climate state, characterized by markedly different patterns of variability among basin-scale climate processes. The proposed hypothesis will be tested with a combination of statistical ecological models and numerical ocean models. The statistical approach (threshold generalized additive models) will provide formal tests for nonstationary relationships between SST variability and ecological characteristics at the community and population level using time series data (1965-present) for 17 salmon, groundfish and crustacean populations from the GOA. In addition, nonstationary relationships among atmospheric and hydrographic processes at basin and regional scales will be tested with time series generated by ocean data-assimilation and hindcast models.  Finally, those nonstationary relationships identified will be used to parameterize statistical models of biological variability that account for non-analogous states in the system."

The faculty team is led by John Eichelberger, University of Alaska, Fairbanks, Evgenii Gordeev, Institute of Volcanology and Seismology in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russia, and Takehiro Koyaguchi, University of Tokyo, Japan. Volcanoes are among the most exciting and inspiring, as well as dangerous phenomena on the planet Earth and this project uses one of the most volcanically active regions of the world as a natural laboratory. Understanding volcanoes has become increasingly important as growing population and technical complexity of society make us more vulnerable to natural catastrophe and as we realize the role of volcanism in global change. By conducting an integrated comparison of these three especially violent analogous systems at different times since their eruptions over the last 50 years, this project will advance our understanding of how magma is stored in the crust, how eruptions are triggered, and how sector collapse affects future eruptive behavior. <br/><br/>The trinational collaboration is essential to carrying out the project analyses because the scientists from each nation will contribute different and complementary expertise. The collaboration continues and expands cooperation among U.S., Russian and Japanese institutions, and establishes the foundation for long-term research and training among these countries in the northern Pacific Rim.  These efforts will enhance volcano hazard monitoring capabilities in the future by improving our understanding of the processes behind these large explosive eruptions and by training internationally-engaged young volcanologists. The project is notable for developing international research teams of faculty and students that will undertake field research in Kamchatka, in Alaska, and at Mount St. Helens. The graduate students will be trained in multiple approaches in geophysics, physical volcanology, modeling, and petrology. The students will also have language and culture training in Russian and will take short courses at Kamchatka State Pedagogical University with Russian and Japanese graduate students. This project will develop a cadre of scholars that are fluent in international collaborative approaches, with increased understanding of both the cultures and the cultures of science in the three nations. The teams will stay connected by frequent regular webcast seminars and meetings that will start before the field work and continue after field data is collected to ensure an integrated and collaborative analysis of the data.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Division of Earth Sciences. <br/>"

Additional facilities                      provided by the USDA/Forest Service will further enhance the work               as will other support in kind from that source.

In a similar fashion it is expected - and documented               for its earliest phases - that this project will easily integrate               itself into the network of similar ongoing projects in a major                  contributory role.

Large portions of Siberia, Alaska, and northwestern Canada formed an unglaciated land-mass during the late Pleistocene known as Beringia.  Previous Beringian paleoclimatic studies have yielded only qualitative temperature estimates. There is a need to develop quantitative estimates to gain a better understanding of the magnitude and regional expression of climate change.  The Principal Investigators will attempt to quantify the paleotemperatures through the analysis of fossil insects, pollen, and plant macrofossils using thermoluminescence (TL) dating. They will use the Mutual Climatic Range (MCR) method of fossil beetle analysis and paleobotanical studies to produce estimates of mean temperatures of the warmest (TMAX) and coldest months (TMIN), as well as estimates of mean annual temperature (MAT).  They will reconstruct past environments at the five study sites in central and northern Alaska with sediments ranging in age from the end of isotope stage 6 to the Holocene.  The Principal Investigators will focus on samples from just before and during the last interglacial interval.  They will date sediments from 140-50 thousand years by TL and its newer variant, photon-stimulated-luminescence. <br/><br/>Two research themes will be addressed.  The first theme is to study the nature of the climatic transition of stage 6 to stage 5 and to determine where the Old Crow tephra fits in this sequence.  The second research theme is to determine the nature of climatic amelioration in Beringia during the last interglacial period.<br/>"

The maps will be derived from Doppler shifts of the atomic oxygen auroral emission line at 557.7 nm.  While several other ground and spaced-based techniques exist for measuring E-region winds, they are all difficult, and they do not duplicate the coverage and resolution that is anticipated in this project.  The wind maps will cover a geographic region approximately 700 km in diameter, centered on Poker Flat, Alaska.  This fully includes the E-region field of view of the National Science Foundation's new AMISR radar.  Vertical coverage will span approximately 110 km to 140 km.  With the mapping region resolved into 60 to 100 sub-fields, integration times for a single map will vary between one and five minutes, depending on signal levels, for typical uncertainties of a few meters per second.  Doppler temperature maps will also be obtained with the same spatial and temporal resolution, with typical uncertainties of less than 10K.  A number of scientific studies will be conducted.  All depend on combining E-region wind maps with data from other instruments monitoring the same field of view, including the Poker Flat AMISR radar.  Topics to be studied include the role of ion-neutral momentum coupling in E-region neutral dynamics at small (< 100 km) spatial scales, the role of horizontal transport in the evolution of storm-induced thermospheric composition perturbations, horizontal velocity perturbations due to gravity waves, the role of neutral winds in determining the partitioning of magnetospheric energy deposition between heating and bulk motion of the neutral atmosphere, and the relationship between horizontal divergence and vertical wind in the E- and F-regions.  The project includes work to significantly upgrade the instrument's self-calibration capability with a 5-color helium neon laser, a new frequency stabilized laser, and an automated calibration source viewing system.  In addition to CEDAR-specific science topics, a number of broader impacts are anticipated.  A graduate student will be supported to participate in this research, whose work will be integral to all aspects of the project.  With a major emphasis on optical calibration, this project has obvious relevance to the University of Alaska's 400-level undergraduate optics class - which is required for all physics majors.  Aspects of both the optical design and the resulting calibration data will be incorporated into the students' laboratory and homework projects.  The E-region wind mapping would add to the infrastructure of atmospheric science at a general level by demonstrating a new capability that other experimenters could exploit according to their research needs.  More specifically, there is a high degree of synergy with two major existing NSF funded projects at Poker Flat:  The AMISR radar and a tristatic array of three narrow-field Fabry-Perot spectrometers."

There is a lot of it in frozen ground, called permafrost, in the Arctic that can be released as the permafrost thaws, so warming in the Arctic can lead to more warming, a so-called positive feedback. Understanding such feedbacks is an important part of understanding how the arctic system works. Much of this process occurs at the bottoms of lakes, where some of the methane is frozen in lake sediments beneath the lake, but some also comes from under the permafrost deep under the lake. Methane release from the sub-permafrost environment under lakes would be a new and poorly understood feedback to the climate system.<br/><br/>This project is a first step in exploring these processes within the hydrology-permafrost-methane lake-to-watershed system to inform future biogeochemical models for methane release. Since lakes in areas of discontinuous permafrost are common, the proposed study domain will offer process-oriented insights that are applicable across the Arctic.<br/><br/>The project will also train postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students and support an early-career scientist. In addition there will be outreach to science teachers and their students in fieldwork and classroom activities on lakes and integration of results into K-G12 curriculum through the National Geographic Society's Learning program, and to millions of National Geographic magazine readers, television viewers and K- G12 students. Further, the efforts will contribute to the Alaska Geological and Hydrological Survey program to develop a detailed understanding of Alaska's groundwater systems via the central involvement of the Alaska Geological and Geophysical Survey.<br/><br/>Technical<br/><br/>Uncertainties in the budget of atmospheric methane (CH4), an important greenhouse gas released by thermokarst lakes, limit the accuracy of climate change projections. The objective of this grant is to refine climate feedback representations by integrating permafrost-hydrology-methane processes across scales (thermokarst-lake to watershed). Methane release from thermokarst lakes is typically considered to be solely derived from the lake and its talik (thaw bulb beneath the lake), while not accounting for the production, storage, and potential escape of CH4 beneath the permafrost. A rugged permafrost bottom is proposed to favor gas storage in hollow ""pockets"", which can rapidly release large sub(below)- permafrost CH4 stores when an open-talik forms that connects the sub-permafrost to the supra(above)- permafrost environment. Groundwater flow could accelerate thaw and therefore enhance CH4 formation and release. Model experiments informed by field measurements and laboratory analyses at Goldstream Valley, Interior Alaska, will test the hypothesis that the coupled hydrology-permafrost-methane system releases more CH4 than a scenario with static hydrology and only supra-permafrost CH4 sources. The resulting radiative forcing will be quantified via conceptual modeling, also informed by field measurements and laboratory analyses, to include talik and sub-permafrost CH4 and CO2 emissions, anaerobic oxidation of sub-permafrost CH4, and CO2 uptake and sequestration as lake sediments form peat. In addition to a watershed-scale quantification, a first order estimation of the sub-permafrost derived radiative forcing will be provided for the pan-arctic discontinuous permafrost domain of yedoma (organic-rich, Pleistocene-aged, loess-dominated permafrost)."

This planning effort is aligned with NSF?s new vision for ERCs: it features a strong social impact as described above, incorporates convergence by drawing from across a wide array of disciplines, features a diverse stakeholder community advisory committee to ensure broad engagement, and incorporates specific expertise in team science organization and science communication. This project also aligns with two of NSF's Grand Challenges: Navigating the New Arctic and Growing Convergent Research. <br/><br/>Key components and deliverables include a dedicated fellow to coordinate planning activities, two community innovation festivals, and a year-long seminar series to enhance stakeholder connections. The community festivals will explore questions around convergence, stakeholder community, team formation and effective leadership and management, and societal impact. Information from these discussions will be synthesized into different levels of maps and spatial representations, which will be overlaid to find connections, gaps, and needs. These conceptual maps will be constructed for local resource availability, landscape parameters, social livability factors, educational and innovation pathways, and global impacts, factors that will ultimately form the components of ERCA2050.

The goal is to understand processes that remain outside of current general circulation models (GCM's). These processes reflect ""surprises"" that reduce the reliability of GCM's to predict climate change because of limited understanding of the role of biotic and ecosystem feedbacks to regional and global dynamics. This project involves an integrative, large-scale field experiment in the boreal forest along with studies of paleoecological dynamics, and fire and climate modeling. The project will integrate measurements of forest dynamics following burning, soil processes, trace gas fluxes, and paleoecological reconstruction of vegetation and climate. The research will be conducted in association with the Bonanza Creek LTER program in Alaska. Once the field experiments are established, the long-term monitoring of field manipulation and experimental burning treatments initiated in this TECO project will become part of the Bonanza Creek  LTER program.

The Cook Inlet forearc basin is the largest active forearc basin in North America, with dimensions 200 km by 100 km and a depth of 7.6 km. The basin has remained a site of sedimentation and subsidence over the past 160 Ma of convergence and accretion along the southern Alaska margin. The basin is part of a 50-km thick crust overlying a freely slipping plate interface, just downdip from the rupture extent of the Mw 1964 9.2 earthquake. A high-magnetic, low-gravity, continental-scale signal known as the Southern Alaska Magnetic High (SAMH) coincides with Cook Inlet basin. The origin of this signal has been proposed to result from either an ancient accreted magmatic arc within the crust, or a serpentinized zone within the mantle wedge. We assume that the structural body associated with the SAMH has driven forearc basin formation over geological time scales. By characterizing the three-dimensional seismic structure of the basin-crust-slab-mantle system, it should be possible to isolate the origin of the SAMH and, in turn, the origin of a globally significant forearc basin.<br/><br/>Sedimentary basins pose major challenges for seismic imaging. Basin reverberations of seismic waves complicate efforts to image underlying and adjacent portions of the subduction system, including the lower crust, uppermost mantle, and subducting slab. Three components are needed to derive a high-quality seismic structural model of the Cook Inlet region: (1) seismic imaging capabilities to handle both the structural complexities of the three-dimensional model and details within full seismic waveforms; (2) maximal distribution local earthquakes to enhance resolution; and (3) an array of strategically placed broadband seismometers.<br/><br/>We plan a two-year EarthScope FlexArray deployment of 30 seismic stations to target (1) the 50-km thick continental crust containing Cook Inlet basin, and (2) a 400-km long arc-normal transect of the subduction zone across the basin, through Redoubt volcano, and into the backarc region. With a phenomenal rate of seismicity within the crust and subducting slab, the region of Cook Inlet offers a world-class opportunity for seismic imaging of subduction tectonics. By isolating the seismic signals due to the basin, it will be possible to image deeper structure and processes within the lower crust, upper mantle, and subducting Pacific slab. We plan to harness the accuracy of full wavefield simulations within an adjoint-based imaging technique that has proven successful in southern California. A complete characterization of the structural setting will result from detailed investigations of local and teleseismic shear-wave splitting measurements to infer mantle flow patterns, in addition to a synthesis of tectonic stresses inferred from hundreds of M > 3 moment tensors from earthquakes within the crust and slab."

It has been stable for 33 years, but rapidly began to calve and retreat in December 1994.  It has receded one kilometer over nine-months and is calving into 270-meter deep water.  This proposal addresses many of the key issues and recommendations from the recent National Science Foundation (NSF)-sponsored tidewater glacier workshop.  Previous studies on similar glaciers have focused on processes at and near the terminus.  In this study, the Principal Investigators will measure and characterize a number of parameters along the entire length of the glacier and not just the snout or terminus.  The objectives are to:  1) understand what controls the stability of calving glaciers; 2) characterize glacier calving, especially submarine events; and 3) measure and characterize proglacial sedimentation to assess its effects on the dynamics and stability of calving glaciers.  Because the LeConte Glacier is rapidly calving, this is a ""time-critical"" study and it is important to begin collecting data while the glacier is in the initial stages of the calving retreat.  Repeated airborne elevation profiling, which has not been preciously used on glaciers, will be used to measure changes in surface geometry along the full length of the glacier on a seasonal and annual basis.  <br/>"

Proposed explanations for the transient deformation after great earthquakes include viscoelastic response, aseismic creep and combinations of the two.  Different models of postseismic viscoelastic relaxation predict observable gravity changes over 1000 km length scales, with a complex spatial pattern.  To date, the viscosity profile is best determined by postglacial rebound studies.  Gravity and GPS measurements offer the opportunity to obtain viscosity profile estimates for the Alaskan plate boundary. The area is especially interesting, as the viscosity of subduction zone materials may be very different from that beneath the centers of continental and oceanic plates.  Aseismic creep is predicted to produce deformation of a more limited and markedly different spatial character than that of viscoelastic relaxation.  Determining the contribution of aseismic creep in postseismic deformation is important in estimating recurrence intervals for great earthquakes.<br/><br/>This project is establishing a baseline gravity network of fifteen stations in Alaska.  The bulk of the network forms a transect perpendicular to the predicted contours of maximum gravity change in the far field.  Additional points are located within the deformation near field.  Gravity measurements are collocated with existing GPS stations.  These initial measurements form the basis for testing different postseismic deformation models.  Additional activities include collecting auxiliary data to correct the gravity data for signals such as water table variations.  A portion of a 1964-1965 relative gravity survey is being repeated as well, in order to determine the total gravity change over the Kenai Peninsula since the earthquake.

Two broad types of processes are usually proposed: horizontal compression, which results in crustal thickening and support of mountains by Moho deflections, and dynamic uplift mechanisms, which heat the lithosphere or elevate it by subduction-induced flow.  The PASSCAL seismic line of stations follows a corridor that typifies mountain building over a subducting slab with North America's highest topography directly over the 100 km depth contour of the slab where arc volcanism might be expected.  Analysis efforts will focus on receiver functions, attenuation and travel time studies, and shear-wave splitting.  Results will be integrated with topography and gravity observations of mass distributions, in order to examine whether these are sufficient to isostatically balance topography.

This project will use newly developed techniques to reconstruct salmon abundance trends from stable isotopic analysis of lake sediment cores.  Several sites will be studied in each of the California Current and Northern Gulf of Alaska systems to compare trends within and between regions.  The records of salmon abundance will be compared with paleoclimatic data determined from studies of tree rings, glacial advances and other sources.  Long-term records of salmon abundance will be reconstructed by analyses of stable nitrogen isotopes in sediment cores.  This new application of N stable isotopes is based on the observation that Pacific salmon supply measurable quantities of elements into freshwater systems when they return to spawn.  Nitrogen derived from adult salmon is enriched in 15N relative to terrestrially-derived N. and thus past changes in the number of returning adult salmon are reflected by downcore changes in sedimentary delta15N.  The stable isotopes of sulfur also have potential to trace salmon-derived elements into freshwater ecosystems, because there is a large difference between marine and terrestrial signatures of delta34S. Because N and S have different geochemical controls and different geochemical cycling processes, the use of both tracers should lead to a robust reconstruction of salmon abundance."

Specifically, they will try to better understand the processes of internal accumulation of ice within firn to better predict how climate change impacts glacier dynamics and volume change. This work follows five years of research by this team and 50 years of research within the long-term McCall Glacier research project. <br/><br/>Scientific Merit.  Prior research has shown that the surface mass balance (SMB) of arctic glaciers in Alaska is increasingly negative, with late-summer snow lines ascending higher than the glacier elevations in the last several years. But traditional SMB measurements via stakes do not account for internal accumulation of ice by refreezing of meltwater within firn and crevasses, which in recent years would account for 100% of the annual accumulation since there was no surface accumulation. With mean annual air temperatures of roughly -10 degrees C in Alaska's arctic glaciers, there is no opportunity to capture as much as half the winter snow pack within the subsurface, and not accounting for this mass hampers our ability understand and predict change. With snow lines rising throughout the Arctic, the processes of internal accumulation are becoming increasingly important globally as formerly dry firn areas begin melting. The Principal Investigators will improve prediction rates of internal accumulation from weather conditions through intensive field studies.  This information will be used to further improve Hock's mass balance models; then these can be used to reconstruct a complete mass balance record for the past 50 years using regional climate models as input and the past 15 years of field SMB and weather records as calibration. This cumulative record will be compared with volume change calculated using a 50 year map-comparison using a new topographic map made for this project. Hindcasts and forecasts of mass balance will then be used to drive Pattyn's finite difference thermo-mechanical flow-line model. In previous work with this model, they found that if the climate remains unchanged, all the glaciers within arctic Alaska would disappear within a few hundred years. However, through comparisons with speed and surface elevation time-series of the past 50 years, they believe the model's predicted response is slower than actual, as it is poorly constrained for rates of internal accumulation, ice temperatures, and ice fabrics. Based on this research, they will construct a time-series of volume loss from 1890 to 2100 using volume-area scaling for nearly all of the glaciers in the geographically-defined US Arctic. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This research will also extend and improve the existing 50-year record of McCall Glacier, which has intrinsic value to glaciology as the only such record in the US Arctic. This project will help support at least two graduate students and one post-doc, and will result in a series of professional papers, as well as popular<br/>press articles and public lectures using their expanding collections of repeat-photo pairs that qualitatively document ecological change in the Arctic to help explain the significance of our research.<br/>"

In central Alaska, the climate was changing rapidly as the world transitioned from glacial to modern climate conditions between 20,000 and 5,000 years before present. This triggered the spread of the forest, expansion, extinction, and/or redistribution of game animals (such as elk, bison, and moose), and the establishment of salmon streams. Various well-established methods, such as bone and plant identification, shed light on this past resource use, however, challenges in the identification or preservation of these samples can yield an incomplete picture of human activity. Ancient DNA extracted from archaeological sediments can address these challenges, but the preservation of the ancient DNA in sediments that are unfrozen for part of the year - sediments that are typical of many Arctic contexts - is currently untested. This project will assess new and transformational methodologies on ancient DNA that can add a new view on the relationship between humans and their environment thousands of years ago. <br/><br/>In this study, ancient DNA results will be rigorously analyzed to assess preservation and sampling issues that may result from sediments that are unfrozen for four months of the year - a methodological challenge that has yet to be tested. The project team will compare ancient DNA results from archaeological sediments that are unfrozen about four months of the year, which are typical of central Alaska, with a sediment type that has been shown to preserve ancient DNA (lake sediments) to assess the reliability of ancient DNA results from these new contexts.

In the tundra and boreal forest, large amounts of water are released during a short period (2 to 3 weeks) in spring when the winter's snow rapidly melts. Most of this snowmelt water flows out through rivers, because the ground is mostly frozen during snowmelt, while the remaining sizable fraction of snowmelt water is thought to be lost through evaporation or sublimation, or to groundwater recharge in those areas where permafrost doesn't prevent it. Uptake and storage by plants at this time of year has been considered negligible. Preliminary data from a small watershed in interior Alaska shows that deciduous trees take up 25-40% of the snowmelt water prior to leaf out and draw from these stores throughout the summer, including during lengthy dry periods. Preliminary data also show that arctic deciduous shrub stems rise and fall diurnally as the snow melts, which the investigators suspect is linked with water uptake, but the link between shrub water content and snowmelt is unknown. Water uptake by deciduous trees and shrubs has important ecosystem implications, from the water balance to climate feedbacks to coping strategies of deciduous vegetation during dry periods. The observed expansion of deciduous shrubs and trees in Alaska during the 20th century is likely altering the water balance and Arctic ecosystem in ways currently not being considered.<br/><br/>The investigators ask: To what extent do deciduous vegetation (trees and shrubs) use snowmelt water? What are the consequences of deciduous tree and shrub expansion on the ecohydrology of northern ecosystems? What are the plant ecological consequences (such as buffering from weather variability) of the storage and use of snowmelt water? They propose to characterize shrub and tree physiology (water uptake, water stress, transpiration, growth, photosynthesis), as well as environmental variables, including snowmelt, across a climate gradient in Alaska. These data will be integrated into statistical models that will quantify the controls on snowmelt water uptake by trees and shrubs, and will quantify the role of snowmelt water in sustaining physiological activity during dry periods. The proposal addresses emerging avenues of ecohydrology by quantifying the role of deciduous plants on the pathways and reservoirs of snowmelt water, and by assessing the potential for stored snowmelt water to buffer vegetation during dry periods. The transformative nature of the proposed work lies in reconsidering the dogma that vegetation plays a minor role in snowmelt hydrological processes. This reconsideration is salient given the observed widespread expansion of deciduous trees and shrubs and observed advancing snowmelt dates. The project would support two early career investigators, a PhD student, and 3 undergraduate students. Several distinct outreach activities are proposed, including teacher workshops aimed at enhancing the science curriculum of local and rural Alaskan K-12 classrooms, a traveling museum exhibit, an art exhibit featuring the work of the lead PI, and a partnership with a science writer for statewide dissemination of one article per year in statewide (Alaska) news outlets."

The United States hosts a number of recently active and potentially hazardous volcanoes with most located in Alaska. Volcanoes that erupt intermediate SiO2 composition magmas are common in Alaska (e.g., Mt. Augustine) and elsewhere in the world. They are typically water and crystal-rich, frequently active and produce eruptions that cycle between small lava domes and violent, ash-producing, Vulcanian-style explosions. Magmas degas as gas bubbles exsolve, grow, coalesce into larger bubbles, and then connect together to form permeable pathways through the magma that allow gas to escape. The driving force behind explosive eruptions is how easily the magma can release the gas pressure that builds as magma rises in the conduit, balanced against how fast the magma ascends to the surface. Prior results indicate that as the magma's crystal content increases, the solid crystals could modify the degassing process by allowing the bubbles to connect and the magma to become permeable at lower gas contents, although the mechanism by which this happens is poorly understood. The primary goal of this study is to examine and quantify how crystal content may influence magma degassing, using experiments that approximate the conditions of magma ascent in the sub-volcanic plumbing system. The experiments will be designed to apply generally to intermediate composition volcanoes anywhere in the world. However, the experimental results will be tested by application to the 2006 eruption of Augustine Volcano, Alaska through a comparison with natural samples from that eruption. This research will allow geoscientists to better understand the mechanisms responsible for the effusive to explosive eruption style that occurs often in crystal-rich, intermediate composition magmas in subduction zone volcanoes, like those in Alaska and elsewhere around the world. <br/><br/>This research will employ high-pressure and temperature, cold-seal decompression experiments to examine how crystal populations and/or matrix melt compositions may significantly influence permeability development in magmas.  Specific goals of the research include: 1) quantification of the relative importance of phenocryst versus microlite crystallinity; 2) the timescales of permeability development and degassing in hydrous intermediate magmas relative to the timescales of eruption; 3) how crystals influence pore microstructure that controls permeable gas flow; 4) the influence crystals and/or melt composition may have on the development of permeability anisotropy in magmas during and after eruption. The experiments will be conducted under controlled conditions approximating magma ascent in the conduit, and rapidly quenched to preserve vesicle structures that evolve during decompression. The quenched samples will be analyzed using a novel combination of lab-based electrical conductivity measurements to probe the morphology of the pore structure, combined with 3-D X-ray tomography analyses to 'image' the structure of the degassing pathways in the experiments. The results will be used to constrain the timescales and depths of magma degassing in the context of Vulcanian - lava dome cycles at hydrous intermediate arc volcanoes. For example, the experiments can be used to constrain how fast magma degassing and outgassing can lead to the formation of a dense plug or lava dome capping the conduit, and then the subsequent build up of gas pressure beneath that leads to ash producing Vulcanian explosions. When included in the broader context of volcano monitoring, the results from this study will help us better define the timescales over which effusive to explosive cycling occurs in arc volcanoes, and can be compared with pre and syn-eruptive geophysical monitoring data, leading to improved eruption forecasting in the future."

While low temperatures and short-growing seasons limit plant growth, enough plant biomass exists to support herds of migratory caribou, on which Alaska Natives depend. Any changes in the plants at the base of the food web can have cascading consequences for herbivores and human consumers and their interactions. Today, the Arctic system is in the midst of change resulting in new vegetation assemblages, changes in the nutritive value of plant tissues, and ultimately in the diets of migratory caribou and the humans that depend on them. This project examines the nutritional landscape of the Central Arctic Caribou Herd as a unifying concept, describing the nutritional landscape as caribou available protein (CAP) and caribou available energy&#8232;(CAE), integrative forage quantity measures that reflect biomass, species composition, plant&#8232;C and N content, digestibility, and secondary compounds. The core objectives are gaining understanding of the drivers of spatial and temporal patterns in the amounts of CAP and CAE across the tundra; caribou use of this nutritional landscape; how the amounts of CAP and CAE will differ in the future under likely climate scenarios and long-term experiments, and the interactions between caribou and Native communities. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this study involve several groups of Alaskan stakeholders, including: harvesters of the North Slope community of Nuiqsut, the worldwide caribou community, and students at multiple stages of education. The project will embed a team member with hunters in Nuiqsut,&#8232;and develop an educational scientific documentary on the caribou - Alaska Native interactions for&#8232;high school students. The group plans to employ village students and undergraduates affiliated with the Alaska Native Science&#8232;and Engineering Program to assist with experimental work and vegetation collection at Toolik Lake. This research is significant to ecologists from the Circumarctic Rangifer Monitoring&#8232;and Assessment Network, dedicated&#8232;to caribou conservation and sustainable management in the US, Canada, and Scandinavia, who will use the data to consider how a suite of climate change scenarios affect herd fecundity and population dynamics. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project stems from the merging of five elements to understand Arctic&#8232;System function and response to climate change: (1) A landscape-scale assessment of plant species, soil and plant C and N, digestibility, and secondary compounds that will be used&#8232;to calculate the amounts of CAP (kg m-2) and CAE (kJ m-2); (2) analysis of how closely caribou foraging is tied to the nutritional landscape throughout the year; (3) analysis of samples&#8232;from an existing long-term winter - summer climate change experiment to provide data on how&#8232;CAP and CAE will differ in the future; (4) prediction of future nutritional landscapes and&#8232;caribou foraging interactions; and (5) observations of Alaska Native hunter harvesting and attributes&#8232;of the system that determine their spatial and temporal patterns. These project components will enable an integrative understanding of how an important herbivore, caribou, interact with a landscape that is rapidly changing. This research: (1) examines the Arctic System from primary production to secondary consumers and the&#8232;influence of climate change across multiple trophic levels; (2) applies broadly by examining&#8232;the most abundant large herbivore and its food sources, both of which are distributed throughout&#8232;the Arctic; and (3) integrates experimental, observational, and modeling approaches to understanding ecological systems and climate change. The integration of observation, experimental data&#8232;and modeling to describe current and forecast future nutritional landscapes is intended to provide a&#8232;mechanistic understanding of Arctic System function and transform the understanding&#8232;of climate-vegetation-caribou-subsistence hunter interactions."

Relative to the (overriding) North American plate, sites in the eastern part of the peninsula move in the direction of relative Pacific-North America plate motion, while sites in the western part of the peninsula move trenchward, roughly opposite to the direction of relative plate motion.  A number of physical models, with differing implications for the kinematics and dynamics of the subduction zone, might explain these results.  A better spatial distribution of data and more precise vertical motion rates are needed to distinguish between models.

The latter event is one of the largest strike-slip earthquakes to occur in the United States.  Intense ground shaking lasted over 45 seconds.  By comparison, the M7.1 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake lasted 15 seconds.  The Denali fault earthquakes caused ground failure and damage to several structures and highway bridges.  However, considering the magnitude and associated energy release of the 3 November event, the damage was substantially less than expected.<br/><br/>This action is to support a group of engineers and scientists to collect perishable data from the October-November 2002 earthquake sequence on the Denali Fault, Alaska.  A nucleus of Alaskan scientists and engineers have agreed to cooperate with this research team and to satellite platform data that is stored for only a limited period of time.  It builds on the findings of a geotechnical engineering reconnaissance team that visited the affected areas within days following the earthquake sequence.  The objective is to archive bedrock motions, ground motions and fault offsets and their effects.  It includes the accumulation of all strong motion records, satellite imagery, satellite remote sensing data, aerial and ground photographs, and structural response (both measured and anecdotal).  Several interesting data sets will be archived, including ice cover, lateral movement of stream channels, landslides, avalanches, glacial fracturing, ""felt"" ground motions, and changes in water quantity and quality.  The data sources may be spatially integrated to provide a comprehensive assessment of the bedrock and ground motions and fault offsets.<br/><br/>The work of the reconnaissance team is a necessary prerequisite to understanding why the ground motions experienced did not substantially damage structures and the infrastructure.  Furthermore, it will facilitate a comparison of Denali events with the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the recent Kocelli and Dozce earthquake events in Turkey - all of which were associated with strike-slip faulting.  Finally, the spatially integrated data will provide the basis for further research.  For example, it can be used to model the observed landsliding and avalanches, changes in water quantity and quality, glacial fracturing, and the widespread liquefaction and lateral spreading that occurred along the Tok cutoff and Northway airport.<br/><br/>An Advisory Board will help identify and provide access to data sources, and make recommendations regarding the format for presentation of the project results to insure their widespread use by other investigators.

The project joins indigenous knowledge, language, and oral heritage with the material and chronometric evidence of archaeology, geology, and paleoenvironmental studies to document the cultural history and landscape of Yakutat Bay, where dramatic glacial recession after C. E. 1100 attracted major concentrations of harbor seals and opened the fiord for Sugpiaq, Eyak, Ahtna, and Tlingit settlement. The research team proposes that a clan-based system of local and external access rights developed around Yakutat sealing because of its economic centrality for peoples of the eastern Gulf of Alaska; that sealing camps shifted from the outer to the inner bay over time to follow the receding glacial front; and that the locations, artifact assemblages, faunal remains, and spatial layouts of camps express the cultural and social organization of hunting in different eras. They hypothesize that situated knowledge of Yakutat Bay's human and environmental history is encoded in living oral traditions and multilingual toponyms that richly delineate this nine-century cultural landscape, and that oral heritage can be chronologically correlated with archaeological and geological data. The study leads from the past to the present day, when the continuity of sealing and of the community's cultural and linguistic heritage are matters of urgent local concern. The methodologies and results of this study are highly relevant to questions of human adaptation and resiliency in the changing North and to the challenge of building coherence between indigenous and scientific knowledge systems."

The Noatak basin is a broad lowland in the  western Brooks Range of Alaska, drained by the west-flowing  Noatak River. During the late Pleistocene, large glaciers  extended down the Noatak River valley and terminated within the  basin. Other glaciers that originated farther west in the DeLong  Mountains flowed eastward into the basin, damming the Noatak  River and forming a succession of lakes with surface areas as  large as 4400 square kilometers. This project will bring together  a combination of approaches, including paleoecological analyses  (pollen, plant macrofossils, and insects), stratigraphy, and  geomorphology, to understand the paleoenvironmental records  preserved in deposits in the numerous large bluffs along the  Noatak and Cutler Rivers. The research focuses on organic-rich  sediments exposed in the bluffs. Basic stratigraphic and  geomorphologic mapping of these bluffs has already been  accomplished and test samples taken for paleoecological study in  1993 and 1994 have yielded abundant, well-preserved macrofossils  (plants and insects) and pollen assemblages. This project will  yield significant paleoenvironmental data that will be placed in  well-constrained chronological and stratigraphic contexts.         The Noatak basin contains an excellent record of the last  glacial/interglacial cycle, preserved in a series of organic  deposits exposed in river bluffs. Poorly drained lake beds cover  the floor of the Noatak basin, and associated end moraines  reflect glacial advances from mountains to the north, east, and  west. During interglacial and interstadial intervals, the Noatak  River and its tributaries incised these glacial deposits and  glaciolacustrine complexes. They formed gravel-filled channels  capped by organic-rich bog, marsh, and floodplain deposits. Sixty-  two measured sections of river-bluff exposures provide  a record  of depositional facies across the lake floor. The sedimentary  sequences exposed in the bluffs define multiple glacial advances  and corresponding lake stages separated by fluvial sediments of  both interstadial and interglacial character. Peat beds and  organic-rich silt horizons from floodplain deposits have yielded  identifiable wood, plant macrofossils, pollen, and insect  remains, and other fossils that serve as biostratigraphic markers  and provide paleoecological information.  Peats and organic-rich  silts and sands were deposited during several key intervals  throughout the last 135,000 years. The nine study sites that are  part of this project include organic deposits that most likely  date to the last interglacial period, the Boutellier (mid-  Wisconsin) interstadial, the late Wisconsin maximum, (27,000-  17,000 years ago), the late glacial interval (13,500-10,000 years  ago), and the Holocene.         The study region lies within the Noatak National Preserve,  one of the proposed component parks of the U.S./Russian Beringia  International Park. Its position near the eastern margin of the  Bering Land Bridge places it within a region where organic-rich  riparian habitats prevailed during even the last glacial maximum.  Paleoecological studies in the Noatak basin are essential to help  decipher an unusually long and complex record of Pleistocene  glaciation, modern landscape formation, and biotic response to  climate change. These studies will also provide the environmental  underpinning of the rich archaeological record that is presently  being reconstructed in the Noatak region."

Observations of antarctic                               stratospheric ozone depletion provide ample evidence of the                     uniqueness of polar atmospheric chemistry owing to extreme cold                 and prolonged darkness.  During the winter and spring months,                   the arctic troposphere contains elevated concentrations of                      aerosols and gases which are transported from lower latitudes.                  Little is known about the chemical processing and removal of                    the gas phase constituents.  The nitrogen oxides are a primary                  factor in controlling the tropospheric level of ozone.                          Tropospheric ozone, in turn, is believed to be increasing in                    the northern hemisphere.  Consequently, understanding the                       chemistry of the reactive nitrogen species is important.                             This project will measure the abundance of several gaseous                 nitrogen species including nitric oxide, nitric acid, total                     reactive odd nitrogen, and peroxyacetyl nitrate. These                          measurements will be complemented with determination of nitrate                 concentrations in aerosols, rain, snow, and snowpack.  Three                    primary questions will be addressed: (1) What are the                           concentrations of various nitrogen oxide species with respect                   to meteorological and temporal variations in central Alaska?                    (2) What is the chemical processing of these species and how is                 it related to ozone concentrations? and (3) How important is                    wet and dry deposition as a removal mechanism for these species                 in central Alaska?"

The GOA shelf supports a rich ecosystem that includes many commercially important fisheries. The basis for this productivity is enigmatic for the GOA shelf is deep, forced by downwelling-favorable winds, and fed by a massive nutrient-poor coastal freshwater discharge. Both the winds and the freshwater discharge are intimately linked to the strength and position of the Aleutian Low. The GOA ecosystem experiences substantial physical and biological changes on decadal and inter-annual time scales. Although some of these changes are correlated with various climatic indices a mechanistic understanding of climate change and ecosystem response is unavailable. The generic goal of this LTOP is to understand and quantify temporal (seasonal and interannual) and spatial (cross- and along-shelf) variations in the thermolialine, chemical, and biological pro-perties and relationships of this shelf. This research will support GLOBEC goals by providing the seasonal and interannual context for other concurrent studies, and by providing boundary conditions and data sets for model evaluation.  The field effort involves seven, 9-day interdisciplinary cruises/year in the northern GOA. The study area encompasses the 220-km long, Seward Line (sampled in the 1970s) that extends across the shelf and slope and high resolution sampling of the Alaska Coastal Current (ACC), upstream, downstream, and with-in Prince William Sound. The ACC is an important shelf habitat for YOY salmon migrating from nursery areas in the sound and into the GOA."

Through interactions with scientists working on these research projects and inquiry- and project-based investigations of their own, elementary and secondary students are using existing and new GLOBE protocols to monitor seasonal environmental changes that occur and increase their understanding of the Earth system.  Participating schools are being organized by biomes into eight regionally based Global Learning Communities (GLCs): Tundra, Taiga, Deciduous Forest, Grasslands, Rainforest, Desert, Shrub Land, and Savannah.  Students monitor their own biomes' seasons through regional based field campaigns, gaining new insights into the connections between climate variations and vegetation phenology.  Comparison of regional observations through an international phenology network established with this award reinforces student understanding of the causal relationships between abiotic and biotic components of the Earth system.  Existing GLOBE environmental monitoring protocols, including soil temperature, soil moisture, precipitation and phenology, are being adapted to be more biome specific. New freshwater ice and mosquito protocols for the Arctic and Tropical regions, respectively, will also be created during this award.  The project is initially focused on the Tundra and Taiga biomes because phonological changes are more pronounced in these regions.  In each subsequent year, two additional GLCs will be targeted, with organized field campaigns in these regions.  During field campaigns, students make daily measurements of cloud cover, air and soil temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture, using standardized GLOBE procedures.  In addition, seasonal, biome-specific vegetation phenology measurements will be taken using adapted GLOBE protocols and in situ ice (Tundra and Taiga) or mosquito (Rainforest) observations will be collected.  Throughout the year, students and teachers interact with project staff and partner scientists through web chats, audio conferences, and face-to-face training.  One international professional development workshop for teachers will be offered during each year of the project, at a location that corresponds to that year's targeted GLC.  During the workshops, standard-based content key concepts and skills in Earth system science and technology will be taught.  An annual Earth systems symposium will allow students to share the results of their investigations with other students and scientists.  As part of this project, students in Polar Regions will participate in the International Polar Year (IPY) through student-led field campaigns and web chats with IPY scientists.  In situ ice, mosquito, and vegetation measurements by students will provide more extensive ground validation for remotely sensed data collected by the satellite missions.  <br/>"

This project outlines a work plan that will go a long way to discriminating between uplift due to active tectonic processes and to deglaciation.   In this project several methods will be employed to obtain uplift histories.  These include stratigraphy, dendrochronology, and GPS measurements that will reoccupy tidal benchmarks. This proposal will provide the data base necessary to discriminate between glacial and tectonic deformation, and allow strain and deformation partitioning in this region of Alaska. If successful it will also provide a longer history of deformation and the earthquake cycle in Alaska which can be compared to other troubling quiet zones of Cascadia."

Their past, current, and future patterns of distribution in Arctic and Subarctic ecosystems are likely to be reflective of significant ecosystem change in temperature, water and nutrient cycling, as well as population dynamics of migratory animals such as caribou. Most of the data concerning current and historical distributions of Arctic lichens presently resides in the literature and within the natural history collections of North America, the two largest of which reside in the herbaria of the University of Alaska Museum (Fairbanks) and the University of Wisconsin State Herbarium (Madison). This project would identify, update nomenclature, barcode, georeference, and database this pair of collections. At the same time, an updated checklist of all Arctic & Subarctic lichen species will be generated, photographs will be collected, and taxonomic characters for each species will be coded for use in creating dynamic taxonomic keys and species descriptions. Together, this dataset will be integrated using the Symbiota software package to generate an online virtual Flora of Arctic Lichens. Virtual floras, with their interactive keys, color photographs, species descriptions, real-time distribution maps, and direct access to complete specimen metadata, represent a revolution in the way that biodiversity information is shared in a democratic manner with all who are interested. The creation of what promises to be a relatively comprehensive Flora will expose the discipline of lichenology to a larger community, and help to further advance an appreciation of ecological complexity within the Arctic biome. In addition to the online databases and information technology tools that will be generated, data gathered for this project will be disseminated through a series of regional and national workshops. The project will also serve as the basis for Arctic lichen-themed science camps, exhibits, lectures, and activities created for the greater public, including the K-12 student/teacher audience. Finally, the collaborative effort includes both undergraduate and graduate students who will receive training from a diverse team of researchers."

One issue that must be navigated in this changing landscape is the fate of the many synthetic organic chemicals that ultimately end up in the Arctic. Little is known about the fate of these chemicals once they reach the Artic, and any of these substances can harm organisms and people. The exposure risk of these compounds is tightly coupled to their environmental fate. This research will assess the abundance of these synthetic compounds and the ability of the Arctic environment to break down these substances. To support the education of future scientists on this emerging topic, a high school module will be delivered for the Alaska Summer Research Academy on Arctic environmental chemistry. Additionally, the research groups of Jennifer Guerard and Yu-Ping Chin will recruit a teacher for the Polar TREC (Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating) Program. If successful, this project will help direct contaminant mitigation efforts that will be required in the rapidly evolving Artic landscape. <br/><br/>Organic chemicals from industry and agriculture have been recently detected throughout the Arctic in the tundra, air, water, organisms, and people. However, little is known about the Artic fate of current use pesticides (CUPs) or emerging brominated flame retardants (EBFRs). This collaborative work between the University of Alaska Fairbanks and the University of Delaware seeks to understand how the Arctic's unique environment influences the fate and transformation of CUPs and EBFRs. Photolysis may play a critical role in the fate of these substances due to continuous solar irradiance in summer months coupled with the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM).  These factors can catalyze contaminant attenuation through reaction with photo-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) or other pathways. This project tests the hypotheses that: 1) Concentrations of CUPs and EBFRs in surface waters will be highest during and immediately following melt of snowpack; and  2) The formation of analyte-DOM complexes will render these substances more susceptible to photodegradation. The CUPs chlorpyrifos and chlorothalonil, and EBFRs 1,2-bis(2,4,6- tribromophenoxy)ethane and tetrabromobisphenol A, will be measured by atmospheric and aqueous sampling over two field seasons at Toolik Field Station. Partitioning to suspended solids, DOM, and phototransformation pathways influenced by Arctic DOM will be quantified through field and laboratory experiments. Critical measurements will be made of physical and biogeochemical parameters that can be incorporated into an Arctic-specific chemical fate model, including parameters for partitioning into environmental compartments and attenuation rates by photolytic pathways. A chemical fate model for CUPs and EBFRs in Arctic lakes will be developed to predict chemical behavior in Arctic waters under various physical and environmental conditions. Quantifying the persistence and transformation of these compounds will be indispensable for risk assessment and long-term policy development for Arctic region contaminants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research shows that engaging these students in STEM activities relevant to their everyday lives is critical to increasing their motivation, interest, learning, and participation in STEM. This project will address this need through engineering and computer science activities aimed at helping 400 middle and high school students grasp the intricacies of scientific principles and technology design. The goal is to inspire and prepare a greater number of students from the targeted population to understand how these principles and design strategies contribute to a stronger educational and technological society. To do this, the project will use a teaching and learning model that will integrate human-centered robotics and telepresence theme-based activities in a problem-based learning and systems thinking environment. In this project, human-centered robotics will involve the development of robotics technologies and applications for everyday use while telepresence robots will enable better communication, operation, and exploration across enormous distances. This dual strategy makes the proposed technological approach highly relevant to the daily needs of students in Alaska.<br/><br/>The project will be conducted by an interdisciplinary team of students and faculty mentors from the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Departments at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks and from the School of Informatics and Computing and the Center for Research on Learning and Technology at Indiana University at Bloomington. Through this partner-effort, the research team will develop a curriculum that addresses the technical and societal aspects of the human-centered robotics and telepresence that underlie the engineering and computer science concepts students will learn about. Each year, students will actively engage in a 9-month problem-based learning strategy using two basic open-architecture platforms based on the Arduino microcontroller. Students will be able to customize these platforms through design variations and with the addition of new sensors, actuators, program parts, and other technology-related functions. User-friendly software will help teachers and mentors assist students with their designs and redesigns. Through this approach, students will gain STEM knowledge and skills that will be useful to their own individual lives and for sharing with other students, who might be chronically ill, reside in remote places, live in the lower 48 states, or even internationally via ties established through prior NSF-supported efforts. Hence, this project will help student develop technology-based products adaptable to peoples' daily environments, needs, and practices in some meaningful way, which in turn, could increase student's motivation and interest in STEM and STEM careers."

Another popular method for evaluating injury risk for manual material handling is to measure the lumbar spine stress for back pain. However, these methods are all static and cannot accurately reflect dynamic motion generation and injury prevention. Using biomechanical models provides relatively new, alternative techniques that allow direct testing and individualized results. In this collaborative project, the PIs will develop a predictive lumbar spine musculoskeletal model for a dynamic manual material handling. The project aims to develop an efficient tool for injury risk assessment and prediction in dynamic lifting process.  Project results will have potentially wide application in manual material handling ergonomics and will further advance lifting biomechanics. The project includes education opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students. A two-week summer workshop will be offered to underserved minority middle and high school students at University of Alaska Fairbanks in collaboration with the Alaska Summer Research Academy. Another week-long summer workshop will be offered to local workers with lifting jobs and Hispanic middle school students at Texas Tech University.<br/><br/>The project focuses on developing an inverse dynamics optimization-based (predictive dynamics) method for dynamic manual material handling using a musculoskeletal model with dynamic strength data.  Dynamic strength data will be developed for key joints, such as the knee, hip, ankle, elbow and lower spine. The tool developed for predicting injury events in dynamic lifting systems will advance the current offline procedure to an online, near real-time optimal motion control and injury prevention system. Injury is defined in two ways: by measuring lumbar spine compression and shear stresses using a musculoskeletal model, and, in joint space, by measuring the percentage of joint torque for key joints to predict injury. Specific objectives are to: 1) derive a general dynamic strength model and validate the model parameters from experiments; 2) introduce and experimentally validate a lumbar spine muscle model; and 3) implement these models with a nonlinear programming algorithm to optimize the dynamic lifting motion during manual material handling for minimum injury and experimentally demonstrate proof-of-concept. Muscle intra/inter-joint coupling will be modeled and the lumbar spine area will be added, thereby generating a musculoskeletal model to measure lumbar stresses for back pain in the dynamic lifting process. The dynamic strength parameters in joint space estimated from active human subjects will provide the model with improved accuracy and efficient calculations that can be used to evaluate injury for complex non-periodic functional tasks that may not be experimentally verifiable by traditional means. The model, which enables near real-time calculations of dynamic manual material handling as a function of time, can be used to establish an individual-specific dynamic limiting lifting process, as well as optimal strategy for lifting. Project results will serve as new guidelines for manual material handling ergonomic design, considering dynamic effects. In addition, better understanding of various constraints in optimization formulation inherent in the human physiological system, as well as motion adaptation to these constraints, will contribute to the field of human locomotion study and complement existing design principles for manual material handling."

They are an important component of the ecosystem as secondary consumers, they serve as high-quality prey for many marine mammals and birds, and in Prince William Sound, Alaska, they comprise an important seasonal commercial fishery.<br/><br/>Models to estimate fish populations commonly integrate many variables, including age, length, sex composition, fishing mortality, and indices of abundance such as catch per unit effort and survey biomass.  For Pacific herring in Prince William Sound, population biomass has been modeled and estimated since the early 1970s.  Natural mortality is usually treated as a constant in these models because it is difficult to estimate mortality without comprehensive information about disease and predation.  Recent evidence from Prince William Sound, however, indicates that use of a constant mortality in such models can lead to large errors in stock assessment estimates.  In 1993, estimates based on age-structured population models led biologists to predict that over 1 00,000 metric tons of Pacific herring would spawn.  However, only 20,000 metric tons actually returned to spawn.  When viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus was isolated from several herring sampled from the population, it was hypothesized that a disease epidemic was responsible for the unexpectedly large natural mortality.<br/><br/>This project will evaluate the role of disease in Pacific herring by focusing on two specific objectives: 1) to determine prevalence and severity of disease in a free ranging Pacific herring population; and 2) to determine, through modifications of an age-structured assessment model, the contribution of disease in explaining Pacific herring population fluctuations.  To assess disease-produced mortality, adult Pacific herring from Prince William Sound will be sampled each year in April and October.  These will be examined to determine standard length and a variety of assays for general physiological condition  and the presence of pathogens will be performed. Prevalence of potential pathogens will be statistically linked to histopathologic lesions and changes in blood chemistry to determine significance of disease to individuals, and prevalence will be linked to population models of abundance to determine population-level significance.<br/><br/>Disease is a fundamental biological process that ultimately affects the longevity of most individuals, and any process that affects individuals will also impact populations.  This study will investigate the ecological significance of disease in a pelagic marine schooling fish species and will be the first to model the link between enzootic disease and population change.  Results from this study will answer basic questions about how season, gender, spawning condition, and age may affect disease processes cycling through a population.<br/><br/><br/>"

Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) are found in a number of diverse organisms including fish, insects, spiders, mites, plant, and bacteria. While there is tremendous structural variation among these AFPs they all appear to lower the freezing point of water by a similar non-colligative mechanism. However, the insect AFPs are, by far, the most active, generally functioning to prevent freezing in freeze susceptible insects by inhibiting ice nucleating agents and innoculative freezing across the cuticle.  However, a few AFP-producing insects are freeze tolerant and the function of AFPs in these is unknown. Two insect AFPs have been characterized. One type has been described from two species of beetles, but there is variation in sequence, etc., both within and between the species.  Until recent research identified 18 species with AFPs, these proteins had not been reported in Alaskan or arctic insects. Certain of these have been chosen for further study, presenting the opportunity to extend understanding of insect AFPs to extremely cold tolerant species, and in the case of the beetle Cucujus clavipes ,to compare populations from arctic Alaska to those from Indiana. The mean winter supercooling point of Alaskan Cucujus larvae are -42oC, with some individuals supercooling to -57oC, while that of Indiana larvae is -24oC. AFP activity in Alaskan Cucujus is, by far, the highest ever described, even though the AFPs are similar to those of other beetles. Understanding the structure/function relationships of the Cucujus AFPs, and the enhancers (other proteins and polyols) which increase their activity, is of prime concern. In addition to AFPs, a suite of other overwintering adaptations (extreme dehydration to 1/3 normal body water, multimolar glycerol concentrations, diapause) contribute to the low supercooling points of Alaskan Cucujus. These are being studied, and using microarray technology and other means to monitor molecular markers, the Principal Investigators will attempt to understand the integration of these adaptations. Additional investigations involve the structure/function relationships of three other Alaskan beetle AFPs, and that of the insect  type of AFP. Two of the beetle species are freeze tolerant and this is the first study of AFPs from freeze tolerant insects.  The Principal Investigators will continue to screen additional species for the presence of AFPs (to identify interesting candidates for future study), and to monitor microhabitat temperatures and overwintering mortality of select species.  The broader impact of this study concerns its effects on 1) biological education and 2) applications of AFPs in science and technology.  Post-docs, PhD and undergraduate students, and high school teachers will work on this project.  The Principal Investigators believe that the integrated training (in modern molecular techniques such as microarray, field biology, physiology of cold tolerance, protein biochemistry, etc.) at they will receive provides critical preparation for success in today's highly<br/>integrative and changing research environment. This will provide a direct benefit to teaching in biology. In addition to research papers, the Principal Investigators will incorporate these studies in review articles, symposium presentations.  Also, as they are the most active AFPs known, insect AFPs (especially from Alaskan beetles) have tremendous potential for applied studies. For example, they have generated transgenic plants producing insect AFPs which lower the plant freezing temperature. Similar work using Alaskan beetle AFPs should be even more productive.<br/><br/><br/>"

Its degradation is impacting northern landscapes and societies. With an increase in the number of remote sensing platforms since the early 2000s, the ability to detect and measure permafrost-region disturbances over large areas has become more feasible. This research, a project we call PermaSense, will provide funding to increase the research capacity of a non-tenure track Research Assistant Faculty member and an early career post-doctoral researcher through extended visits, training, and collaboration at the University of Connecticut (UConn) Department of Natural Resources & the Environment (DNRE). PermaSense will allow the PI and postdoc to build upon their permafrost-region field and remote sensing research program by acquiring new data fusion and machine learning techniques. PermaSense products are directly relevant to the State of Alaska and the nation. The skills and knowledge transfer gained during this project will increase the capacity of permafrost research and remote sensing at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The research addresses several of the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC) performance elements related to permafrost, terrestrial ecosystems, coastal resilience, and environmental intelligence as specified in the FY2017-2021 Arctic Research Plan.<br/><br/>Permafrost is defined as ground that remains at or below 0 degrees Celsius for at least two consecutive years. Disturbance and warming of near-surface permafrost may lead to widespread terrain instability in ice-rich permafrost regions, impacting ecosystems, hydrology, infrastructure, society, and soil-carbon dynamics. Remote sensing is an important resource for observing, documenting, and better understanding landscape change from local to pan-Arctic scales. However, no one remote sensing tool is particularly suited for detecting and observing the suite of landscape change scenarios associated with transitioning permafrost. PermaSense will investigate myriad land surface changes occurring in permafrost regions using multidimensional remote sensing, data fusion, and machine learning techniques. PermaSense will enhance methodological developments and adaptations to unseal faster, deeper and more accurately analyze large volumes of multidimensional remote-sensing data to address the guiding research question: How extensive is contemporary permafrost degradation in the Arctic and Subarctic? We will conduct an analysis of multidimensional remote sensing observations at four representative permafrost-region study areas that capture the variability in the lateral extent of permafrost. The inherent differences in ecology, climate, landscape history, and their role in transitioning permafrost regions will be tested using common approaches across all sites as well as value-added products available for particular regions. PermaSense will develop an online resource and toolset that will provide spatially and temporally scalable information on permafrost region disturbances and a tool for local planning activities, the scientific community, and regional decision-makers tasked with responding to permafrost regions in transition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Used along with old maps, these permit changes in surface elevation and volume to be calculated for different time intervals. This is a twoyear follow-up study to complete data processing and archiving, and to perform several interpretative tasks. The first of these tasks will be to improve techniques for extrapolating the changes on measured glaciers to obtain the volume changes of unmeasured ones. This will require the compilation of a regional map of late summer snowlines to help define climate regions.  The second interpretative task involves removing the effects of glacier flow from the data, so that the changes can be related to climate alone. The final task is to interpret these corrected changes in<br/>terms of local and regional climate, and to predict what will happen to the glaciers in the future under specified climate scenarios.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The research will be carried out from a scientific perspective, but there are several applications. The most obvious is the refined determination of how much the glaciers of Alaska have contributed to the rise in sea level, and what future contributions are likely to be under various climate scenarios. The recent contribution has been much larger than originally predicted, and may exceed that from the major ice sheets. A recent paper describing these results attracted worldwide press attention.

As with cabled observatories envisioned elsewhere, this is an unprecedented opportunity for continuous, real-time access to the water column, the underside of sea ice and ocean bottom sediments.<br/><br/>Planning for this facility has been proceeding for the past year, but the emphasis has been nearly solely on the physical facility (i.e., the building).  Without dedicated planning to the science infrastructure being done soon, it is possible that the best opportunity to undertake the best science in this venue may be unrealized.<br/><br/>The methodology will be to first hold a workshop in Barrow, bringing together oceanographers,<br/>seismologists, biologists, sea ice specialists, oil industry representatives and educators.  The focus will be a discussion of what instrumentation would be necessary to study the Beaufort Shelf and adjacent waters.  The resulting report will form the basis for engineering studies that would include preliminary plans for implementation.  These plans would concentrate on adaptation of technology being developed for other seafloor observatories and how to exploit devices routinely deployed on moorings.  A second meeting would result in an engineering report, translating the original science plan into a series of technical requirements for an Arctic seafloor installation.<br/><br/>It should be noted in the area of ""Broader Impacts"" that this effort has been extensively coordinated with key constituencies of the Barrow community, and is endorsed by leaders of that community.<br/><br/>The three separate SGER proposals are:<br/>0438100 Chayes, Dale  Columbia University<br/>0438102 Proshutinsky, Andrey Wood Hole Oceanographic Institution<br/>  Chave, Alan<br/>  Detrick, Robert<br/>0439107 Coakley, Bernard University of Alaska Fairbanks    <br/>  Weingartner, Thomas<br/><br/>This combination of talents is both necessary and sufficient to complete the tasks as proposed.<br/><br/>"

The Division of Ocean Sciences will contribute funding for future site selection surveys in the Arctic Ocean.  Over the past few years, the Arctic Ocean has been revealed through the acquisition of new data by airplanes, icebreakers, and submarines. These data have been compiled into publicly available grids of bathymetry, gravity, and magnetic data that provide a basic regional description. This enormous international investment stems from the wide recognition that fundamental problems in the Earth Sciences, from paleoclimate and paleoceanographic issues to basic plate tectonics can be answered there.  To unravel the region's history and gain a deeper understanding of the Arctic Ocean's evolution, it is necessary to image ridge structures and the accumulated Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments with multi-channel seismic reflection data (MCS) and the deeper crust with seismic refraction data.  <br/>Intellectual Merit - This project presents a program of high resolution MCS and seismic refraction data acquisition to be conducted along a transect across the Arctic basin during the summer of 2005 on the Healy with an Arctic adapted MCS system (200-300 meter streamer) and sonobuoys starting from Point Barrow, Alaska and ending near Svalbard, Norway. The transect will cross the Chukchi Borderland, the Nautilus Basin, the Mendeleev Ridge, the Alpha Ridge, the Makarov Basin, the Lomonosov Ridge, and the Gakkel Ridge. These new data will determine the internal structure of the ridges and plateaus that subdivide the basin, and will establish for the first time the stratigraphy of the intervening basins. Knowledge of this structure is required to test hypotheses regarding the of the basin and ridge history and the type and location of plate boundaries in the Amerasian Basin. The objectives go beyond a local understanding of the Arctic and bear directly on understanding the global plate tectonic circuit for the Mesozoic.<br/>National and International Cooperation - A group of U.S, Swedish, and Norwegian investigators will make major a cross-Arctic basin expedition in the summer, 2005. The Swedish icebreaker Oden will transit the basin, reproducing an oceanographic section collected in 1994. The USCG Healy will support solid earth and coring applications and will operate autonomously for about half of the expedition, meeting with Oden on the flanks of the Alpha Ridge to transit in tandem out of the basin. The project will receive substantial funding from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate.  During the combined programs, Healy will collect an unprecedented, integrated geophysical data set consisting of multi-beam swath bathymetry and sidescan, sub-bottom profiler, multi-channel seismic reflection and seismic refraction data.<br/>Broader Impacts - The focus of this research will be on the structure and stratigraphy of the Arctic Ocean, but the data will have uses beyond the work because an integrated data set collected from Healy will be the beginning of a site survey database for the Arctic Ocean. Thus, the first dedicated scientific drilling in the Arctic will take place on the Lomonosov Ridge during the summer of 2004. Collection of these new data will build on the efforts planned next summer, prepare for future scientific drilling operations in the Arctic Ocean and substantially increase international cooperation in Arctic Research. A number of students from both the US and Europe will participate in this cruise. <br/><br/>"

Oxidation by nitrates, profiles of methane using near-IR CRDS and photochemistry of organic nitrates are the topics of interest.  The PI has a joint appointment at the Geophysical Institute and the Chemistry Department at the University of Alaska.   <br/><br/>Instrument development for ultrasensitive atmospheric measurements is needed as our understanding of the atmosphere is refined.  This information is required for accurate modeling and prediction of global climate changes.  Methods such as cavity ring down spectroscopy, developed within the physical chemistry program, should be exploited to the maximum extent possible for these applications.   However, further work is needed to understand the limits of these methods in terms of spectral congestion, interferences, etc.   Professor Simpson's educational efforts include outreach to Native American students in the Fairbanks area.

This involves the use of plant sugars to support bacteria that capture atmospheric nitrogen gas into the roots of the plant, as well as to support fungi that take up soil phosphorus and also move it into the roots.  This study proposes that coordinated changes in host selection for both partners by the tree, red alder, enables persistence of this nitrogen-fixing species as interior Alaskan forests develop over time after disturbances such as fire, and regulates the overall nitrogen inputs to these forests.  The identity and physiology of the bacterial and fungal partners will be measured over an age sequence of forest stands. Then shifts in the microbial partners in stands that have been fertilized will be documented and used to help design partner choices for a set of experiments in a greenhouse.  Physiological consequences of these shifts for nitrogen as measured in the greenhouse will be scaled back to the ecosystem using measurements of the mass of root nodules in combination with seasonal patterns of measured nitrogen fixation.  <br/><br/>This project will be the first to study the influence of mutualist partner choice on nitrogen fixation inputs at the ecosystem scale.  Understanding controls over nitrogen fixation by native and invasive plants is a problem of fundamental scientific value in Alaska, where invasive nitrogen fixing trees are beginning to appear, and where the range of alders has expanded substantially across the boreal/tundra boundary over the past 150 years. The project has strong ties to the Bonanza Creek Long-term Ecological Research program, where education and public outreach activities will include components of this study.  This project will also result in the training of one post-doctoral fellow, two graduate students, and six undergraduates in state-of-the art field, molecular and bioinformatics methods. <br/>"

Currently, the only well-accepted hypothesis for the evolution and maintenance of EFNs is that they lure predatory arthropods, especially ants, onto plant tissues and thereby reduce the damage caused by herbivores. Evidence supporting this explanation for EFNs is mixed, however. The goal of this study is to test an alternative hypothesis, the nutrition hypothesis, for the evolution and maintenance of the trait. In the North American shrub, Acacia constricta, EFNs appear to encourage ants to nest within the rooting zone of the plant, where ants can enhance soil mineral nutrient concentrations and may increase plant fitness. Some acacia individuals have ant nests at the base and others do not. Nests under acacia are dynamic, forming anew each summer. Previous work at the study site has demonstrated that ant nest soils are enriched in nutrients that frequently limit plant reproduction. The proposed research uses field and laboratory experiments to test the relative importance of nutrition and protection to correlates of fitness for A. constricta. The research also tests whether enhanced plant nutrition, provided by ant nests, feeds back to the ants through the production of high-quality food rewards. Results from this research will contribute important insights to a model system used in the evolutionary ecology of plant-herbivore interactions. The project also will contribute more generally to the role that ants play in nutrient distribution and accumulation in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. The project will provide training for a Ph.D. student and several undergraduates in the laboratory and greenhouse (University of Alaska Fairbanks) and in the field (Southwestern Research Station, Arizona). Special effort will be made to recruit native and rural undergraduates who have never had the opportunity to travel outside the state of Alaska. The project will broaden the view of ecology students by introducing them to a new biome with high biodiversity, structured by climatic challenges unlike those of their home state."

Specifically, the dynamical and neutral-plasma coupling in the middle and upper atmosphere would be investigated with a new resonance lidar at Poker Flat Research Range (PFRR), Chatanika, Alaska, that is a sodium resonance wind-temperature lidar (W&T) system that was recently relocated to PFRR and made operational with observations starting in January 2018. The operations of this instrument would acquire wind and temperature profiles through the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region of 80-110 km that would be coordinated with the on-going operations of six key instruments at PFRR: namely, the volume imaging sodium lidar, the Poker Flat Rayleigh density-temperature lidar, the Poker Flat metal resonance density lidar, a three-channel all sky imager, the Poker Flat Meteor Wind Radar, and the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar. The research would have a variety of broader impacts addressing fundamental processes in fluid dynamics, aerosol and plasma science while developing new remote sensing technology. The W&T resonance lidar will be operated at the Lidar Research Laboratory at PFRR, and would support the participation of two UAF graduate students as well as visiting students in scientific investigations and engineering projects. The W&T lidar system operations would enhance the Poker Flat Rocket Range research infrastructure, extending the cluster of ground-based suite of instruments at PFRR that would in turn allow new rocket-based investigations at PFRR. The activity will advance integration of satellite and ground-based measurements and inter-comparison, calibration, and validation of remote sensing techniques. The observations, analyses and results of this activity will contribute to national and international programs, including the CAWSES, CEDAR, SEARCH, and SPARC programs. The results of the activity will be disseminated widely through both professional and public outreach programs associated with UAF and NASA. <br/><br/>The Arctic atmosphere can be considered as a unique laboratory for investigating atmospheric coupling and understanding how terrestrial meteorology forcing (from below) and space weather activity (from above) combine to determine the overall structure and circulation of the middle and upper atmosphere. The W&T instrument would acquire measurements of sufficient accuracy and precision to allow comparative studies of temperature and wind over daily, seasonal, and yearly time scales. These measurements would provide excellent data supporting studies relating to dynamic coupling, ion-neutral coupling, and aerosol-plasma coupling. The program of lidar measurements would address these topics through observations of specific phenomena: gravity waves, tides, planetary waves, instabilities, mesospheric inversion layers, mesospheric metal layers, extended thermospheric metal layers, sporadic layers, Joule heating, ion drag, ion composition, and noctilucent clouds. The overarching aim of the series of observations would be to achieve a coherent framework for understanding these interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Identifying breathing-related, CO2-sensitive neurons in the central nervous system and characterizing their location, development, phenotype, function, and plasticity will be a major advance in basic understanding of breathing and its neural control. Dr Taylor's research will identify neurons and mechanisms that underlie CO2 sensitivity by investigating a developing neural circuit that controls breathing. Her research will elucidate development of CO2-induced respiratory drive in an organism whose transition from aquatic to terrestrial life may reflect evolutionary changes common to vertebrates, including humans. The frog is an ideal research model organism because its isolated brainstem provides, at any stage of development, the intact and functional brainstem circuit that controls breathing, and it allows long-term investigation of central respiratory CO2 responses under normal physiological conditions. No other vertebrate model offers this suite of advantages. Dr Taylor's research will transform current thinking about developmental change in central CO2 sensitivity, emphasizing that it is not a predetermined neurodevelopment but a dynamic, and potentially harnessable, neuroplasticity. This provocative line of research will characterize the development and plasticity of respiratory drive.  The intellectual merit of this project is the identification of specific, multiple mechanisms of CO2 sensitivity in the brainstem.

This award will be jointly supported by the Arctic Natural Sciences Program and Geology and Paleontology Program in the Division of Earth Sciences.  Glaciers produce large amounts of fine-grained sediment, exposing vast amounts of mineral surface area to chemical weathering processes. Despite the tremendous potential for glaciers to influence global weathering rates and hence atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, this effect has not yet been demonstrated. Silicate weathering rates underneath glaciers are subdued, and rates in recently deglaciated terrain are below average. The hypothesis is that loess weathering provides the key link between the physical erosion done by glaciers and global geochemical cycles. This project is to study silicate weathering fluxes from glacial loess, and assess their global significance. Loess is a silt-clay sized sediment, transported by wind off unvegetated braid plains of glacier-fed rivers, and deposited over broad vegetated areas. Both the fine grain size and vegetation should render loess deposits highly susceptible to silicate weathering. These deposits effectively extend the impact of glaciation to a much broader area than the extent of glacier ice. Weathering of loess has never been examined from the perspective of contribution to global geochemical cycles.  The project is designed to answer two questions: 1) does loess deposition increase the silicate weathering flux from a soil profile, and 2) does the weathering of loess occur at rates that can affect global weathering rates, and hence, global CO2 levels? Laboratory experiments, field measurements, and modeling will be used to address these questions. The field site is the Delta River valley in central Alaska, a glacial outwash system with on-going loess deposition at variable rates. Results from lab and fieldwork will be synthesized in a one-dimensional model of soil weathering fluxes as a function of loess deposition rate, precipitation rate, organic matter content, and grain size distributions. The model will be extended to the landscape scale to assess the global significance of loess deposition on CO2 consumption.  Weathering of loess may be a significant, but it is still an unrecognized, component of carbon cycling.  If this proves to be the case, then loess formation and weathering over timescales much longer than the duration of glaciation must be considered in models of atmospheric CO2 variation.<br/>"

Icefishes are the only vertebrates that as adults, lack the circulating oxygen-binding protein hemoglobin (Hb); several species within this family also lack the intracellular oxygen-binding protein myoglobin (Mb) in their heart ventricle. The loss of Hb and Mb has resulted in striking modifications in the cardiovascular system to ensure adequate tissue oxygenation, some of which are energetically costly. Recent indicate there may be at least one benefit to not expressing these heme-centered proteins - oxidized proteins and lipids are higher in red-blooded notothenioids compared to icefishes. The research will address the hypothesis that the loss of Hb and Mb reduces oxidative stress in icefishes compared to red-blooded notothenioid fishes, resulting in a lower rate of protein turnover and energetic cost savings. Specifically, the project will (1)  Characterize levels of oxidative stress in red- and white-blooded notothenioid fishes, (2) Determine if red- and white-blooded notothenioids differ in their regulation of iron, (3) Determine if lower levels of oxidized proteins in icefishes result in lower rates of protein turnover and energetic cost savings, and (4) Determine if oxygen-binding proteins promote oxidative stress in-vivo and in-vitro.<br/><br/>The results will contribute to the understanding of iron-catalyzed oxidative stress, which is associated with the progression of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, the research will increase understanding of factors related to iron metabolism and oxidative stress in notothenioid fishes that may have played key roles in the success of channichthyid icefishes. The broader impacts include development of a website will enable teachers and students to learn more about the fascinating biology of Antarctic icefishes, as well as the impacts of global climate change and commercial fishing activities on Antarctic fishes. Additionally, Alaska Native high school and undergraduate students will be involved in research at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks."

Chemistry faculty at these sites, which include UA campuses at Fairbanks, Anchorage, Juneau, and the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, do have some experience using molecular modeling software. However, most of these small chemistry departments by themselves lack experience using molecular modeling in the teaching setting, they lack colleagues within their sub-disciplines to discuss specific molecular modeling issues, and they lack the financial resources and technical background to install the necessary hardware and software on a department-wide scale. Thus the UA consortium was formed to provide mutual technical support concerning how to solve specific molecular modeling problems, to exchange ideas and methods for incorporating molecular modeling in the chemistry curriculum, and to choose the best hardware and software for installation in undergraduate computer labs. The PIs settled on a common hardware standard and the HyperChem molecular modeling system to facilitate communication throughout the UA system. Communication also is fostered by setting up a Web site (www.hyperalaska.edu) as a centralized information exchange site for Alaska chemistry faculty, or others nationwide, regarding teaching or research applications of molecular modeling. UA chemistry faculty are adapting molecular modeling methods in their curricula in various ways. These are designed to: (1) enhance the mental picture of molecularity among introductory level students (Jones, ChemConf 96), (2) create unifying cross-disciplinary connections among upper division students enrolled in discipline-specific chemistry and (in some cases) biology classes (Martin, J. Chem. Ed., 75, 241, 1998), and (3) critically benchmark computational chemistry results against experimental results, such as those obtained in NMR, IR, thermochemical, chromatographic, kinetic or other experiments (Yarger, J. Chem. Ed., 74, 243, 1997; Wolfson, J. Chem. Ed. 73, 1026, 1996). The across-the-board implementation of molecular modeling described here is expected to significantly strengthen chemistry learning by providing new motivation for students to undertake learning, a new conceptual route to learning, and significant and interesting learning goals for both students and teachers.<br/>"

This award would deploy to the Poker Flat rocket range located near Fairbanks, Alaska, a state-of-the-art meteor radar system that would make middle atmosphere wind measurements with good height resolution (1-2 km) and good temporal resolution (30 to 60 min). The application of this instrument is to study the dynamics of the Arctic MLT region continually day and night. These new wind observations would be integrated into a study that combines radar and lidar measurements, satellite measurements, and meteorological re-analyses, to understand the wave-driven circulation of the Arctic polar atmosphere. The satellite observations and meteorological re-analyses yield synoptic-scale measurements of the mesosphere, stratosphere and troposphere.  The lidar observations yield high-resolution height profile temperature and density measurements that allow characterization of the existing planetary waves, tides, and gravity waves. The new radar would yield accurate MLT wind measurements that complete the characterization of these waves and would support modeling efforts aimed at improving the understanding of the wave-driven global circulation. The investigators would use or re-analyze the MERRA (lower atmosphere below 80 km) and SABER profile data (to cover higher altitudes for the range of 90 to 110 km) to characterize the synoptic stratospheric and lower mesospheric activities. The radar observations would help to understand the extent to which nitrogen compounds produced by energetic particle precipitation in the thermosphere contribute to the composition of the lower atmosphere by transport across the MLT region into the stratosphere and the ozone layer. The activity in this new award will support the education and training of students in science and engineering. The award would extend research infrastructure in the Arctic, especially at the Poker Flat Rocket Range, enhance international and national collaborations, and promote collaboration among observers and modelers. The research results will be integrated into the University of Alaska programs and disseminated through a variety of professional, educational, and outreach programs.<br/><br/>Analyses based on temperature and pressure measurements and gradient winds are used to describe planetary wave activity in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere, and the circulation follows well-defined synoptic patterns of cyclones and anti-cyclones. However, direct wind measurements are increasingly important at higher altitudes where the amplitudes of shorter-period waves and tides are the largest component of the winds. The activity would provide new observations as well as a coherent framework for understanding these interactions."

With the Arctic ice pack undergoing a major transition from perennial to seasonal ice, ice thickness - more so than ice extent - is a key variable  describing the state and evolution of the ice-ocean system. However, methods of observing sea ice thickness at regional or basin scales with sufficient accuracy and resolution to capture growth and melt processes, detect hazards, or assess habitat quality are lacking. This project will develop an Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) snow radar system capable of being integrated into long-range Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). This will allow acquisition of basin-scale ice thickness and snow depth data as part of a network for Arctic observations that addresses information needs of researchers, local communities and industry. This MRI development project will contribute to NSF's Navigating the New Arctic Big Idea. <br/><br/>AEM methods offer a novel means of measuring sea ice thickness over the full range of thicknesses found in the Polar Regions. By remotely sensing the positions of the upper and lower surfaces of the ice cover, AEM measurements typically achieve an accuracy of better than 10% of the total thickness, with less sensitivity to uncertainties in snow cover or sea surface topography. Development and commissioning of the Long-range Airborne Snow and Sea Ice Thickness Observing System (LASSITOS) will also provide opportunities for education and training, including capstone projects for the University of Alaska Fairbanks' new minor in aeronautical engineering and student involvement in comprehensive calibration/validation field activities. LASSITOS is expected to generate interest among native students from coastal villages in northern Alaska, who represent another key stakeholder group for sea ice information.

It builds on 50 years of informal education and outreach at the Alaskan Permafrost Tunnel near Fairbanks, AK, which, since the 1960s, has been the Nation's only underground facility for research related to permafrost and climate.  The project has four components: (1) a nationally distributed 2,000 square-foot traveling exhibition; (2) exhibit and program enhancements to the learning opportunities at the tunnel; (3) programs, table-top exhibits and oral history research in 27 Native Alaskan villages; and (4) an education research study.  Each of these components will be evaluated over the course of the work.  By upgrading the displays at the tunnel, and by taking traveling programs to the villages, the work will extend the tunnel experience across Alaska.  In the villages the team will collect stories about climate change, along with samples of real ancient ice and permafrost.  These stories and materials will be used in the travelling exhibit which is expected to be at three museums per year for eight years.  <br/><br/>The research component of the initiative will build on the observation to date that the tunnel has provided thousands of visitors with an underground immersive environment where they learn about the science research being conducted and engage with climate-sensitive materials (e.g., permafrost, wedge ice, frozen silt, Pleistocene bones) using all of their senses.  It has been conjectured that their learning experiences are enhanced by interacting with real vs. replicated objects.   As museums often contain exhibits that are more likely to contain replicated and/or virtual objects and environments, understanding the impact that these different categories of objects have on learning is important. Using both types of materials, the project will investigate differences in their efficacy in informal science learning institutions related to climate change.  Real objects are postulated to have the following attributes that stimulate fuller engagement; they are (1) information-rich by virtue of such features as their texture, odor, and dimensionality; (2) at real-life scale; (3) authentic, i.e., original objects; and (4) often unique, i.e., have inherent value.  Research questions will explore the potential impacts on learning of these and related features.  Methods employed will be observation, video, and interviews of the public with a particular focus on visitor talk with respect to explanations and elaborations about permafrost, tipping points, climate change, and geological time."

This ecosystem is located in the zone of discontinuous permafrost and has two primary ecosystem types: permafrost free, deciduous dominated and permafrost affected, coniferous dominated. This study will integrate climatic, ecologic, thermal, and hydrologic processes through an intense field study program using hydrologic modeling. The field site comprises three catchments that represent a gradient of varying permafrost extent and ecosystem-type composition at the Caribou Poker Creeks Research Watershed (CPCRW) Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site. In addition to stream flow observations, measurements of plant water use, soil moisture, seasonal soil thaw, and meteorologic variables will be collected along a north-facing (permafrost affected) coniferous dominated ecosystem to a south-facing (permafrost free) deciduous dominated ecosystem. Data from the field study will be used to develop and parameterize a vegetation water use model, which in turn will be integrated into a hybrid hydrologic model. Development of this semi-distributed, process-based hybrid hydrologic model will simulate the major hydrologic processes of the boreal forest ecosystem, emphasizing the water storage and release mechanisms.  <br/><br/>The boreal forest is a critical source of Alaska?s freshwater. This study will contribute to improved understanding and prediction of freshwater availability that will be affected by changes in permafrost and ecosystem distributions in the boreal forest. This study will also advance the field of ecohydrology, which is relatively under-explored in northern systems. The sub-Arctic environment will be the first in the Arctic to experience most of the current or expected climate-associated changes. Such changes have the potential to shift the magnitude and timing of freshwater delivery to the Arctic Ocean which is anticipated to lead to changes in sea-ice formation, thermohaline circulation, and ultimately the climate system from local to global scales.  Outreach is an important aspect of this study. Teachers from local K-12 schools will participate in training workshops focused on the boreal forest ecosystem that will be conducted in conjunction with the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment program (GLOBE) program at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Prior experience shows that the approach that will be used in this project is an effective means to integrate the natural science of the region into local classrooms."

Three factors have led to the scientific neglect of this region: (1) small population and value of assets at risk; (2) politically mandated restrictions on travel; and (3) the challenging conditions of distance and weather.  The first situation has been reversed by the rapid growth of international air traffic between Asia and North America and its vulnerability to volcanic ash, and the second by the end of the Cold War.  Accordingly, it is time for scientists to join together and conquer the third factor.

While probabilistic and combinatorial methods have been applied successfully in this field of biology, the tools of algebraic geometry yield new insight and help researchers to gain a better understanding of many of the underlying mathematical issues.  The goals of this project are to develop new algorithms for the search of tree space, develop a new statistical measure of support for local features in a phylogenetic tree, and to develop, formalize, and study new mathematical models of sequence evolution.  Improving phylogenetic methods by speeding up heuristic searches of tree space will have significant value in practical phylogenetics, allowing the investigation of phylogenetic relationships for larger data sets and for increased thoroughness in the search of tree space.  The work will be carried out at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and involves researchers with connections to the Institute of Arctic Biology.<br/><br/>Phylogenetic inference from sequence data is used widely throughout the biological sciences, and improvements in methods and theoretical understanding will have a far-reaching impact.  As phylogenetic data sets become larger and biological explanations of the evolutionary process at the sequence level improve, understanding the more complicated models describing the processes at work is necessary for developing valid and effective methods of statistical inference.  This work develops emerging connections between the areas of algebraic geometry and mathematical biology and brings about significant broader impacts ranging from the interdisciplinary training of students and software dissemination to collaborations with researchers outside of Alaska."

In polar regions, however, photoperiod exhibits extreme annual variation culminating with the sun remaining above or below the horizon for extended periods. Without a defined LD cycle, some arctic residents lose daily organization of behavior and physiology, and it has been hypothesized that the molecular clockwork that drives circadian rhythms may be weak or absent in arctic vertebrates. This study tests the hypothesis that persistence of circadian organization in some arctic mammals is adaptive because it allows organisms to minimize thermoregulatory costs. Specifically, the investigators will examine persistence, entrainment, and function of circadian rhythms in the arctic ground squirrel (AGS) during the continuous daylight of the active season and the continuous dark of hibernation. Four research objectives span from molecular and neurobiological mechanisms to physiological, behavioral and ecological adaptation: (1) determine when circadian rhythms are exhibited during the annual cycle of free-living AGS and establish if the onset of rhythmicity in spring coincides with first exposure to light, (2) determine if circadian rhythms persist in the master clock of AGS during hibernation by measuring patterns of clock gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the brain, (3) determine if AGS entrain circadian rhythms to daily changes in light quality or intensity, and (4) investigate patterns of re-entrainment and the function of rhythms in the arctic summer by experimentally phase-shifting free-living ground squirrels and measuring metabolic costs of nocturnal activity. Whether circadian rhythms persist during hibernation is contentious. Transcription and translation are thought to be globally suppressed during deep torpor and the only study to examine clock-gene expression within the SCN during multi-day torpor found no evidence of oscillations. However, circadian body temperature rhythms have been observed in some studies of captive ground squirrels during torpor and timing of arousals has been hypothesized to be controlled by a circadian clock. Persistence of oscillations in clock-gene expression in the SCN would support existence of tissue-specific mechanisms for translational control of a subset of genes relevant to survival during hibernation. In contrast, expression of daily rhythms may not be compatible with hibernation; SCN function and or output may be inhibited to prolong torpor. This study integrates research and learning by (1) training post-docs and students from three universities in ecophysiological studies in the laboratory and field, (2) inclusion of Alaska Natives in research through participation in the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program, and (3) increasing K-12 students' engagement in research by participating in Teacher Research Experience programs. Results of research will be disseminated locally in classroom presentations and nationally through the University of Alaska media relations team."

Atmospheric carbon dioxide uptake into sea water, moderated by the time-varying amount of sea ice cover, causes acidification of Arctic Ocean waters with potentially important impacts on the marine ecosystem. One expects that the atmosphere and its chemistry will respond in a complex manner to sea ice change and Arctic warming, but the science community lacks the ability to make predictions with confidence given only basic mechanistic understanding of the relevant processes. The O-Buoy Chemical Network project was funded under an Arctic Observing Network grant to observe atmospheric chemicals, meteorology, and sea-ice properties that can improve our understanding of the relevant processes and thus improve predictability of scenarios of future climate. That project has deployed fifteen autonomous buoys measuring three sentinel atmospheric chemical species, each for roughly a year?s time, spread across the Arctic Ocean, providing detailed, high-time-resolution data relevant to understanding the Arctic atmosphere?s chemistry in relation to sea ice. In this project, the science team will synthesize, interpret, and generate fundamental understanding from the O-Buoy network data. In addition, GEOS-Chem modeling combined with the O-Buoy measurements will be used to develop a region wide understanding of the relationship between the Arctic atmosphere and sea ice.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to STEM manpower development in a number of ways.  It will provide support for an early career scientist during the formative years of his career.  It will support the training of three Ph.D. students and engage multiple undergraduate students.  Efforts will be made to draw these latter students from groups under-represented in the STEM fields by leveraging the resources of the Dartmouth College Women in Science Program (WISP) and the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program (ANSEP) at the University of Alaska.  Outreach to the K - gray community will be enabled through leveraging of existing programs such as the NSF-funded Next Generation WeatherBlur Project, the US Army Corps of Engineers' Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory's summer science camp for New Hampshire middle school students, the University of Alaska's annual Spring Science Potpourri open house, the weekly Café Scientifique in Boothbay Harbor, Maine: a summer lecture series that promotes public engagement with cutting-edge scientific research, and the extensive web presence of the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences.  <br/><br/>The Arctic Ocean's overlying atmosphere is characterized by production of reactive halogen oxidizers from sea salts that lead to depletion of ground-level ozone and deposition of mercury.  This production is believed to be modulated by the state of the sea ice cover.  This project will answer three specific science questions relevant to the overarching question ""How do changes in the Arctic Ocean environment, especially sea ice, affect the atmosphere?"" via statistical analysis and modeling approaches.  Statistical methods will test and improve process understanding while modeling approaches will be used to improve quantification of gas exchange fluxes with the Arctic Ocean through the fractured, drifting, sea ice and to predict fluxes of reactive halogen oxidizers and their precursors from sea ice.  These modeling exercises make full use of the data from the O-Buoys covering the Arctic Ocean region from 2009-2016+, a period which has had a great deal of sea ice variability and reduced sea ice compared to historical averages.  The three specific questions constituting the foci for this project are:<br/>Q1: Under what conditions are carbon dioxide air-ice-ocean fluxes important causes of atmospheric carbon dioxide variability over the Arctic Ocean and, conversely, when is long-range transport important?<br/>Q2: How do Arctic Ocean sea ice, snow, and vertical mixing conditions affect major atmospheric oxidants (ozone and reactive halogens)?<br/>Q3: How do interannual variability and long-term declines in sea ice affect atmospheric contaminants in the Arctic?"

This reality results in failure not only at elementary and          secondary levels of schooling but also at the university level as well.         Thus, the number of Native Alaskan students selecting science oriented          majors or careers is miniscule, and prospective Native teachers have            very poor science preparation perpetuating the problem.  This project           will respond to the problem by preparing Native Alaskan elementary              school teachers who have been successful in science and who will serve          as scientifically literate role models for their students and                   communities."

What types of barriers affected this connectivity, and how permeable were these barriers to gene flow? The PIs will study how caballine horses, that inhabited ice-age Beringia (the biogeographic connector between Asia and North America), were affected by changes involving three different biogeographic barriers/corridors (1. the Bering Strait/Bering Land Bridge, which controlled dispersal and gene flow between Eurasia and Alaska; 2. the Ice-Free Corridor, which controlled gene flow between the Yukon and the Lower 48 States; and 3. biome shifts that periodically disrupted the spatial continuity of the Mammoth-Steppe, the unique ecosystem that stretched from France to the Yukon during the ice ages) during the last 30,000 years of the ice age. This study will evaluate the effects that each of these putative barriers to gene flow had on the abundance, distribution, and evolutionary trajectories of ice-age horses in the Arctic using new paleogenomic and paleoenvironmental data. The results will provide new insights into the roles played by environmental change and population fragmentation in determining extinction risk, and help predict how ongoing environmental changes will affect arctic ecosystems. This project will lead to advances in the rapidly developing field of paleogenetics and further the brand-new discipline of paleogenomic ecology. The Broader Impacts plan focuses on: a) research and professional development opportunities for graduate students, b) new training opportunities for undergraduate students who aspire to become STEM high school teachers, c) outreach to Native communities in rural Alaska, and d) outreach to K-12 students in Fairbanks, AK. At the end of each summer, the pre-service teachers, graduate students, and PIs will produce an inquiry activity module for grades 9-12 to be shared with local schools. Finally, the PIs will engage in both professional and public discourse, and use the results in media productions.<br/>"

NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, and integrates the co-production of knowledge. This award fulfills part of that aim. <br/><br/>Climate change is increasing vulnerability of Arctic urban communities to natural hazards such as unstable permafrost, wildfire, and rain-in-winter events. These hazards put residents and property at risk and impose economic costs, and households, businesses, and governments must adapt to these interacting hazards. This research is developing detailed maps showing how the occurrence of these three natural hazards has evolved simultaneously in the Municipality of Anchorage and the Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, and Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada over the past several decades, and how they might change over the next 40 years. The interdisciplinary research team of economists; permafrost, fire, weather, climate, and environmental scientists; and policy experts conducts transdisciplinary research on Arctic natural hazards and their impacts on the natural and built environments and society. The research team works closely with local governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Indigenous groups, insurance companies, and residents to co-produce knowledge on the costs, risks, and actions taken to mitigate and adapt to these hazards. The team and stakeholders collaborate to determine optimal ways to measure the effects of hazards on society and the built environment, identify trade-offs and interactions, develop a multiple-hazard risk assessment, and generate options for future adaptive planning.  This project is one of the first to include effects of climate change on private as well as public infrastructure, a gap which has limited the understanding of effects of climate change in Alaska.  Results provide a framework that other Arctic communities can use to assess risks and reduce economic damages due to climate change and provide examples to increase resilience.  <br/><br/>Research activities over four years include: (1) spatial modeling and mapping of natural hazards and their interactions; (2) gathering data to assess perceived risks, values at risk, and adaptation costs with interviews, property owner surveys, and citizen science; (3) economic modeling of costs and risks; and (4) developing in a series of scenario planning workshops an adaptive policy framework that can be used to adapt to and mitigate multiple hazards and reduce future costs and risks. The research helps partner communities make better-informed decisions regarding how and where to build and manage public and private infrastructure and finance public services. This framework can be used by other Arctic communities to assess risks and reduce economic damages due to climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Field measurements across the Arctic have documented long-term and gradual warming of permafrost and recently the observations have also included rapid ice-wedge degradation in response to a single and unusually warm summer. The goal of this project is to understand the complex and interlinked processes responsible for the evolution of the pan-Arctic ice-wedge polygon tundra landscape by combining field measurements from nine Canadian, Russian, and Alaskan field sites, numerical modeling, and very high spatial resolution optical imagery that has recently become available for the entire Arctic tundra domain. <br/><br/>A combination of detailed imagery and advanced processing algorithms will allow pan-Arctic mapping of ice-wedge polygon extent and types (low- and high-centered). A map of that extent and detail does not yet exisxt, but is necessary to link carbon, water, and energy processes occurring at the ice-wedge polygon scale to the larger Arctic land-ocean-atmosphere system. Currently, permafrost thaw and subsequent carbon release is, at best, described in global models via gradual increases in active layer thickness, while field observations clearly show additional dramatic changes to the tundra ecosystem due to rapid differential ground subsidence as ice-wedges melt. A low-centered polygon landscape, which evolved over several thousand years via the slow process of ice-wedge growth, can harbor a sea of shallow ponds throughout the summer that supports a myriad of migratory birds during the breeding season. In just two years, the scene could change dramatically with exposed dry mounds where the shallow water bodies once were, while the surface water area can shrink into narrow elongated beads of deeper ponds above the melted ice-wedges. A complicated set of sub-polygon to watershed scale responses will determine the fate of the landscape. These mechanisms, part of the soil-vegetation-water continuum, will be defined via a numerical biogeophysical model informed by field measurements and repeat imagery of ice-wedge evolution. The new knowledge will support the research community in refining the role of the Arctic in the global climate system. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of this project include training of the new generation of Arctic researchers by supporting a graduate student, a post-doctoral fellow, and an early-career scientist. Fairbanks, Alaska, the base for several of the investigators, offers an excellent opportunity to show K-12 students the results of ice-wedge degradation. The products, such as the maps of ice-wedge polygon types and the projected transformation of the vegetation, water, and topography, are at spatial and temporal scales that are relevant to managers. Digital maps of ice-wedge polygon type and ground-ice estimates will be given to state and federal agencies operating in Alaska in a half-day workshop along with ice-wedge polygon ecosystem projections. The information could inform management decisions about habitat protection, or surface-water dependent oil and gas exploration activities. There will also be support for field travel for a journalist and a photographer."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.The Cultural Connections Process Model (CCPM) will formalize, implement, and test a process model for community-engaged educational resource development for Indigenous populations.  The project will collaborate with Indigenous communities to create educational resources serving Inupiaq middle school students and their teachers. Research activities take place in Northwest Alaska.  Senior personnel will travel to rural communities to collaborate with and support participants. The visits demonstrate University of Alaska Fairbanks's commitment to support pathways toward STEM careers, community engagement in research, science teacher recruitment and preparation, and STEM career awareness for Indigenous and rural pre-college students. Pre-service teachers who access to the resources and findings from this project will be better prepared to teach STEM to Native students and other minorities and may be more willing to continue careers as science educators teaching in settings with Indigenous students. The project will contribute to a greater understanding of effective natural science teaching and science career recruitment of minority students. The project's participants and the pre-college students they teach will be part of the pipeline into science careers for underrepresented Native students in Arctic communities. The project will build on partnerships outside of Alaska serving other Indigenous populations and will expand outreach associated with NSF's polar science investments.  <br/><br/>CCPM will build on cultural knowledge systems and NSF polar research investments to address science themes relevant to Inupiat people, who have inhabited the region for thousands of years.

The project research and development will engage 450 students in grades 6-8 and serves 450 students (92% Indigenous) and 11 teachers in the remote Arctic. There are two broad research hypotheses. The first is that the project will build knowledge concerning STEM research practices by accessing STEM understandings and methodologies embedded in Indigenous knowledge systems; engaging Indigenous communities in project development of curricular resources; and bringing Arctic science research aligned with Indigenous priorities into underserved classrooms. The second is that classroom implementation of resources developed using the CCPM will improve student attitudes toward and engagement with STEM and increase their understandings of place-based science concepts.  Findings from development and testing will form the basis for further development, broader implementation and deeper research to inform policy and practice on STEM education for underrepresented minorities and on rural education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The origin of the proposed study is a 2004 discovery of high trace velocity infrasound signals that appeared to be caused by pulsating aurora.  A relatively large data of ""high trace-velocity events"" and it now seems clear that pulsating aurora may not be the sole source of such signals:  while events are observed during pulsating aurora, there are many nights with extensive displays of pulsating aurora but show no signs of the infrasound signals.  However, there does seem to be a connection with the level of geomagnetic activity, since many events occurred during times of high activity as recorded by local ground-based magnetometers.  No physical process has yet been identified for the cause of these signals and there is not good understanding of the acoustic wave propagation from ionospheric sources.  The project will analyze the infrasound data set in conjunction with auroral optical and magnetic data to establish and quantify any relationships between the observed parameters and to identify possible ionospheric sources for the signals.  A large infrasonic data set is currently available, which will be complemented by additional events observed by infrasonic arrays; that data acquisition and analysis are funded through a separate program.  An important new data element will be provided by the Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) currently located at Poker Flat Research Range, Alaska.  AMISR can provide detailed spatial and temporal ionospheric information which may help in the identification of the source or sources of the infrasound signals.  The project will also provide funding for the continued operation of the auroral video camera at the University of Alaska's Geophysical Institute which will provide useful information on auroral dynamics.  In addition to the analysis and interpretation of the infrasound signals, the project will undertake a complementary study on the mechanisms by which energy can be transferred into atmospheric acoustic waves and under what conditions the energy transfer occurs.  The broader impacts of the project includes the support of a graduate student who will receive training in data acquisition and hardware, atmospheric and ionospheric dynamics and processes, and manipulation, analysis, and interpretation of large data sets.  The project will enable improved understanding of ionospheric processes and acoustic wave propagation in realistic atmospheres."

They can serve as a form of plant defense, by attracting insects that feed on the nectar and prey on herbivores.  The investigators will use field experiments to examine the defensive function of EFNs in a common North American tree species, quaking aspen.  Aspen have natural variation in the occurrence of EFNs on leaves, and this may result in differing levels of defense for aspen trees. Using this variation in EFN expression, the study will examine the role of EFNs in attracting natural enemies of the serpentine aspen leaf miner, an herbivore that currently heavily infests aspen throughout much of Alaska. Both ants and parasitic wasps are likely to be important predators on the miner. However, these species may be less able to access high versus low foliage and this could reduce the benefit of EFNs as trees grow. The study will test whether the benefits of EFNs are height-dependent.  In addition, the investigators will test the hypothesis that the aspen leaf miner avoids laying eggs on leaves with EFNs, where its offspring face a greater risk of mortality.  <br/> <br/>Broader Impacts: The study will contribute to our understanding of the evolution of plant defense and insect-plant interactions.  In addition, it will provide a better understanding of the ecological interactions and defensive traits of quaking aspen, a widespread, ecologically and economically important tree species.  The project will provide educational opportunities for two graduate students and many undergraduates at the University of Alaska, including Native Alaskans recruited through the National Science Foundation-sponsored Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program.  In addition, the investigators will produce an interactive website designed to involve K-12 students in aspen ecology.  <br/>"

These instruments will obtain two-dimensional maps of temperature and three-component wind vectors in Earth's upper atmosphere above approximately 100 km altitude, without requiring any a-priori assumptions about the nature of the flow. The roughly 250,000 square kilometer area of tristatic overlap will encompass all of the atmospheric volume observed by the National Science Foundation's new Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) at F-region heights, and most of this volume in the E-region. One of the three spectrometers required for tristatic imaging is already installed and operating at Poker Flat; this project will construct the other two. Based on demonstrated performance of the existing Poker Flat instrument, the tristatic array will be able to map true three-component winds to a precision of a few meters per second across the PFISR field of view, with a spatial resolution of 50-100 km and a time resolution varying from 1 to 10 minutes. Temperatures will be measured to a typical precision of 5K. These capabilities represent an order of magnitude improvement over what was possible even as recently as five years ago. The scientific motivation for establishing this facility is to study thermospheric dynamics at short spatial and temporal scales, which have previously been inaccessible to remote sensing. According to the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid mechanics (augmented with terms describing Joule heating and ion neutral momentum coupling), narrow channels of ionospheric convection should imprint slower but otherwise similarly structured small-scale short-lived flows onto Earth's neutral thermosphere. The objective here is to test this prediction and, should it be correct, to study the nature and consequences of these small-scale flows. Further, by providing high-resolution measurements of ion number density, flow velocity, and temperature, the PFISR radar will enable quantification of the sources of energy and momentum that establish these flows. The new all-sky imaging instruments will operate in full collaboration with existing narrow-field spectrometers at Poker Flat, Fort Yukon, and Eagle, resulting in an unprecedented cluster of five FPIs viewing a common volume over northern Alaska. This activity will create a collaborative partnership involving several existing NSF-funded projects: The PFISR radar, the Toolik Field Station, and the existing narrow-field spectrometer array. Because the new instruments will use designs from La Trobe University in Australia, the project will also establish a new international collaboration, with some scope for student travel between Alaska and Australia. The design, construction, deployment and operation of these new instruments will expose participating students to a wide range of practical research skills, in addition to the usual data analysis and interpretation that are part of any observational research project."

One modification that occurs in response to a decrease in temperature is an increase in mitochondrial density in some tissues. This process is critical for maintaining aerobic metabolic capacity in animals, yet questions remain about how it is regulated, and why it occurs in some tissues, yet not others. This project will address these questions, using the threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculetaus as a model organism. <br/> This investigation will test the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced by mitochondria in response to cold temperature and are required to induce the expression of genes controlling mitochondrial biogenesis. Membrane fluidity decreases as temperature declines and may disrupt the activity of the electron transport chain proteins of the mitochondrion, leading to the formation of ROS. These ROS may directly regulate mitochondrial-biogenic gene expression, or alternatively, high levels of ROS may stimulate the activity of nitric oxide synthase which produces nitric oxide and triggers mitochondrial biogenesis. Both of these possibilities will be tested. Sticklebacks will be maintained at 20 degrees C in the laboratory and then shifted to 5 degrees C and held over a period of six weeks. Throughout the acclimation period, animals will be harvested for measuring levels of ROS, mitochondrial proteins, gene expression, and nitric oxide synthase activity. These parameters will be measured in several tissue types, including those that undergo mitochondrial biogenesis (oxidative skeletal muscle), and those that may not (liver). The differences in response to cold temperature among different tissue types may elucidate the mechanisms underlying the tissue specificity of mitochondrial biogenesis. If ROS and/or NO levels increase during the early stages of cold acclimation, then animals will be treated with inhibitors of ROS and/or NO formation. If either of these free radical species are required to induce mitochondrial biogenesis, then inhibiting their production should prevent increases in mitochondrial density in response to cold temperature. The results from this work will lead to a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing mitochondrial biogenesis. This is a vital process, essential to the health of all organisms.<br/> This research will involve undergraduate and graduate Alaska Native students through a collaboration with the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program at the University of Alaska. These students will also help to develop an outreach program at a local rural school which engages students in learning about the variety of strategies that animals use to survive at cold temperature, with an emphasis on physiological, cellular and molecular adaptations. Students will learn the important role of animals, even those found in local environments, for addressing fundamental questions in biology. <br/>"

This project will improve education in engineering at the four participating academic institutions through adaptation and implementation of exemplary materials, laboratory experiences, and educational practices that have been developed and proven successful at the University of Minnesota (UMN) under the NSF CCLI-EMD-9952704 grant. Objectives and expected outcomes of this project are intended to revitalize courses in power electronics and electric drives with the state-of-the-art laboratories and, thus, to provide the power industry with a larger supply of better educated and trained engineers. These objectives are being accomplished by restructuring existing courses and laboratories by adapting materials and approaches developed at the UMN. Undergraduate students as well as working professionals needing formal training are special audiences targeted by the project. These initiatives motivate exceptional students to pursue their careers in these exciting and challenging fields. Therefore, they sustain and strengthen the Nation's engineering capabilities.

Considerably less is known about the role of secondary plant metabolites in ecosystem processes like carbon cycling and the breakdown of environmental pollutants. Phenolics, flavonoids, and tannins can inhibit the decomposition of plant matter.  Some of these same compounds have been shown to enhance the microbial degradation of aromatic contaminants in soil. Interestingly, boreal forest trees in Alaska possess remarkably high concentrations of secondary compounds. The boreal forest is also a critical component of the global carbon budget, housing nearly one third of the World's vegetation carbon and soil carbon. This study will make use of long-term study boreal forest sites in Alaska and Finland, including some petroleum-contaminated field plots, to test the hypothesis that certain plant secondary chemicals inhibit plant litter decomposition, while at the same time promoting pollutant degradation by microorganisms. Comprehensive analyses of plant secondary chemistry, litter decomposition, and contaminant degradation will be integrated with cutting-edge molecular approaches for characterizing microbial community composition and function in soils associated with an array of different boreal forest trees.<br/><br/>This study will generate valuable information about the chemical interactions between plants and microbes and the ramifications for ecosystem processes and global carbon cycling. New insights into plant-chemical-microbial interactions that promote organic contaminant degradation will also provide insight into the resilience of boreal forest soils to organic contaminants, and may lead to affordable methods for mitigating contamination in remote, cold regions using native plants. Opportunities for advanced research training will be provided to Alaska Native high school students as well as undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher. The public will be engaged with the themes and findings of this project through novel arts events resulting from collaborative interactions between artists and scientists."

TFS-based work has also resulted in a showcase of discoveries on the adaptations of organisms to the Arctic and population-level changes in animal and plant phenologies and distributions. Because climate is changing most rapidly in arctic and boreal regions and changes in the Arctic are predicted to strongly affect the global climate system, continuing research into the causes, mechanisms of response, and feedbacks to further ecosystem change is a high research priority. Along with the ongoing strong interest for use of TFS as a research platform by scientists from a broad array of disciplines, and a specific call for year-round studies of arctic ecosystems, this high priority promises a steady demand for TFS-based services into the future.<br/><br/>Under this agreement Toolik Field Station will:<br/>o continue to support NSF funded research projects as requested within the capacity of the station.  <br/>o develop the station infrastructure and capabilities to support evolving needs and scientific approaches. <br/>o develop the educational opportunities, both formal and informal, of the station both onsite and remotely<br/><br/>"

Much attention has focused on the loss of sea ice recorded from 2007-2012, the concomitant appearance of thousands of walruses on Alaska's and Russia's beaches, and the unfortunate consequence of large numbers of trampling mortalities.  In addition, an unusual number of walruses in poor body condition were reported on Wrangel Island in 2007, many of which subsequently died.  While walrus haul-out and mortality events are not historically isolated occurrences, these past haul-outs on Alaska's coasts, associated with reduced sea ice abundance, signify a change to this population.  These occurrences are disquieting taken together with a decrease in estimated walrus based on surveys from 2006 versus 1990, (129,000  in 2006 compared to 200,000 in 1990), and current data on reduced fertility.  The Pacific walrus is of critical importance to subsistence consumers in Alaska (and other areas of the Arctic).  Despite impressive data from in-depth studies of Pacific walruses over the last 40-50 years, it is difficult to implement proposed co-management and conservation plans based on data from such a relatively short time span, much less project the impact of additional changes to the Arctic ecosystem on both walruses and humans subsisting on them.<br/><br/>This project aims to integrate several disciplines including archaeology, ethnology, biology, and ecology using diverse sources of data including DNA, stable isotope, steroid, and trace element analysis as well as to ascertain long-term trends of walrus feeding ecology, foraging location, and stock genetics over the last two millenia. This time frame includes large climatic anomalies such as the Medieval Warm and the Little Ice Age, thereby presenting scientists with the possibility of understanding how walruses adapt during times of stress and change.  Present-day samples will be obtained from Alaskan subsistence hunters, historic samples will be acquired from museums, and prehistoric samples from archaeological collections.  Each type of data will act as a building block to better understand walruses and how they adapt to change in Arctic ecosystems.  DNA analysis will provide insights into population bottlenecks and potentially adaptive differentiation between stocks.  Stable isotope analysis of bone collagen and growth ring layers of teeth will define overall feeding ecologies of individuals through time.  Trace element analysis will reveal foraging locations, potential population structure, and changes of essential and non-essential elements over time.  Bone steroid hormones (i.e., stress hormones) can delineate population structure and health over time, and translation of historic taped interviews and use of previously archived studies will reveal traditional knowledge of walrus habitats and feeding habits over the last 100 years."

Historically, development in one or more of these areas has presented trade-offs in others; for example, petroleum exploration and development is often associated with negative impacts on traditional subsistence species and practices. Similarly, residents of the Bristol Bay region of Alaska are currently embroiled in a debate over the risks and benefits of developing of a copper and gold mine, which would ostensibly provide jobs and economic development opportunities, at the headwaters of a watershed that supports the world's largest sockeye salmon run. With an eye toward eliciting best practices for community development and resource management that target synergies rather than trade-offs, the research team plans to combine integrated regional assessments of water, food, and energy systems in three regions of the North: Bristol Bay (Alaska), Baffin Island (Canada), and Kotzebue Sound (Alaska), where people and communities share a variety of challenges relating to climate change, socioeconomic change, and industrial development. The research methods that make up the project's interdisciplinary toolkit include key informant interviews, integration and analysis of secondary datasets, climate change downscaling, engineering best practice and gap analysis, and rural-urban network analysis. The research team will link these qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore cause-and-effect relationships between development activities and societal and environmental changes, and will integrate social and ecological datasets with climate change scenarios to project future community responses to climatic and environmental change. The findings of this research will inform a collaborative education and outreach program designed to build capacity through workforce development, STEM internships, and post-secondary curricula and programs in environmental management and engineering."

Research is being conducted over a twelve  month period in Bethel, Alaska which is the hub of the Yukon-  Kuskokwim Delta, the most populous region of Yup'ik speakers in the  state.  The hospital there serves as the medical center for 56  villages.  The project entails collaboration with the Alaska Native  regional health entity operating the hospital to prioritize  specific issues of concern within the topic of Yup'ik conceptions  of wellness.  The specific issues identified are the focus of  ethnographic research at the hospital.    By most epidemiologic, economic, demographic, and social health  measures, this region is the most disadvantaged in the state.   Acute infectious disease contributes substantial morbidity.   Additionally, many health problems are due to chronic disease,  injury, and other health problems that have a behavioral factor as  a contributing cause, the prevention which entails a behavior  change component.  The illness profile describing the disease and  psychosocial dysfunction of the people of the region is well  defined.  A wellness profile will be developed through compilation  of quantitative data on diachronic indices of risk factors and  health behavior change, and qualitative, ethnograpic data  describing cognitive categories related to preventive health  domains, explanatory models of illness episodes and their  relationship to wellness, and health behavior ""success stories"".    By focusing on contemporary beliefs, the research will advance the  knowledge of:  Yup'ik conceptual categories of etiology and  prevention; beliefs of a much wider age group than has previously  been described; and beliefs related to health issues previously  unexamined.  Paradoxically, this work that focuses on the  contemporary and on fostering behavior change, could advance the  Yup'ik cultural revitalization agenda by reinforcing  the  traditional Yup'ik value of illness prevention and belief in the  role of human agency in the health of the individual and the  community.    Interactive activities include teaching an undergraduate course,  instruction and supervision of students as research assistants,  teaching a graduate course for health care providers, giving guest  lectures including instruction for Community Health Aides at the  Alaska Statewide Community Health Aide Conference in Anchorage in  April 1997."

The specific objectives of this project are threefold. The first objective is to extend mathematical development of a modeling approach for assessing the impact of toxin-mediated interactions between multiple plant species and herbivores. The second objective is to integrate toxin-mediated browsing dynamics into the existent theory of boreal forest community dynamics. The final objective is to explore the roles that landscape disturbance, patterns of patchiness, and adaptive browsing play in shaping the plant community. These models are developed to reflect the biological complexity of plant-herbivore systems and will provide unique insight into how herbivore factors, plant factors, and environmental factors impact the establishment and spread of toxic plants in natural systems.<br/><br/>The modeling studies in this project have critical societal importance because of the key role that moose and other herbivores play in indigenous societies in the boreal forest. Moose, the largest herbivore in Alaska, are a major source of protein for residents in interior Alaska. For generations, Athabascan Indians have harvested moose, which provide a valuable nutritional and cultural resource, so changes in moose abundance and distribution can have large impacts on subsistence users.  This is especially true in rural areas where availability of alternative resources can be limited, and lack of job opportunities and high poverty levels make subsistence harvest an essential component of rural economies. Toxins in plants are known to affect intake and plant selection in herbivores which in turn can influence ecosystem processes such as succession.  Succession in turn influences the quality of moose habitat, distribution, and ultimately harvest.  This research project will improve understanding of how toxins influence plant selectivity by moose during succession in the boreal forest. Models developed will explore future scenarios of vegetation, herbivores, and their consequences for subsistence.  Additionally, process-based understanding of the impacts of recent climate warming and increases in wildfire on moose abundance and distribution will be improved, and therefore subsistence opportunities for indigenous residents of Alaska.  Lastly, such information can help better inform wildlife managers and allow for more proactive management policies."

A downward September trend has accelerated over the last decade, with the 10 lowest September sea-ice extents occurring in the last 10 years. An essentially ice-free Arctic during summer is expected by mid-century. Loss of the sea- ice cover has profound consequences for ecosystems and human activities in the Arctic, so there is an urgent need to advance sea-ice predictions in all seasons at both the pan-Arctic and regional scales. A better quantification of the role of oceanic heat and climate variations in the Pacific sector, new observational-based sea-ice products, and network activities will advance understanding of seasonal predictability of Arctic sea ice, the limits of this predictability, and the economic value of forecasts for stakeholders. The network supported by this grant will examine origins and impacts of extreme ocean surface warming in preconditioning the ice cover in the Pacific Arctic for continued major reductions in sea-ice extent and duration. <br/><br/>A key finding that emerged from the earlier Sea Ice Prediction Network (SIPN) effort is that predictions of September sea-ice extent tend to have less skill in extreme years that strongly depart from the trend line. The objective of proposed research under Phase 2 of SIPN (SIPN2) is to improve forecast skill through adopting a multi-disciplinary approach that includes modeling, new products, data analysis, scientific networks, and stakeholder engagement. This grant will: Investigate the sensitivity of subseasonal-to-seasonal sea-ice predictability in the Alaska Arctic to variations in oceanic heat and large- scale atmospheric forcing using a dynamical model Community Earth System Model (NCAR CESM) and statistical forecasting tools, focusing on spatial fields in addition to total extent summaries; Assess the accuracy of Sea Ice Outlook (SIO) submissions based on methodology and initialization; Develop new observation-based products for improving sea-ice predictions, including sea-ice thickness, surface roughness, melt ponds, and snow depth; Evaluate the socio-economic value of sea-ice forecasts to stakeholders who manage ship traffic and coastal village resupply in the Alaska Sector, and engage the public in Arctic climate and sea-ice prediction through blog exchanges, accessible SIO reports, bi-monthly webinars, and by making public data sources useful to non-scientists and scientists alike; and Continue and evolve network activities to generate SIO forecasts and reporting for September minima as in SIPN and expand SIPN2 forecasts to include full spatial resolution and emerging ice-anomaly-months (October - November). <br/><br/>This work will directly engage stakeholders that create and use sea-ice forecasts in Alaska and lead to improved safety around sea ice. Work under SIPN2 will also track public awareness and perceptions regarding sea ice, helping to raise understanding through accessible reports, discussions, and public data sources useful to non-scientists and scientists alike.

To determine small-scale flow structures, all seven of the Fabry-Perot spectrometers now in Alaska will be configured to focus their attention simultaneously onto one small geographic region roughly coinciding with the field of view of the PFISR radar. These instruments will simultaneously monitor thermospheric temperatures and wind vectors, producing two-dimensional maps of temperatures and 3-component vector winds, with a spatial resolution of around 80 km. The array will operate in this mode for three campaigns each lasting around two-months.<br/> To quantify the importance of small-scale eddies and waves in the thermosphere, the project will address three focused science questions: (1) What is the occurrence frequency, intensity, spectral distribution, and overall morphology of the small-scale eddies and waves in Alaska?s auroral thermosphere, for both quiet and active conditions? (2) Is it possible to identify the driver mechanisms and source regions for these small-scale features, based on timing of their occurrence relative to other measurements, the spatial alignment of their phase fronts, and the directions in which they?re propagating? (3) Is it possible to estimate the momentum flux and dissipation rates of these waves, based on the amplitudes, periods, and horizontal & vertical wavelengths of the temperature and 3-component wind perturbations, and on the time evolution of these quantities?

The fast pace of these changes has prompted concern because boreal forests make up about a third of all forests worldwide, contain almost half of the world's stored carbon, and have been historically stable with black spruce dominating this landscape for the past 6,000 years. Warming of 2-8 °C is projected by the end of the century and the emergence of a new fire regime threatens to disrupt this forest ecosystem. For example, in some regions of interior Alaska, the fire return interval has decreased to 10-50 years, causing shifts from black spruce to deciduous trees and grasses. Changes in the climate and fire regime are also expected to affect global carbon cycling since fires and thawing of frozen soils (permafrost) may release large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. This research will incorporate field studies and computer simulations to determine how fire frequency and climate change affect shifts between vegetation types (e.g. switch from conifer to grasses) and long term carbon storage in this vast and under-studied region. The study will train graduate students and involve Native American high school students from the Rural Alaska Honors Institute (RAHI) in field work. The investigators will collaborate with Your World Rocks (YWR), a nonprofit organization of female scientists and engineers dedicated to promoting science education in elementary schools. They will develop hands-on activities focusing on climate change, forests, and fire and conduct free hands-on activities in elementary schools in the greater Portland/Vancouver metro area, with a particular focus on underserved Title 1 schools. <br/><br/>The fast pace of climate warming and an increase in fire frequency over the past few decades in northern latitudes has raised concerns about major shifts in vegetation and the long-term ability of ecosystems to capture and store carbon. Boreal forest ecosystems account for about 33% of all forests worldwide and contain about 45% of the world's carbon stocks, with the majority (~85%) stored belowground. For the past 6,000 years, black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) has been the dominant species over a large proportion of this landscape, exhibiting substantial resilience to changes in climate. However, unprecedented warming (causing earlier snowmelt, permafrost thawing, and longer growing seasons) and the emergence of a new fire regime over the past 60 years threatens to disrupt the existing dominance by black spruce and release globally significant amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. The goal of this research is to quantify the potential for large-scale changes in carbon (C) sink strength, C stocks, and vegetation in boreal forests due to climate change and repeated wildfires by integrating mechanistic field and lab work with dynamic, spatially explicit landscape modeling. Working in central Alaska, the investigators will: 1) determine how fire frequency and climate change affect successional trajectories and above- and belowground C cycling, and 2) assess how the mechanisms that cause tipping points between vegetation types (i.e. conifer, hardwood, graminoid) and C sequestration (i.e. sink, source) vary spatially and temporally. To achieve these objectives, the investiagors will empirically measure above- and belowground C stocks, productivity, heterotrophic respiration, soil temperature and moisture content, and active layer thickness in the field and quantify C mineralization using laboratory soil incubations. They will also develop and validate a physically based permafrost/hydrology module for a widely-used, high resolution landscape simulation model (LANDIS-II) to forecast long-term dynamics of species composition and C source/sink status given projected changes in climate (including thawing permafrost) and fire. The work will improve our understanding of how C cycling and species composition in boreal forests will respond to climate change and disturbances at the fine spatial scales critical to accurately project the future of the boreal forest."

Bacteria colonize and coat the inside pipe surfaces in DWDSs to form biofilms that are responsible for a multitude of problems, including corrosion, taste and odor issues, formation of carcinogenic disinfection-by-products (DBPs), loss of the chlorine residual that protects the water from pathogenic microorganisms. All of these problems have serious financial and public health ramifications for the United States. This project aims to develop a fundamental mechanistic understanding of how biofilms attach to pipes, how strong they are, and how easily they can become detached from the pipe surfaces. This research will be used to develop strategies for removal of biofilms from the DWDSs to address the national goal of ensuring safe drinking water to the citizenry. The broader impacts of this research for society include the development of new technological solutions for water utilities and water plant operators. The project also aims to engage Alaska Native undergraduate students in engineering research, with the long-term goal of increasing the number and broadening the participation of Alaska Native students and graduates in engineering.<br/><br/>The research goal of this CAREER project is to enhance the understanding of biofilm mechanical properties, with specific application to biofilms in drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs). To meet this overall goal, the proposal has three objectives: (1) investigate the correlation between the biofilm exopolymeric substance (EPS) matrix components and biofilm strength in the DWDS; (2) test novel biofilm weakening strategies and examine the impact of these weakening strategies on the contribution of biofilms to DBP formation in the DWDS; and (3) evaluate the impact of distribution system hydraulics and disinfection on biofilm detachment, biofilm cluster formation and reattachment in the DWDS. A primary educational objective of this project is to involve Alaska Native undergraduate students in engineering research.  Biofilms will be grown in special bench-scale biofilm growth reactors that provide controlled and well-defined environmental conditions simulating distribution systems. Advanced microscopic and spectroscopic techniques (e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, confocal scanning laser microscopy and atomic force microscopy) and biofilm-specific micro-cantilever methods will be employed for determination of EPS compositional analysis and mechanical properties. The PI will also investigate a novel strategy for biofilm weakening by targeting the biofilm EPS, instead of the traditional approach of inactivating biofilm bacteria by using biocides. For that purpose, a suite of strength modifiers and detachment promoting agents for biofilms in DWDSs will be evaluated. The mechanistic study of biofilm cohesive strength will identify the role of various EPS macromolecules in providing strength and structure to biofilms, which will be helpful in designing effective strategies for biofilm control. The insights into the mechanistic basis of biofilm strength and detachment will increase our ability to control and manipulate biofilms in various environmental systems (e.g., biofilters, wastewater treatment, DWDSs) and beyond (e.g., medical biofilms). Understanding biofilm dynamics and detachment in DWDSs will help design better strategies to provide improved drinking water quality, significantly benefitting public health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has been stable for 33 years, but rapidly began to calve and retreat in December 1994.  It has receded one kilometer over nine-months and is calving into 270-meter deep water.  This proposal addresses many of the key issues and recommendations from the recent National Science Foundation (NSF)-sponsored tidewater glacier workshop.  Previous studies on similar glaciers have focused on processes at and near the terminus.  In this study, the Principal Investigators will measure and characterize a number of parameters along the entire length of the glacier and not just the snout or terminus.  The objectives are to:  1) understand what controls the stability of calving glaciers; 2) characterize glacier calving, especially submarine events; and 3) measure and characterize proglacial sedimentation to assess its effects on the dynamics and stability of calving glaciers.  Because the Le Conte Glacier is rapidly calving, this is a ""time-critical"" study and it is important to begin collecting data while the glacier is in the initial stages of the calving retreat.  Repeated airborne elevation profiling, which has not been preciously used on glaciers, will be used to measure changes in surface geometry along the full length of the glacier on a seasonal and annual basis."

Line length measurements from 1975-1988 showed barely significant right lateral shear strain in two networks crossing the Denali fault, yet geologic estimates of the Holocene slip rate on the Denali fault are 8-12 mm/yr. Seismicity North of the Denali fault is concentrated in NE trending zones, with left-lateral slip on steeply dipping NE to NNE striking planes. These left-lateral, strike-slip faults have been interpreted as secondary faults bounding elongated crustal blocks in a broad shear zone between the Denali and Tintina (right-lateral) strike-slip faults. The PIs will measure the slip rate on the Denali fault and place some initial constraints on the strain rate across the active seismic zones to the north of it, using data from GPS (Global Positioning System) surveys and permanent GPS sites. They will also survey an extensive network across the active seismic zones that can be re-occupied in the future to more fully characterize the active deformation.  ***"

ALASKA    This project is designed to gather and synthesize currently available environmental data (landscape characteristics, meteorology, active layer and permafrost characteristics) along the East Siberian transect through the Sakha Republic, Russia, in a GIS with the same format as being planned in Alaska.  The data will be used to calibrate currently available numerical and analytical models at 15 to 20 sites and be used to investigate current active layer and permafrost conditions, to scale up the results, to investigate past active layer and permafrost conditions using the meteorological record and temperatures in permafrost boreholes, and to predict future (50 to 100 years) active layer and permafrost conditions using available climatic scenarios for the region.  Information on past and future variations in the active layer and permafrost is important in assessing past and future changes in the decomposition and storage of carbon in arctic soils which governs the release of trace gases to the atmosphere.  Thawing of permafrost will allow plants to tap more nutrients leading to changes in the arctic ecosystems.  The proposed study is designed to integrate with existing and future research projects in the program by providing data for use in model parameterization and validating other model predictions."

Planning for long-term development at TFS has been guided by a long-range plan produced by the user community in 1995.  The need for a current vision for the direction of research requirements for infrastructure, services, and function was a prime recommendation of the December 2003 TFS Steering Committee meeting.  Over the last few years, TFS management has heard requests from science users for TFS to move away from the model where acquisition, repair, and maintenance of scientific equipment and the provision of core technical services are done by individual scientific projects to a new model wherein more core services are provided and supported centrally. <br/><br/>To best respond to the issues of whether and how to develop more  multi-use core facilities and scientific services, and to establish priorities for implementing them requires input from the scientific user community.  Input is also needed to address the need for strategies for protecting the long-term research investment, and for a plan to further develop the science education component of TFS. We propose to convene a  focused  and relatively small (20-25 invited  guests)  workshop  of  arctic  researchers  working  at  TFS  and  other  scientists  with experience in the development of field research facilities.  <br/><br/>The goals of the workshop include the following.  1) Address whether and to what extent <br/>TFS should develop multi-use core lab facilities and scientific services, and if so, prioritize what <br/>those facilities should be. 2) Address what changes in data management and connectivity would <br/>be necessary to  enable  the science at TFS to achieve a new level of  sophistication. 3) Set <br/>priorities for the preservation of long-term control areas around the station. 4) Discuss possible <br/>expansion of the education program at TFS.   <br/><br/>The primary product of this workshop will be a white paper summarizing the recommendations of the workshop, and a prioritized plan for implementing multi-use core facilities at TFS.  We envision that this document may be used for planning future upgrades and scientific services at TFS, by station management and funding agencies<br/><br/>"

The relationship between different optical features and different radio features, however, is poorly understood.  Wave phenomena in the auroral regions play an important role in the energy flow between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere.  In order to understand the relationships between optical and radio phenomena in the auroral region it is necessary to monitor the region with a variety of instruments.  This project will utilize data from optical imaging instruments, radar backscatter from auroral features, and plasma wave, electric field, magnetic field and particle measurements from satellites crossing the auroral regions.  Satellites which will be used in the study include the defense department DMSP satellites, NASA's FAST, WIND, POLAR, SAMPEX, and IMAGE satellites, and the European CLUSTER mission.  A ground-based radio imaging system will be used to locate the regions producing auroral Medium Frequency (MF) radio emissions.  The investigation will also contribute to studies of the timing and location of magnetic substorm onsets.  The radio imaging instruments will be deployed at existing facilities in Alaska and Greenland.  The data will be made available to all researchers, including those using the Alaska and Greenland facilities.  The research project will also be integrated with educational activities being carried out by the three collaborating institutions (Dartmouth College, Siena College, and the Univ. of Alaska).  In particular the educational effort at Dartmouth will include a focus toward the Dartmouth Women-in Science-Program (WISP).  Students will be involved with both the engineering aspects of the new instrumentation as well as the analysis of the resulting scientific data."

Although the physical/biological conditions associated with (1) annual variability in fish survival, and (2) the spatial distribution of juveniles are amenable to description, neither the underlying mechanisms to explain them nor the link between two are known. <br/><br/>This proposal aims to achieve both understanding and predictability by using a comparative approach while synthesizing several data sets for coho salmon. This species was studied by GLOBEC in both Southeast Alaska (SEAK) and the California Current System (CCS), and its abundance covaries inversely in the two systems. The biological/physical conditions under which juvenile coho salmon were found in GLOBEC NEP-funded studies in SEAK and the variation of the juvenile salmon habitat over 8 years at one location and 4 years at another will be described. An individual-based model will be employed to assess the advantages of these habitats to growth and mortality of juvenile coho salmon, and to describe how individual salmon could interact with such spatial distributions. The findings of a GLOBEC-NEP funded retrospective study regarding potential predator buffering effects will be extended in time and space. Local indicators of biologically important physical conditions, based on local winds and general circulation, will be developed to study the response of individual stocks along the coast north of the bifurcation of the West Wind Drift (WWD). The coded wire tag data set, which spans both systems, will be used together with GLOBEC observations in the NEP to derive a model of coho salmon early life history that is consistent across the two systems, but can have different physical forcing in each.<br/><br/>The ultimate product of this project is an indicator of annual ocean conditions that affect salmon survival and age of spawning. This indicator will be directly useful in the short term in fishery management and in the long term by reducing the uncertainty and contentiousness surrounding management of factors influencing the freshwater phase of the salmon lifecycle.

The site contains the oldest and best preserved collection of faunal remains from the American Arctic, and an assemblage of stone tools that includes fluted projectile points. Fluted projectile points are a type of stone weapon tip associated with the initial phase of human settlement in most regions of the New World. They have not, however, been reliably dated in eastern Beringia (Alaska and unglaciated portions of Yukon), a region of critical importance for thinking about the colonization of the Americas since it was a presumed waypoint for the initial settlers of North and South America as they expanded from their Asian homeland. In the absence of secure dating Beringian fluted points have yet to be situated in a historical or ecological context, and there is little known about the behavior of the people who used this technology or their relationship to fluted point users in the midcontinent. <br/><br/>This project will address these issues through interdisciplinary studies at Raven Bluff and analyses of existing fluted point assemblages found in museum collections. At Raven Bluff a research team will: establish a chronological and stratigraphic framework for the archaeological deposits; reconstruct the late Pleistocene and early Holocene environmental setting; describe strategies of faunal exploitation and resource use; and characterize the stone tool production and maintenance activities conducted at the site, including methods of fluted point manufacture and repair. Building on insights from our detailed studies at Raven Bluff we also plan to reexamine existing fluted point assemblages from Alaska, as well as published data from selected fluted point assemblages from the midcontinent, in order to evaluate hypotheses about the transmission and development of fluted point technology within Beringia, and its transmission between Beringia and the midcontinent.<br/><br/>Insights resulting from this work will help resolve longstanding questions about the timing of the fluted point occupation in Beringia, and the subsistence and technological adaptations of the people who made fluted point in an extreme, high latitude environment. It will also fill a major geographic and temporal gap in our knowledge of Paleoindian dispersals throughout the Americas. These issues are important because they are connected to the general process of first entry and adaptive radiation of people in all parts of the world, and shed light on the means by which small scale societies adapt to diverse environmental challenges. The broader impacts of this study include training and mentoring of high school, undergraduate and graduate students. Education and outreach efforts through the PolarTREC program will bring an issue of great public interest and scientific importance?the earliest period of cultural development in the New World ?into classrooms across the country."

Excavation in 2008 recovered three organic points in well-stratified contexts, with what appear to be slots for microblade insets. These finds are directly associated with Component 3 at the site, dating to ~10,100 cal BP. The points are worked: some exhibit hafting elements and may also contain embedded lithics (some silt has yet to be removed). The organic artifacts are have been recovered from intermittently frozen soils and are drying out, necessitating immediate stabilization efforts as well as long-term conservation. The remains are currently stable, provided they do not undergo handling, which limits analyses that can be performed. Once conserved, they will undergo X-ray analysis to help describe the morphology and to identify any small lithics that might remain embedded in the slots. Residue-analysis, lithic analysis, and technological (manufacturing techniques) analyses will be performed once the artifacts are conserved."

Whale migration routes and habitat use are determined by zooplankton aggregations, which are driven by oceanographic conditions, which depend on the climatic regime. Successful hunting depends on interactions between environmental and societal factors that vary each year and are driven by forces originating outside the system. This complex suite of environment-whale-human factors comprises a system that is vulnerable both to global climate and human generated change. This proposal seeks to identify and understand the complex linkages, mechanisms, and interactions within and between the atmosphere, ocean, and human components of this system. The response and resilience of these components and the system as a whole to variable forcing by external environmental change will also be investigated. The work is highly interdisciplinary and focuses on the linked ocean-human systems of coastal Alaska, concentrating specifically near Barrow, Alaska. <br/><br/>Four distinct yet highly interrelated approaches to understanding the system are used: 1) Biological and physical ocean modeling to identify mechanisms of frontal and eddy formation and plankton aggregation, to describe the effects of environmental forcing from outside on the local ocean, and to understand longer term, past and future variability in outside forcing on whaling success, 2) High resolution field sampling to demonstrate presence of physical features and associated biological concentrations and to validate modeling, 3) Assessment of the resilience and vulnerability of the subsistence hunting economy and culture in Barrow, and 4) Retrospective analysis synthesizing modeled ocean and climate conditions with available information on whale location, feeding, and harvest success to asses the resilience and vulnerability of the whale-ocean-human system to environmental change. <br/><br/>Intrinsic Merit: On the local scale, the results of the research will provide a greater understanding of the factors influencing a natural resource, demonstrating linkages between discovery and application to policy issues of bowhead whale management. The social structure and fabric of the Inupiat communities are intimately linked to the whaling tradition and are particularly vulnerable to both environmental change and human-generated pressures. On the broader scale, the research will address how multiple physical, biological, and human factors are linked in a complex natural system that may be critically affected by environmental variability. Biogeochemical and physical manifestations of climate change in this region (e.g., ice reduction, changes in marine mammal migration and ecosystem structure) will have consequences for local human linkages to the Arctic ecosystem by influencing hunting success, ease of travel, and the relative importance of subsistence and cash economies and are representative of those of the broader Arctic with important impacts on global carbon cycling. All these topics are highly relevant to the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) program. This project is cutting-edge in that it assimilates research of multiple disciplines from oceanography to social science to address questions that can only successfully be answered using this multi-faceted, integrative approach. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The locally relevant science proposed for this project is of significant interest to the Barrow community and neighboring villages, to policy makers at the IWC, NOAA, and MMS, and to the broader public. The interdisciplinary collaborative partnership between academic researchers and staff at a federal agency and at a regional wildlife management agency is an investment in human and social capital that enhances the broader research infrastructure. Climate variability and its effects on access to and mobility within the Arctic Ocean have broader impacts for global and local commerce and national security. The proposed high school internship program involves the participation of native people who are often underrepresented in the fields of science and technology. Broader involvement of high school students and teachers through the ARMADA program will communicate to the scientists of the next generation understanding of field research, of the Arctic Ocean ecosystem, and of the importance of climate variability to this ecosystem. <br/>"

It is part of the Northern Athabaskan language continuum and falls between Deg Hit'an (Ingalik) and Koyukon.  Linguistically, it is closer to Lower Koyukon, although culturally the Holikachuk people are closer to the Deg Hit'an.<br/><br/>Today Holikachuk is the most endangered Athabaskan language of Alaska and it is in danger of disappearing with the passing of the oldest generation.  There are approximately twelve speakers left among an estimated population of 200 ethnic Holikachuk (Krauss, 1997:32).  Furthermore, all speakers are over sixty years of age and some are quite elderly.  Holikachuk is also an under-documented language.  There is no detailed study of the language and no grammatical description goes beyond the basic phonology.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is the comprehensive grammatical description of Holikachuk resulting in the publication of a detailed descriptive grammar of the language.  This will be achieved through extensive fieldwork and analysis of all data previously recorded on Holikachuk.  The grammar will be the result of several phases of analysis following each field season and it will be published by the Alaska Native Language Center.  A computer database program will be used to start compiling a Holikachuk dictionary.<br/><br/>The resulting field notes and descriptive grammar will be useful to language preservationists, linguists and scholars in related disciplines, and the Holikachuk community.  This project will be the first step towards insuring the preservation of Holikachuk by providing a permanent comprehensive record of the language.  In doing so, it will contribute directly to the study of comparative Athabaskan and of the Northern Athabaskan language continuum.  The textual material is important to Oral History and Anthropology and will contribute to the expansion of the ethnographic record on the Holikachuk people and Northern Athabaskan cultures.  The Holikachuk community will gain a permanent record of their ancestral language as well as tools necessary for the production of pedagogical materials for the development of revitalization programs.<br/>"

These DEMs often have large errors at the sheet boundaries, making them difficult to mosaic accurately.  In contrast, the Star3i X-band airborne-radar system operated by Intermap Technology Corporation, creates a topographically seamless DEM at 5 m pixel size with a mean vertical error of 1 to 3 m, depending on product purchased. Intermap acquired the Kuparuk watershed in August of 2001, and this DEM is now available as an off-the-shelf product.  <br/><br/>The distribution package made available to NSF researchers will include more than the raw data.  The team will validate the new DEMs for accuracy,  principally through comparing hydrologic channel networks created from the DEMs with those found in the real world.  They will also produce vector layers of these stream channels for use in many GIS applications, and calculate some basic hydrological information on the watershed. They will include a variety of shareware software to allow novice users to easily access the data, as well as include a number of still images and animations for use in analysis and outreach. Finally, they will include a number of references and technical specifications to help new users understand the limitations of the data. <br/><br/>The DEM will be made available to all NSF researchers through JOSS.<br/><br/>"

These studies have shown that 1) sea otters indirectly maintain kelp forests by limiting herbivorous sea urchins, and 2) this trophic cascade has strong indirect effects on a number of other species and ecosystem processes. These insights were obtained largely through the comparison of islands in the Aleutian archipelago with and without sea otters, an opportunity created by the spatially asynchronous population recovery of sea otters following their decimation by the Pacific maritime fur trade. <br/><br/>In the course of more than 35 years of studies, these researchers have obtained an extensive amount of data on sea otter populations, kelp forest communities, and an array of associated marine wildlife from numerous Aleutian Islands with and without sea otters. Sea otter populations have since collapsed and the species is now ecologically extinct across the entire region. In this study, Drs. Konar, Edwards and Estes will combine the multi-decadal database with this extinction event to chronicle the patterns and mechanisms of spatial and temporal change in distributions and abundances of sea urchins and fleshy macroalgae (kelps and other species).   They will do this by revisiting 20 islands for which they have long-term data and re-censusing the historical kelp forest monitoring sites for the abundance and population structure of sea urchins, and for the abundance and species composition of kelps and other fleshy macroalgae. In combination, these data will provide an account of the degree to which the otter-urchin kelp trophic cascade has changed with the collapse of sea otters across the Aleutian archipelago.<br/><br/>The available information indicates that kelp forests collapsed very rapidly following the sea otter decline, and that this rapid shift was facilitated by the upward migration of sea urchins from deep water as opposed to in situ recruitment and growth. This group of marine scientists will test this idea by measuring various temperature- and nutrient sensitive isotopic patterns along the growth increment of sea urchin spines of animals collected from shallow and deep water. Similar to a depth refuge for urchins, studies from other areas have suggested that macroalgae may have a spatial refuge from urchin grazing in shallow waters or amongst very dense algal stands. They will explore macroalgal spatial refuges by using data collected during the re-censusing of the kelp forest monitoring sites and by extending our surveys to shallower waters and isolated kelp beds.<br/><br/>This research is an opportunity to rigorously explore and document the influences of a large vertebrate predator on the interaction web dynamics of its associated ecosystem.  The intellectual merit of this project emphasizes the special character of oceanic islands and the Arctic for the study of near-shore ecosystem structure and processes.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of this project include benefits to society, teaching, and training. The project will be very newsworthy because it will describe the current status of a rapidly declining marine mammal and will document changes that have occurred due to fluctuations in the abundance of this species over the last 20+ years. Training and educational opportunities will be offered to graduate students from three different universities. The project will involve the University of Alaska Fairbanks, University of California Santa Cruz, and San Diego State University. <br/><br/>"

Water used for drinking or cleaning can promote good health or propagate disease. Water supports the plants and animals used for subsistence harvest. Water prevents or promotes access to food or shelter. Water has always been and will always be integral to the culture of humans in the Arctic. <br/><br/>In the past 30 years, the climate in the Arctic has warmed appreciably and there is evidence for a significant polar amplification of global warming in the future. Recent studies suggest that climate change will have a significant impact on arctic hydrology. Changes in the hydrologic cycle will affect both the presence of surface water and the thermal balance in soil. While preliminary evidence suggests a changing climate will have a significant impact on the hydrologic cycle in arctic regions, very little evidence is available to predict how the quality and quantity of freshwater available to humans is likely to change. Even less is understood about how hydrologic changes will affect the health, sustainability, and culture of humans in the Arctic. <br/><br/>The overall objective of the proposed research is to understand the vital role of freshwater in the lives of humans in the Arctic, how it has changed in the recent past, and how it is likely to change in the future. This work will build a model that will allow us to predict climate-induced changes in the hydrologic cycle and their effects on water quality and availability. On the basis of this data, it will attempt to understand how these changes will impact the life and culture of Arctic peoples. This study will take place on the Seward Peninsula, where climate-induced changes in the hydrologic cycle are already apparent. Although the Seward Peninsula is south of the Arctic Circle, it is a very good analogue for a warmer Arctic. It is predominantly underlain by continuous permafrost in the northern and central peninsula and the predominant vegetation is tussock tundra. This project will draw upon community interaction, historical documentation, field observations, laboratory experimentation, and computer modeling. The PIs have extensive experience conducting research on the Seward Peninsula, working both in the physical and social sciences. <br/><br/>The broader impact of this project are two fold. Regionally it will employ a public outreach program to promote water resource education and awareness in Alaskan villages. This project will involve efforts to increase participation of Alaska Natives in undergraduate and graduate studies. Outreach will be accomplished by integrating this proposal into existing education infrastructure between the University of Alaska and some Seward Peninsula villages. <br/><br/>Globally, the broader impact of this study lies in its extractability to the entire circumpolar Arctic. The Seward Peninsula lies at the southern boundary of continuous permafrost. In this environment, slight changes in the permafrost will cause long lasting changes to the hydrologic cycle and the quality and availability of freshwater. If the climate continues to warm, the southern boundary of permafrost will advance northward, eventually impacting all humans in the Arctic. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the building of a model for interdisciplinary work that truly integrates the physical and social sciences. This project couples the work of a cultural anthropologist, a biologist, a hydrologist and an engineer. No one part of this project is independent. In order to understand the potential impacts of climate-induced changes in the hydrologic cycle on humans, two things are required. First, the potential hydrologic changes must be quantified. This requires regional scale modeling of a physical science. Second, the social science is necessary to characterize the human dependence on the resource and response to potential changes. Without the true integration of these two objectives one cannot begin to understand the intersection between climate change, water resources, and humans in the Arctic. While this study is on water as a resource, this experimental approach could be extended to other resources in the future. <br/>"

The goals of the original CAREER project were to document aspects of the syntax and discourse of the endangered Aleut language and to create language learning materials for adults. The research under the CAREER project generated an unanticipated amount of sound recordings, which were transcribed, analyzed, and incorporated into language learning materials for college-level coursework.  This project will continue the transcription and analysis of many of the remaining recordings with the support of a student assistant.  In addition, new research goals have been set to include the investigation of discourse, metaphor and variability in expression of the Eastern Aleut language.  This research is critically important as many of the fluent speaker are very elderly and the linguistic research supported here has not previously been described in the academic literature.   <br/><br/>By collecting previously undocumented types of texts as well as focusing on analyses of less-well studied levels of language use, this project will result in major contributions to the understanding of contemporary Aleut, as well as in unique contributions in to the fields of Eskimo-Aleut Linguistics and General Linguistics.

The goal of the project is to retain the scholarship students by integrating them into the Alaskan community of sustainability research and education.  Project elements include (a) a comprehensive recruitment strategy, (b) a strong mentoring program, (c) career and communication workshops, and (d) supplementary courses and early research involvement.   Acknowledging the regional need to prepare students who have backgrounds in environmental science and that participation in research related to solving civic problems has a strong appeal for Native American and Native Alaskan students, the project team has designed a rigorous, 30- credit hour curriculum for an interdisciplinary Certificate in Resilience and Adaptation (sustainability) which participants are encouraged to complete.  In order to broaden participation, Native American and Native Alaskan students are recruited actively.<br/><br/>There are two important ways in which this project will have broad impact.  First, data generated through assessment and evaluation is expected to support the rationale that high retention of students in STEM fields can be achieved through a comprehensive academic program linked to community-based research and civic engagement.  Formative evaluation is carried out to examine whether or not a diverse group of students is recruited and equipped to (a) maintain the target GPA (3.0 or higher), (b) perform skills at the appropriate level, (c) graduate with a STEM degree.  Summative evaluation is to ascertain whether or not the project goal to increase the number of well-prepared students in the selected fields is accomplished based on the Student Assessment of Learning Gains, student essays, and post-graduation data.  Secondly, dissemination of the project results is expected to provide a model for implementation of community-based practices in recruitment and retention of STEM students.

Classical collisionless theoretical treatments have produced interesting and fundamentally important results, such as Landau damping in the linear regime, and Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) modes in one dimension (1D) for the nonlinear case. However, a real plasma actually has a certain level of collisions, no matter how weak it is. Recently the physical picture of Landau damping with weak collisions has been shown to be completely different from the collisionless case [Ng, Bhattacharjee and Skiff,Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 065002 (2004); 83, 1974 (1999)]. This occurs because the collision term<br/>actually represents a singular perturbation of the collisionless problem, and will become important when sharp gradients develop in the velocity space. Such sharp gradients also invalidate assumptions of linearization so that nonlinear effects must be included. At the same time, higher dimensional effects, which are important to explain observations, also completely change the properties of BGK modes [Ng and Bhattacharjee, Phys. Rev. Lett., 95, 245004 (2005); Ng, Bhattacharjee and Skiff, Phys. Plasmas, 13, 055903 (2006)]. <br/><br/>In this project, the nonlinear dynamics of Landau damping and 2D/3D BGK modes in a weakly collisional plasma will be studied, by means of analysis as well as direct Boltzmann simulations with a Fokker-Planck type collision term. These studies will be carried out with increasing levels of realism and sophistication: starting with 1D Boltzmann simulations for the Landau damping problem, and following up with 1D spatial and 2D velocity space simulations for the symmetric higher dimensional BGK modes. Results of the studies will be compared with laboratory and space observations. This is a subject of broad interest because, as is well known, the underlying physics of Vlasov equation/Landau damping/BGK modes not only applies in high temperature  plasmas, as in laboratory experiments and space/astrophysical environments, but also exists in similar form in many different physical systems, e.g., beams in particle accelerators, galactic dynamics, ocean waves, Bose-Einstein condensates, trapped electron devices. The codes developed in this project will be available for the scientific community for other research. This project also involves significant interactions between theory and experiments, such as those performed by Prof. F. Skiff at the University of Iowa as well as numerous observations of solitary wave-type structures in space. This project will support a graduate student, and partially for a postdoctoral research fellow, who will also receive mentoring activities. Results from this project will be published in scientific journals, and summarized in a website. <br/><br/>This project will also allow supported researchers to participate in education and outreach activities around the University of Alaska Fairbanks area, such as those organized through the Public Information and Education Outreach Office of the Geophysical Institute, or those coordinated by the UAF Science  education Outreach Network."

Dr. Carling will be  working in collaboration with Dr. Philip O'Brien of the  School of Biological and Environmental Science at Murdoch  University located in Perth, Western Australia. The research   will focus on the genetic and molecular characterization of  Rhizoctonia solani, a parasitic plant fungi.

R.solani is divided into a number of subspecific groups called  anastomosis groups (AG) based upon the ability of hyphae of  related isolates to interconnect.  Research will be conducted on  collections of R. solani AG-3 that are virulent on potato and  tobacco plants and on heterokaryotic and homokaryotic isolates of  AG-8 that are either virulent or avirulent on the roots of  potato and wheat plants.  Dr. O'Brien and his colleagues have  been studying the molecular biology of R. solani and have  perfected a technique of generating homokaryotic isolates with a  protoplast procedure used in studying mating and incompatibility  systems.  Dr. Carling and his group have been active in the  characterization of new anastomosis groupings.  The study  brings together the complementary skills of the two research  groups.

Some of the most dramatic and technologically harmful aspects of this space weather occur in the ionosphere from mid-latitudes to the polar cap. The HF radar technique as implemented in the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) has demonstrated its value for making always-on, global-scale observations of ionospheric space weather and for advancing our understanding of the underlying geophysical processes. The participants in the international SuperDARN collaboration jointly operate networks in both the northern and southern hemispheres that now total 35 radars. Over the past five years the scope of SuperDARN has greatly increased with the NSF-sponsored construction of a mid-latitude chain of radars that spans the United States.  The collaboration on this award counts Virginia Tech as the lead-PI institution and Dartmouth College, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory as collaborating PI institutions. Significant benefits are expected from combining efforts and sharing expertise within this consortium that brings together, for the first time, all the NSF-funded SuperDARN groups within one organizational structure.  The award will ensure the continued operation of the 11 radars in North America that this group collectively is responsible for.  The US SuperDARN group also provides leadership of the international SuperDARN collaboration.  The radar measurements of the rapidly expanding SuperDARN network constitute a unique dataset that will support many important science investigations within a wide range of Geospace research areas.  In addition, the project will support the education and training of students and postdocs at all of the participating institutions as well as many others in a broad  variety of scientific, engineering, and team-building aspects of space science. <br/><br/>SuperDARN utilizes coherent backscatter techniques to track the ExB drift of ionospheric plasma, and in its standard mode of operation, each radar measures the line-of-sight plasma velocity at 75 ranges along each of 16 beam directions covering an area of about 3500 km in range and about 56 degrees in azimuth. The radars operate continuously, 24 hours per day and 7 days per week and deliver images of the high-latitude convection pattern with a two-minute time resolution. The network of SuperDARN radars constitutes a unique global-scale instrument to observe and understand the system-level effects of solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and to study space weather in the ionosphere.  By providing direct measurements of convection velocities over large regions, SuperDARN provides the best means available to determine ionospheric convection patterns.  Through this award operations of the system will be secured for the next five years, including both routine maintenance as well as some necessary technical upgrades.  The measurements will be provided together with advanced and improved analysis tools to enable and facilitate research by the broader community to make major advances on a broad range of science questions at the forefront of ionospheric research.  Planned topics of investigations include: magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, improved models of storm-time ionospheric plasma convection, ionosphere-thermosphere interactions, magnetic conjugacy studies, and ionospheric plasma instabilities and irregularities."

NSF, acknowledging the key role of information technology (IT) in Earth System Science, is supporting this proposal by the BGCCRF operator, the Barrow Arctic Science Consortium (BASC), to design and install the facility's information architecture. This project delivers modern IT infrastructure and an approach to instrumentation that is based around the new BGCCRF with a wireless radius of about 10 miles around the BGCCRF. This wireless radius focuses on supporting work in the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO), on coastal sea-ice, and research vessels offshore. BASC is drawing on faculty at the University of Cincinnati (UC) and IT professionals at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) to meet these needs. The IT effort here will support the approximately 30-40 active NSF research projects as well as other agency projects in the Barrow area. The proposal includes UC and UAF working jointly on the infrastructure and instrumentation plan, with UC focusing on developing a wireless radius of about 10 miles around the BGCCRF. This proposal covers the wireless radius and the solid cyberinfrastructure of the new science support facility. To develop the plan implemented here, BASC convened three national science community meetings on IT planning. Two focused on user needs assessment. The 1st, in Williamsburg in 2003, identified funding agencies' (NOAA, NSF, NASA, DOE, etc.) scientists' needs. Convened by UC faculty, two dozen network engineers, federal agency representatives and academic IT experts attended, targeting federal agency bandwidth, acceptable use policy and IT security requirements. The 2nd meeting (Boulder 2004) assessed end-user (scientist) needs. Several dozen current and potential Barrow researchers attended. A straw person information architecture was developed from these meetings, then reviewed, refined and vetted at a 3rd meeting held in Barrow in January 2006, that took into account more recent and definite construction and budget constraints. This project slightly modifies those recommendations to keep the overall project costs reasonable while meeting the essential needs of the research community in the Barrow area. The improved IT capability in the Barrow area will better enable wireless connectivity to instrumentation and data flow back to researchers' home institutions as well as improve local network stability and connectivity to the internet."

The researchers seek to resolve primary questions about this hydrogeologic system through the installation of new geophysical and geochemical monitoring equipment during a summer 2004 expedition of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) and through later submersible visits to the borehole observatories to download data and recover fluid samples.  To monitor pressure and temperature, CORKs that permit isolation of multiple zones within the formation will be deployed in two existing Juan de Fuca boreholes and a new IODP borehole.  The data acquired in these closely-spaced boreholes will constrain the three-dimensional hydrogeologic structure of highly hetereogeneous and fractured oceanic crust.  Following the CORK installations in mid-2004, the researchers will use a submersible platform to retrieve data and fluid samples during visits in 2005 and 2007.  During these submersible operatins, data will also be downloaded  from 3 other existing CORKs in the area (ODP holes 1024C, 1025C, and 857D).<br/>"

The isotopic studies will include the stable isotope systematics of carbon-bearing species (CH4 and CO2) and the light noble gases (He, Ne, Ar).   By developing sampling and deployment strategies for two complementary instruments -the Mass SURFER which measures concentrations in-situ together with the CA meter which records fluid flux rates and preserves samples for later analyses - the team will make new estimates of the rate of loss to the ocean and atmosphere for a number of elements via this important, but hitherto largely neglected, pathway.   A major focus of this study will be development of and inter-comparison between the two instrument packages.  For the most part, this development will occur in the laboratory and at a number of well-characterized fluids in the Monterey Bay region.   The unique analytical capability of these technologies holds great potential for future studies in margin and other submarine environments.<br/><br/>In addition to development work along the Pacific coast of the United States, the chief scientific focus area will be the Costa Rica margin, an area identified by the MARGINS community as one of two designated study areas particularly amenable to a multi-disciplinary approach.  The research team plans to investigate the forearc region between the Nicoya and Osa peninsulas where subducting seamounts have disrupted the forearc and allowed seepage of fluids along normal faults. The key questions that will be addressed with this study are the nature and sources of these leaking fluids and whether that there are temporal variations in both flow rate and/or chemistry. <br/><br/>The longer-term objectives of the project are to quantify the rate of elemental loss to the ocean and atmosphere via this active fore-arc margin and to determine if seepage variability and earthquakes are linked.   The investigators believe that this the study will afford a unique opportunity to understand the factors controlling the release and movement of carbon associated with the subduction process and to place quantitative constraints on the flux of volatiles from this vital yet poorly studied segment of the terrestrial carbon cycle.<br/><br/>"

They plan to study organic and inorganic plant remains from Hierakonpolis in a contribution to palaeoethnobotany of Egypt.  The project is to foster partnership with Egyptian scientific departments, provide research tools and training required to undertake macro and micro archaeobotanical research and integrate that with archaeological collection strategies in order to explore a range of information deriving from botanical material from the archaeological site of Hierakonpolis, Egypt. Egyptian regulations forbid the export of any archaeological materials.  <br/><br/>Intellectual merit: 1) Understanding of human interaction with plants in Ancient Egypt is based on inferential sources such as tooth wear, food offerings, and botanical remains retrieved from archaeological sediments. The recovery of a significant sample of well-preserved ingested food remains in the abdominal cavities of ""working-class"" human burials at the site of Hierakonpolis (c.3800-3400BC) allows a rare opportunity to test various assumptions on subsistence, environment and climate at this formative stage in Ancient Egyptian civilization with non-circumstantial evidence. The extraction of the full range of information from this material requires an integrated approach to the analysis, which includes the identification of organic macro-remains (e.g., fruits, seeds) as well as inorganic micro-remains, i.e., phytoliths. Fossil phytolith analysis is a new tool for palaeoethnobotanical research in Egypt. It holds great promise for recovering previously inaccessible information. 2) Phytolith studies can also reveal evidence captured in calculus on the teeth of humans and animals to provide information on longer-term diet. This in turn can be compared with observations derived from other dental dietary indicators and the evidence of consumed or offered foods. 3) The integrated archaeobotanical analysis of the working-class burials is further enhanced by the opportunity to analyze data from the contemporaneous burials of the elite and contrast both data sets with material from a domestic structure of the same time period. Together these analyses present an unprecedented body of evidence to assess human/plant interaction at the dawn of Egyptian civilization, a time of dynamic social and economic development that has been linked to climatic change.  The project is designed to allow the collection of useful information while developing integrated collection strategies, expanding research facilities and training of students. <br/><br/>Broader impact: 1) the development of a dedicated archaeobotanical research laboratory in Egypt of use to the international botanical, archaeological and geological communities; 2) train and provide hands-on experience for US and Egyptian senior scientists and students; 3) create guidelines for the collection of archaeobotanical remains to be distributed in English and Arabic, as the rise in water table due to increased land reclamation activities all over Egypt is making archaeological remains an endangered and even diminishing resource; 4) increase understanding for the scholarly and general public about the environment and climate change in the past and its effect on lifeways: how we learn about these aspects and how they are inter-related. The results will be published in peer reviewed archaeological and archaeobotanical journals, and updates and reports for the lay audience will be placed in the Hierakonpolis expedition's Nekhen News newsletter and on its website www.hierakonpolis.org and that of the American Institute of Archaeology www.archaeology.org. The archaeo-botanical material will be permanently curated in Egypt for further study.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.<br/>"

Aerosol transport to this region probably has a large influence on cloud formation and microphysical properties because of the region's meteorological isolation, lack of local aerosol sources, and the pristine air quality conditions encountered for much of the year. Climate change promises to be particularly evident in polar regions, and Arctic clouds may be particularly susceptible to the effects of global warming, thus providing the potential for additional climatic feedbacks. Our knowledge of atmospheric conditions must be improved as recognized by the upcoming International Polar Year research effort.   A comprehensive remote sensing measurement program from the University of Alaska Fairbanks Arctic Facility for Atmospheric Remote Sensing (AFARS, at 64.86 deg N and 147.84 deg W) will be conducted to lessen our uncertainties about Arctic cloud and aerosol properties, and particularly to examine aerosol indirect effects on clouds. AFARS has three polarization lidars operating at 0.532, 0.694, 1.06 and 1.574 micrometers, a 0.607 micrometer nitrogen Raman channel, a polarimetric Doppler W-band (3.2-mm) radar, and a suite of ultraviolet, visible, and infrared radiometers. As in previous midlatitude studies, AFARs observations will be coordinated with observations by Earth Observing System A-train satellites during overpasses.<br/><br/>The specific goals are to use multiple remote sensors, both ground- and space-based, to characterize the macrophysical and microphysical properties of mid- and high-level clouds in our region and to compare them to their midlatitude counterparts; study aerosol intrusions into the normally clean Arctic environment protected by the barrier of Polar Fronts, and at the same time improve aerosol characterization through combined multi-wavelength depolarization, Stokes parameterization, and Raman lidar methods; more intensively study recent findings that aerosols, such as transported Asian dust, volcanic dust, and forest fire smoke, are indirectly affecting clouds; and test the ability of satellite methods to characterize the clouds and aerosols we observe.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this program is that it matches a unique ensemble of university-based remote sensing instruments with satellite data in a largely unstudied part of the globe, offering the chance for fundamental new discoveries. The broader impacts arise through student and postdoctoral scientist involvement. New scientists will be trained in the remote sensing arena.

The research program is interdisciplinary, using paleomagnetism,  geochronology, geochemistry, seismology and structural geology to  study the Mesozoic to Cenozoic tectonic history of noptheastern  Russia from the edge of the Siberian platform up to, and  including, the Okhotsk-Chukotka volcanic belt (OCVB).  The study  area includes the zone of Mesozoic accretion of terranes of both  Arctic and Pacific origins and the present-day plate boundary  between North America (NA) and Eurasia (EU).  So far, this  cooperative project has detected an age progression among  Mesozoic granites, identified a widespread paleomagnetic  overprint in the northwestern Kolyma Structural Loop (KSL), and  obtained previously published paleomagnetic data for the region.  Earthquake focal mechanisms, based on regional and teleseismic  data, reveal that crustal shortening in the region, driven by the  opening of the Arctic Ocean is being relieved by the extrusion of  the Okhotsk (OK) plate to the southeast.   To expand  understanding of the KSL, this project will focus on its  southeastern end, where formations similar to those studied in  the northeastern part of the loop turn from a southeasterly  strike to a northeasterly one.  This region also lies along the  NA-OK plate boundary and fault traces and seismically generated  features are visible in low resolution satellite images.  The  next phase of work will involve two transects by NEISRI and the  YSC along the Kolyma and Indigirka Rivers, and analysis the  samples collected.  These transects cross the Kular-Nera slate  belt, the Omulevka composite terrane, the Il'in-Tas formation, or  their along-strike equivalents.  These units represent,  according  to one model, the Late Jurassic forearc, arc, and back-arc  deposits of the Uyandina-Yasachnaya island arc which was located  on or near the edge of the Kolyma-Omolon superterrane (K-OS);  this model, however, is still open to considerable debate,  especially relating to the polarity of subduction.  The primary  objectives here are to determine the age and polarity of the  Uyandina arc, the relationship between the K-OS and the Viliga  shelf terrane, the extent of the paleomagnetic overprint, whether  oroclinal bending occurs, the age and paleolatitude of the Late  Cretaceous OCVB, the detailed tectonics and location of the NA-OK  plate boundary, and the crustal structure of the region.  Resolution of these problems will aid in constraining the  tectonic evolution of northeast Russia, which has implications  for the tectonics of the North Pacific and the Arctic Ocean.  In  particular, this work will aid in determining the timing and  methodology of the isolation of the Arctic basin which has impact  on paleoclimatology.  The seismic studies will help in  constraining the amount of crustal thickening resulting from  compression and aid in wave propagation studies and nuclear test-  ban monitoring."

This award will be supported with funds from the Population Ecology Program in the Division of Biology and Arctic Natural Sciences Program. The effects of future climatic change on arctic species are a source of great uncertainty and concern and the Arctic has experienced large changes in climate since the last glacial cycle.  Therefore, the study of biotic responses to the previous perturbations may provide important evidence of how the genetic diversity, diet, and geographic range of arctic species will be altered by future global climate change. Using DNA analysis, the Principal Investigators will examine the history of genetic diversity in the barren-ground caribou and an extinct arctic horse based on samples from three localities in Beringia. Bones recovered from the permafrost are an excellent source of ancient DNA and can be 14C dated. Two recent genetic studies analyzed DNA sequences from brown bear bones entombed in the arctic permafrost and found evidence of three distinct genetic epochs over the past 40,000 years, each marked by population turnover events. These previously unrecognized epochs are defined by DNA sequences from specimens older than 35 thousand (ka) BP, from specimens 21 to 10 ka BP, and by sequences from modern populations.   Paleoclimate studies provide evidence that population turnover between these periods may be explained by changing climate relating to the mid-Wisconsin interstadial, the last glacial maximum, and the Holocene. However, paleoenvironmental data are sparse and inconclusive and these genetic patterns have not been verified in other species. As herbivores, caribou, and horses represent a different trophic level from brown bears and both species specialize on consuming different types of vegetation (tundra and grass-steppe, respectively).  The Principal Investigators predict that ecosystem-wide climate change unfavorable to large herbivores and their predators would result in synchronous cycles of population turnover in both species across all three localities. These changes should match those previously observed in the brown bear and gray wolf. Similar regional or local ecosystem change would be manifest as synchronous cycles in a subset of localities. In contrast, differing patterns of genetic change in the two species would imply a change in the tundra/forest dominance or the presence of new species-specific competitors and/or predators. In either case, the study will provide important evidence of the potential role of climate change on genetic diversity in arctic mammals. <br/> <br/>The Principal Investigators will identify specific agents of environmental change and reconstruct past arctic environments through study of three independent classes of environmental surrogates in all three locations. First, they will develop stable isotope profiles for the remains analyzed in the DNA study. These profiles will serve as proxies for regional climate change and allow changing animal diets to be inferred. Second, they will use plant material imbedded in the teeth of herbivores to reconstruct the changes in local flora utilized by the two herbivores. Third, they will utilize existing pollen records and other paleoenvironmental data to reconstruct the regional vegetation and general climate during periods of observed genetic turnover. Importantly, they will 14C date 300 bones from the two herbivore species across Beringia which will place their results in a temporal context that will allow integration with existing climate data. <br/> <br/>Boarder Impact: All data will be placed in the public domain for future studies as new <br/>techniques and questions arise. Additionally, this research will train a group of students in cutting-edge, interdisciplinary research that incorporates genetics, pollen analysis, high-resolution radiocarbon dating, and stable isotope ecology. <br/>"

At El Chichon, these investigations will involve studying the effusive volcanic products exposed at the volcano in order to identify any separate magma batches, detect closed- versus open-system magmatic behavior, track magma bodies and their interactions through time, and identify changes in magma storage conditions (pressure, temperature, volatile contents) through time.  These objectives will be met by analyzing stratigraphically controlled samples for argon isotope, and combining those with textural, and compositional variations in single mineral crystals, to determine magma conditions at the time of eruption. A more detailed analysis of the evolution and eruptive history of El Chichon activity will allow a better understanding of the relationships between magma systems and resulting eruptions of this Mexican volcano.  Such understanding will enhance our ability to forecast its future eruptive behavior.

The fire-prone areas of Alaska are primarily in the interior boreal forest region. The discontinuous nature of the permafrost distribution tends to promote a mosaic of vegetation types with dense forests of fire-prone black spruce and thick organic layers developing in permafrost areas that have not burned in recent history. Fires also occur, on a lower frequency, in the treeless tundra regions of the Seward Peninsula and Yukon Kuskokwim Delta. Although the cause is uncertain, fire records demonstrate a marked positive trend in the numbers of fires over the last 50 years on the Seward Peninsula. It is obvious that these fires will have marked impacts on surface energy balance, soil moisture dynamics and permafrost thermal regime, but these changes and their interactions have not been quantified in tundra regions. The PIs have operated numerous meteorological stations with extensive soil instrumentation in four locations on the Seward Peninsula and near Ivotuk for four years. One of these stations was destroyed in a severe fire last fall, presenting a devastating loss of instrumentation and at the same time, a unique opportunity to document quantifiably how this system will change following a fire. The damaged equipment was replaced within a few months to maintain a nearly continuous record of measurements in the burn area. This work would maintain six meteorological stations currently operating in that area. The significant annual variation previously documented at these sites necessitates maintenance of all stations to permit characterization of changes due to the fire as opposed to those due to temporal variations in climate. In addition, the group will utilize this opportunity to investigate the impacts of tundra fire on the surface energy balance and subsurface thermal regime. These studies will attempt to characterize the subtle influence of burn severity on both short-term impacts and consequences for long-term recovery. They will maintain the series of meteorological stations to document changes in the surface energy balance and collect distributed measurements of active layer thickness on the existing 1 km2 CALM grid (half of which was burned) to enable comparisons with measurements collected during the previous four years. They will supplement these measurements with other distributed measurements of subsurface moisture and temperature to characterize the impacts of wildfire, particularly with respect to burn severity. <br/> <br/>Intellectual Merit: While wildfires in the boreal forest regions of the world have been extensively studied, little is known about the impacts of tundra fires on the local ecosystem, regional climate or the permafrost and hydrologic regime. The permafrost is quite close to the surface due to the insulative capability of the thick tundra mat. How this system responds to such a drastic disturbance has not been rigorously studied. The existing climatologic network within this basin provides the basis of immediately and economically documenting the impacts and the process of recovery. Quantitative information on these processes is very important in light of the recent changes in climate and hydrologic regimes. <br/> <br/>Broader Impacts: Wildfire is probably the dominant agent controlling land surface change in Arctic and subarctic regions. The dramatic impacts immediately following a fire are quite obvious, but the longer-term effects are probably more important in their influence upon regional and global climate dynamics. This research will document those impacts and project long term trajectories of recovery. This understanding is critically important for correct parameterization of dynamic vegetation models and the climate simulations that consider a changing land surface. <br/>"

The research is critical because Arctic and Subarctic communities in the US and beyond represent some of the world's least secure communities with respect to provision of food, energy, and water. A systems approach acknowledging the linkages between food, energy, and water security holds great promise for developing integrated solutions. Such communities are ideally suited as model systems for the FEW nexus as they are geographically isolated, often inaccessible by roads, highly dependent on imported FEW resources, and often dependent upon isolated microgrids for distribution of local power. Due to this isolation, links between FEW infrastructure components are more readily observed compared to those in larger, interconnected communities elsewhere, and perturbations to the system can be more readily predicted. While introducing renewable energy infrastructure to the local microgrid in such communities could potentially enhance energy security by reducing their dependence upon imported fossil fuels, this introduction could also adversely impact the stability of the microgrids themselves or variably impact the linked infrastructure and processes contributing to food and water security. In pursuing a comprehensive approach that directly engages community stakeholders as well as researchers, the work seeks to ensure that any impacts to food, energy, and water security imposed by introducing renewable energy generation infrastructure to Arctic and Subarctic communities are universally positive. <br/><br/>This research project represents a series of tasks addressing two key research questions: 1) What are the direct and indirect linkages between renewable energy generation and local drivers of FEW security in Arctic and Subarctic communities? 2) To what extent can combinations of renewable energy generation and FEW-related infrastructure energy loads be optimized to enhance FEW security in Arctic and Subarctic communities? The project derives expertise from two US universities, one Canadian university, three rural Alaska communities, and a host of associated stakeholders across Alaska. Key tasks include 1) engaging communities and developing place-based FEW metrics; 2) measuring existing FEW flows and feedbacks within the communities; 3) evaluating new technologies capable of impacting the local FEW nexus; 4) developing energy distribution models to optimize on-grid infrastructure components; 5) evaluating those optimization scenarios in the broader framework of the local FEW nexus using the previously-defined metrics; and 6) communicating results in diverse formats tailored for local residents and the broader scientific community. While analytical tools for optimizing grid configurations in the presence of renewable sources are available, they are designed for time-averaged performance and do not account for short-term fluctuations in sources or demands. This project capitalizes on those short-term fluctuations so that excess energy, when available, will be diverted to dispatchable loads serving FEW-enhancing objectives. Novel energy distribution models and controls are being developed to operate on timescales necessary to optimize the performance of intermittent renewable sources powering FEW-enhancing dispatchable loads. In addition to the advances offered in renewable energy management and control, the broader process represents an innovative approach to evaluating the FEW nexus. By framing the local FEW nexus around the infrastructure linked by the grid system, this work captures a thin cross section of the nexus that can be readily measured and manipulated. In linking off-grid FEW processes to the more concrete on-grid processes, MicroFEWS offers a novel and potentially scalable approach to understanding FEW dynamics in the Arctic, Subarctic, and beyond."

The fault has a long and complicated history over the past 65 million years. Due to its complex and curved geometry, there are portions of the fault where the motion of the blocks is oblique to the fault trend resulting in the formation of basins and fold and thrust belts. In this project, a research team from Purdue University, Syracuse University, and the University of Alaska are studying a portion of this fault to better understand the factors that control how these crustal blocks deform. They are particularly interested in determining whether the strength of the blocks on opposite sides of the fault or the geometry of the fault controls deformation. There are many large active fault systems like the Denali around the world and it is important to understand how these behave since many are capable of generating significant earthquakes such as the 2002 magnitude 7.9 earthquake on the Denali Fault. Additional desired societal outcomes of the study include full participation underrepresented minorities in STEM through support of Native American students and researchers and outreach to Alaskan Native American communities plus development of a globally competitive STEM workforce through undergraduate and graduate student training.<br/><br/>Transitional zones between primarily strike-slip motion and oblique convergence are a common feature along strike-slip faults. Deformation along these transpressive faults is controlled in part by both the obliquity of the applied stress and fault geometry (variation in strike and dip), and rheologic contrasts across the faults on the lithospheric- and crustal-scale. These transpressive fault regions offer insight into how strain is accommodated and also how the broad zones defined by thrust belts and foreland basins evolve along strike-slip fault systems as crustal blocks are translated along regions of varying obliquity. The east-central Denali fault segment has a generally simple geometry of unvarying strike and dip for about 120 km, lies between two large composite terranes of contrasting strength, and has a documented history of vertical tectonics during the Cenozoic. Thus, it serves as a natural laboratory to study the affect of these two distinct boundary conditions on the history of deformation along this active strike-slip fault system. This project will examine the importance of fault geometry relative to contrasts in lithospheric strength across faults on the heterogeneity of deformation along the eastern corner of the Denali fault. The Denali fault in this region changes from dominantly strike-slip to a transpressive regime. The competing hypotheses (strength vs. geometry) on how strain is accommodated and deformation occurs along this transpressive fault system will be tested by integrating thermochronology, geochronology, structural, and basin analysis studies. Detrital (modern river sediment and from strata) and bedrock thermochronology (K-feldspar 40Ar/39Ar, apatite fission-track and apatite (U-Th)/He) north and south of the Denali fault will track spatial and temporal patterns of exhumation in conjunction with basin development along the fault as proxies and recorders for deformational processes. 40Ar/39Ar and fission track tephrachronology, palynology, and vitrinite reflectance will delineate timing of basin subsidence, inversion, thermal history, and shortening rates. 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb geochronology on clasts from conglomerate and sand samples will provide insight into paleo-drainage patterns and displacement of sediment sources from basins along the fault. Together, these integrated data will yield important new constraints on the relative contributions two common boundary conditions play in heterogeneous deformation patterns along a continental strike-slip fault system."

A test-bed environment for energy-efficiency and performance evaluation of reconfigurable hierarchical networks of sensors will be established at the Center for Nanosensor Technology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Another anticipated benefit of such intelligent surveillance sensor networks is the extension of the same principles to everyday applications of distributed sensor networks.  <br/><br/>"

Being heavily influenced by ice, snow and permafrost dynamics, the Yukon River Basin, a pristine river basin, is sensitive to environmental and climate change. With up to 50% of the world's soil organic carbon stored in the northern region, the role of arctic/subarctic rivers in the remobilization of organic carbon and thus marine and global carbon cycles is far more important than previously recognized.  Due to the Yukon River's remoteness and the extreme weather conditions, the composition and reactivity of organic carbon species entering the ocean via the Yukon remain largely unknown and the riverine carbon export flux is poorly quantified.  <br/>Observations will include phase partitioning of organic carbon between dissolved, colloidal and particulate phases, and concentrations, optical properties, molecular and isotopic (d13C, d15N and ?14C) composition and reactivity of size fractionated organic carbon.  Field and laboratory experiments will also be carried out to examine the extent to which organic carbon fractionates during ice formation and how the fractionation drives carbon partitioning and transformation.  This project will be among the first to combine both molecular-level and basin-scale observations to understand temporal and spatial variations in composition and flux of organic carbon species in a large but pristine and less anthropogenically influenced river basin.  The proposed research will provide valuable data for comparative studies between drainage basins, and provide inputs for and contribute effectively to the integrated carbon cycle program and model development, and the understanding of the environmental impacts from a changing climate.<br/>"

Traditional oceanographic strategies for the sampling and study of marine particles often involve various forms of direct collection. However, these approaches are severely limited in their ability to provide particle data at high spatial and temporal resolutions, and to determine the in situ structure of these small and delicate particles. For these reasons, in situ imaging of particles and plankton is rapidly becoming an important tool for the study of marine particle dynamics and the ocean's biological pump, as these instruments enable the high-resolution and non-destructive assessment of particle size, concentration, and morphology. This project will facilitate the initial testing, operational development, and utilization of the Underwater Vision Profiler 5 (UVP), an advanced in situ imaging system. Deployments of the UVP in the Arctic Ocean will generate a new dataset that will be used to explore the nature of the biological, chemical, and physical factors that influence the cycling of particles and carbon in this region. The award supports two students at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF), one Master's and one undergraduate, to participate in research related to particle cycling in the Arctic ocean. The PI and the students will use in situ imaging equipment to study the links between the particle size distribution and the sinking flux of particulate organic matter. The cycling of particulate matter in the Arctic Ocean is not well understood, and this research will enhance of our understanding of particle dynamics and carbon cycling in a region that is currently undergoing rapid environmental change.<br/><br/>This award will advance the methodological capabilities of the UAF laboratory, begin a new research endeavor into the dynamics of marine particles and carbon cycling of the Arctic Ocean, and engage two students in research that is relevant to the Arctic."

Such equations arise in several linearized models of chatter instability in high-speed machining, including milling with arbitrary immersion level and turning with modulated speed or impedance, as well as in other important engineering and scientific applications.  In addition, the local nonlinear bifurcation analysis for the full nonlinear models is also performed.  These objectives are accomplished by combining some important topics and recent methodologies in high-speed machining, symbolic computation, and nonlinear dynamics into a single research thrust.  By incorporating time-delay into an existing symbolic algorithm for stability analysis of time-periodic systems, the stability boundaries (for example, in the two-parameter plane of spindle speed and depth of cut) which predict chatter in machining operations are obtained analytically.  This task constitutes the first phase of the work plan and represents a significant design tool since, given a value of one parameter (say spindle speed), the critical value of the other (cutting depth) is easily obtained.  Consequently, this approach provides an attractive alternative to designers who often try to operate in a narrow spindle speed range on the stability chart while retaining as high a cutting speed as possible. Since recent research on chatter instability in turning indicates that linear stability analysis alone is inadequate and should be accompanied by a full nonlinear analysis, the second phase of the work plan, namely the analytical bifurcation analysis for the time-periodic milling models, is accomplished by combining existing computational tools for time-periodic systems with the Hopf bifurcation algorithm for DDEs.  The results thus obtained allows the determination of the critical parameter set for loss of global stability and the domain of attraction just prior to loss of local stability.  Experimental validation of the theoretical results is made by collaborators at NIST.  This project fosters cross-disciplinary education in engineering and mathematics through training graduate students and bringing current research and practice (including symbolic computation) into undergraduate classrooms.<br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>          <br/> <br/>"

As the piece that does not fit the simple ?windshield wiper? model for the Mesozoic opening of this basin, it figures prominently in all tectonic models proposed for the opening of the Amerasian Basin. Funds are provided to use multi-channel seismic (MCS) reflection techniques to test these hypotheses. By imaging the sedimentary section and tracing the continuity of structure, crustal thickness and stratigraphy across the edges of this high-standing continental block, it should be possible to distinguish between strike-slip, extensional and compressional boundaries. By tying the basinal stratigraphy to well-dated sediments on the Chukchi Shelf, it will be possible to propagate seismic stratigraphic age control into the Arctic Ocean basin to date the extensional dissection of the Borderland and lay the groundwork for scientific drilling.<br/><br/>The four edges of the Chukchi Borderland present distinct scientific opportunities as well as possibilities for broader impact. Two particular edges have been selected as offering the best pay-off, although only one may be surveyed given the limited ship days available to this project:  <br/>The transition from the Chukchi Shelf to the Chukchi Borderland ? Potential fields data (eg. gravity and magnetic anomaly data) suggest a discontinuity between the North American continental crust of the Chukchi Shelf and the adjacent Chukchi Borderland crust of uncertain affinity. In addition to directly observing any structures that define the transition, collecting the proposed data would also make it possible to link the substantial historical 2-D MCS grid on the shelf and the age control there to the stratigraphy of the Arctic Ocean. This is the least challenging area for sea ice. This region should be open water during the August-September period.<br/>The northern edge of the Chukchi Borderland ? Bathymetry data appear to show extensional structures from the interior basins within the Borderland plunging below the sediment cover off the continental high.

This velocity cannot be directly measured with the necessary accuracy and spatial resolution to allow accurate estimation of ice mass flux to the oceans.  What can be measured is the surface speed of the glacier.  The remaining challenge is to use mathematical models to infer basal velocities from the measured surface velocities.

The TOBEC body composition analyzer is a new instrument for noninvasive  measurement of body composition in live subjects and provides an opportunity to examine temporal variation in an individual's fat and protein reserves. The Soxhlet apparatus would be used to calibrate the TOBEC technique and extract stored lipids for further analyses.  Separation and quantitation of lipid classes would be accomplished with the TLC/FID system, and the energy content of storage compounds will be measured with the isoperibol oxygen bomb  calorimeter.     Determination of body composition is a fundamental method for evaluating physical condition and nutritional status of animals. Lipid and lean mass are measures of energy and protein reserves and, presumably, of fitness during periods of food shortage, dormancy, or negative energy ba lance.  Scientists at the Institute of Arctic Biology are engaged in several research projects that test the adaptive significance of fat reserves for endotherms living in high latitude environments.  Procurement of the above pieces of equipment will greatly enhance existing research projects at the Institute that are described in this proposal, and will provide many opportunities for new projects.  In addition, the new instrumentation will significantly improve instruction and research of undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.                 9         9     (    Times New Roman    Symbol  & Arial                                 ""             h            E                        =    abstract    Deseree King, BIR Deseree King, BIR               X1       ~CRD3E17TMP            X1       ~CAL1E3FTMP           l:L       ~CRD1809TMP           p:L       9317916  Roby   This Equipment Proposal requests funds to purchase (1) total body electrical conductivity (TOBEC) body compositi    9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       d                           9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    !         !

The work builds on an ongoing study at Siple Dome, West Antarctica and takes advantage of collaborations with European scientists and access to the Dome C borehole to make measurements of sonic velocity.  The intellectual merit of the project is that a better understanding of how fabric preserves past climate information can improve models of the ice flow near ice core sites and the interpreta-tion of ice core data (particularly paleo-accumulation), and it may allow us to extract climate information directly from fabric data.  In addition, because ice deformation is sensitive to the orientation of crystals, ice flow patterns are sensitive to the fabric. Thus, variations in the fabric between glacial and interglacial ice can affect how ice deforms and how fabric in the ice sheet develops.  The Dome C site is particularly important for answering these questions, because the ice core shows evidence of eight glacial cycles, not just one as found at Siple Dome or the Greenland sites.  The research will improve the understanding of the proxy relationship between sonic-velocity data and fabric; will help to model the pattern of ice flow caused by the fabric variation between glacial and interglacial time periods using these data, existing ice core chemistry and existing and new thin section data, improved surface strain data, and borehole deformation data; and will help to better understand the positive feedback mechanism that enhances fabric (and corresponding rheological) variability through a focused study of several climate transitions and the associated fabric changes.  Borehole compressional-wave sonic-velocity will be measured which will complement the sonic-velocity data that already exist for boreholes in Greenland and West Antarctica.  These will be the first sonic-velocity measurements in East Antarctica and the first measurements that extend for more than a single glacial/interglacial transition.   The project will ultimately contribute to better interpretation of ice core records for both paleoclimate studies and for ice flow history, both of which connect to the broader questions of the role of ice in the climate system. This project will also strengthen the international collaborations within the paleoclimate and ice sheet modeling communities. This project will partially support a graduate student at the University of Alaska Fairbanks who is currently working on modeling ice including anisotropy and it will support the growth of a young scientist through a Post-Doc position. This Post Doc will gain important experience collaborating with the EPICA scientists in studying the climate-fabric relationship. Erin Pettit is active in field-science education for high school students, under-graduates, teachers, and adults. This project will help support the continued development and enhancement of Girls on Ice a program that encourages young women to explore science and the natural world.<br/><br/>"

As such models involve unobserved, spatially-correlated variables, modeling these processes will require the development of flexible variogram models that will conform to a wide variety of random processes.  These are approached through process-convolution models.  The investigators are considering a variety of special cases, including cokriging, generalized (hierarchical) spatial models, spatial compositional data and Poisson process models.  They are exploring several computational approaches, including generalized estimating equations, MCMC and expectation-maximization.  They are also identifying spectral, sparse matrix and other approaches to reduce the computational burden of the analysis.  The software they are developing will allow researchers in many fields to analyze multivariable spatial models.<br/><br/>Many research projects produce data that is associated with locations on a map.  For instance, an epidemiological study might consist of air pollution measurements taken at several fixed locations, along with the locations of households where an occupant was hospitalized with a pollution-related ailment.  In this case the air pollution measurement is a geostatistical variable (it could, in theory, be measured at any location on the map) and the households are a point process.  Other examples might include multiple geostatistical variables:  for instance, soil nitrogen and soil moisture measured at multiple locations in an ecological study.  Multiple geostatistical variables and point process variables are special cases of what are called multivariate or hierarchical spatial models.  The investigators are developing the general theory of these models, and are producing software that can efficiently analyze these models.  Dissemination of the software will allow the development of more sophisticated models for mapped data in many applied fields.<br/>"

Scientists track carbon on global, regional and local scales through annual carbon budgets which include both sources (income) and sinks (loss or expenditure). Organic carbon from watershed-draining rivers in the northern permafrost region is a critical component of the Arctic carbon budget. However, this carbon source is poorly represented in existing Arctic Ocean models. In the context of thawing permafrost, changes to the dissolved carbon supply in these Arctic rivers may influence ocean chemistry, as well as the availability of light and nutrients to plants in the Arctic marine environment. This fellowship will allow the PI and a graduate student to establish a research collaboration with the Computational Physics and Methods Group at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico to develop improved models of the dynamics of dissolved organic matter from rivers in Arctic Ocean and Earth system models. In addition, it will enable the PI to extend from shelf/basin ocean dynamics to ecosystem research focused on the land/ocean interface. This research will enable a better assessment of the impacts of a changing climate on the import and export of carbon in Arctic coastal regions. These improved models will be valuable resources for national and international investigators studying both the Arctic and global carbon dynamics. In addition to establishing the collaboration, the fellowship will enhance student training.

This project will develop improved representation of biogeochemical processes associated with riverine dissolved organic matter inputs to better assess the potential impacts of climate change to the biological pump and the sequestration of carbon in Arctic coastal regions. Existing observations of carbon in Arctic rivers will be used to develop model drivers corresponding to major Arctic rivers for incorporation into the global Earth system model developed by the High-Latitude Application and Testing of Global and Regional Climate Models team, based at LANL. This project will also yield an improved representation of dissolved organic carbon compounds within the biogeochemical component of LANL?s high latitude (HiLAT) model.  Model simulations will help researchers assess whether and how the strength of primary production and. The updated model will be used to help researches determine the impact of riverine DOM concentration on the strength of the biological pump in the Arctic coastal regions. Specifically, the variability in annual primary production, and the annual export of carbon to the benthos, over each Arctic shelf will be quantified for present and likely future riverine DOM input. Annual carbon budgets will be computed and used to determine likely future changes to the net flux of carbon on Arctic shelves, and thus the global carbon budget."

In common with other multinational initiatives in the International GEOTRACES Program, the goals of the U.S. Arctic expedition are to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions.  Some trace elements are essential to life, others are known biological toxins, and still others are important because they can be used as tracers of a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the sea.  Working alongside a multi-institutional team of ocean trace element experts, the sea ice group will focus its attention on the importance of ice as a reservoir that can accumulate trace elements in one locale and release them in another.  This project will also provide for the training and support of at least one graduate student at the University of Alaska Fairbanks Campus as well as multiple extramural public educational initiatives for local communities (including indigenous populations).<br/><br/>The U.S.GEOTRACES Arctic section will traverse waters impacted by sea ice processes, and exhibiting significant chemical and biological gradients. Sea ice of various ages and provenance will be encountered along the transect, presenting a unique opportunity to characterize trace elements of interest in sea ice with differing histories. The distribution of trace elements of interest in Arctic sea ice has not yet been determined, but it is expected to vary widely, and this study will investigate factors important in determining this variability, and thus important in the transport and distribution of trace elements in the Arctic environment. Access to ice floes will allow trace-metal-clean sampling of atmospheric deposition within snow cover, and characterization of surface waters in contact with sea ice.  The project will involve collection of trace-metal-clean samples from the sea ice environment to make high-resolution measurements of dissolved and particulate key trace elements from snow, sea ice and seawater underneath the ice, and to determine sea ice physical, and ancillary chemical characteristics in order to contribute towards the quantification of trace element input to the Arctic Ocean. Samples from the sea ice environment will be collected and homogenized for distribution to the scientific community. In fact, the development of a trace metal clean ice corer by the sea ice group will facilitate the characterization of sea ice chemistry, putting them in a unique position to collect, and distribute sea ice samples to the GEOTRACES community."

One of the most striking examples of alterations in metabolism occurs in fish in response to temperature. Because fish are ectotherms, with body temperatures equivalent to their environment, some species may experience body temperature changes as great as 15-20oC diurnally or seasonally, requiring adjustments in metabolism to maintain activity and swimming performance. Although metabolic remodeling in response to temperature has been well documented in several fish species, little is known about how it is regulated. While some components of the regulatory pathway are similar between fish and mammals, others differ, providing an opportunity to expand understanding of how metabolism is regulated. This project will identify the signaling pathway involved in temperature-induced changes in metabolism in the threespine stickleback fish. Stickleback are ideal for these studies because they inhabit thermally variable environments and their genome has been sequenced, making molecular biological studies more tractable compared to other species. High-school, undergraduate, and graduate students will participate in this research, obtaining training in physiology, biochemistry, and molecular biology. Native Alaskan high school students will be involved through independent studies as part of the Rural Alaskan High School Honors Institute, a six-week college preparatory program at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. Results from this research will provide a better understanding of how metabolism is regulated, a process essential to the health of all organisms.<br/><br/>This project investigates mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity, specifically the role of sirtuins, NAD+-dependent deacetylases, in driving metabolic reorganization in response to temperature in the threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus. The hypothesis will be tested that sirtuins activate c-MYC, a potent regulator of cell growth and metabolism, and that differences in chromatin packing among different tissues will affect c-MYC binding, resulting in tissue-specific metabolic remodeling that is reflected in the degree of thermal compensation at the organismal level in aerobic metabolic scope. Stickleback will be acclimated to three temperatures (5, 12, or 20oC) for 10 weeks. Maximal activities of key metabolic enzymes, mitochondrial respiration rates in permeabilized cells, aerobic metabolic scope, and levels of adenylates, sirtuins, and c-MYC will be quantified in liver and glycolytic and oxidative muscles. Levels of sirtuins will then be manipulated in vivo in animals at 12oC and these parameters quantified, along with the expression of select mitochondrial genes. Gene targets of c-MYC will be identified using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq), and a c-MYC promoter and reporter construct will be used to assess c-MYC DNA binding activity in vivo during thermal acclimation. This project will determine how changes in metabolism at the cellular level contribute to whole-organismal metabolic remodeling and identify components of the signaling cascade driving tissue-specific metabolic remodeling, creating an integrated understanding of metabolic remodeling that spans molecular, cellular and organismal levels. Broader impacts include graduate student training and research opportunities for Native Alaskan high-school students participating in a six-week summer college preparatory program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The large moment of the Denali earthquake, the precise pre-earthquake deformation field, and the immediate field response make this the most promising target to address postseismic deformation problems since modern space-geodetic methods became available.<br/>Our observational strategy consists of continuous GPS (CGPS) measurements at 16 sites located at a wide range of distances from the rupture, including some at > 150 km, in order to distinguish processes in the deep fault zone, the lower crust and upper mantle. Eleven of these sites were installed within two weeks after the event and have since been operating continuously. A fundamental objective of the proposed research is to precisely determine the time-dependence of the postseismic deformation signal. CGPS measurements will be complemented by two GPS campaigns per year, using existing benchmarks, in order to spatially densify the postseismic displacement field. We will also test the ability of InSAR to measure the coseismic and early postseismic deformation.<br/>The observational efforts will be complemented by comprehensive modeling efforts to evaluate candidate deformation mechanisms such as velocity-strengthening afterslip, poroelastic rebound, and viscous flow in the lower crust and upper mantle. Characterization of the relative importance of each of these mechanisms is a major goal of this research project. We will fully explore the ability of the different model types (e.g., time-dependent afterslip on and below the rupture vs. powerlaw flow in the lower crust and upper mantle) to fit the data while being consistent with complementary geological and geophysical constraints. <br/><br/>PIs: J.

They will study the foraging strategy of muskoxen                                                               o                         in Peary Land, North Greenland.  The study area, at 83 N contains the           muskoxen, which are the northernmost population of ungulates in the             world.  At this latitude the muskoxen must compensate for limitations           in available forage  by optimizing their intake of high quality forage          in the summer and by slowing their activity in the winter.  During the          summer the muskoxens' movements and the plant species grazed upon will          be directly observed by the researchers.  The movement patterns of the          animals in the winter will be measured through the use of                       activity-monitoring collars transmitting data via satellite.

The project will investigate on-shelf transport of slope water, which supplies nutrients that sustain new primary production in summer, a season when the availability of new production on the shelf is limited by stratification. A second hypothesis is that this new production will be dominated by diatoms rather than by flagellates, and a diatom-based food web will result in meso-zooplankton with a greater energy content than meso-zooplankton in a flagellate-based food web. These energy-rich zooplankton are expected to be of greater value to juvenile fish and planktivorous seabirds than those that have fed upon less lipid-rich phytoplankton. The project will also test these hypotheses during July/August cruises in 2004 to 2007. During these cruises, the PIs will compare production and its fate in an area on the middle shelf where summer-time cross-shelf advection is weak (Mooring 2), on the middle shelf in an area of episodic advection but little vertical mixing (Mooring 4) and at the Pribilof Islands where there is both on-shelf transport and tidal mixing of nutrients into the upper mixed layer. The project will measure along- and across-shelf flows (Stabeno, PMEL), nutrient concentrations (Mordy, UW/PMEL), standing stocks of phytoplankton (Zeeman, U. New England), new, regenerated and total production (Zeeman, Sambrotto, Lamont-Doherty), the grazing rates of micro-zooplankton in relation to phytoplankton standing stocks and production (Strom, Western Washington University), zooplankton biomass and composition (Coyle, U. Alaska, Fairbanks), lipid content, fatty-acid composition, and stable isotope signatures of zooplankton, juvenile fish and seabirds (Napp, NMFS), and the foraging distributions and food habits of marine birds (Hunt, U. California, Irvine). In addition, the project will use satellite-tracked drifters and moorings to measure currents. This proposal is the first in the Bering Sea to address the effect of on-shelf fluxes of nutrient-rich slope water on post-spring-bloom new production, and in turn, how this new production affects the abundance and quality of prey for juvenile fish (i.e., age-0 walleye pollock) and planktivorous seabirds. Post-bloom new production may be particularly important for providing high quality prey at a time when juvenile fish are developing the reserves to carry them through the winter and seabirds are feeding growing young. The work focuses on a region of great economic and societal importance, and examines the ecological processes that affect the productivity of Pribilof Islands' waters and their ability to support juvenile fish, and the seabirds and marine mammals that depend on them. The most abundant fish in the area are juvenile walleye pollock, the target of the world's largest single-species fishery. The information generated by the proposed research will be of value in assessing the mechanisms whereby global climate change can affect the amount of post- spring bloom new production and the nutritional quality of prey available to upper trophic levels. The project will include undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students in the field and in the laboratory for the analysis and workup of the data and will strive to develop outreach programs with the school systems on St Paul and St. George Islands. The work will be disseminated in the refereed literature and through web sites.<br/>"

The project pairs new distance learning software, Self-Induced Learning Infrastructure (SELIN), with materials designed to generate enthusiasm among college students for science research.  Several programs in Alaska are currently using community based traditional knowledge as a launching point for science education.  A good example is an existing lesson that uses dog sleds to teach physics to students from rural Alaskan communities.   The Alaska based SELIN project team will add to these efforts by investigating a new area of social science research on human-animal interactions by investigating the relationships between dog mushers and their dogs.  This relationship will be documented and the data used to create a course that teaches social science concepts and research methods to college students. <br/><br/>SELIN, the new e-learning platform developed at the University of Neuchâtel, Switzerland, lends itself to a variety of observational sciences including biology, veterinary medicine, sociology, linguistics, and child development.  The availability of SELIN distance courses in English will make the platform accessible to a wider audience.  The findings and data that come from this research (which will be made available, unedited, to other researchers) about the cultural and economic factors that drive dog mushing will be beneficial to veterinarians and those involved in resource management in the Arctic.  The fact that the course is asynchronous means it can deliver science to communities where there is limited access to scientists and science education, among them rural and Indigenous Arctic communities for whom the subject matter is of particular interest.  The findings from the research used to develop the course on human and animal communication offer insights for those involved in practical applications such as training and coordinating activities with animal species for search and rescue, law enforcement, and potentially service animals who assist the disabled."

Specifically, an integrated study that combines lidar, radar, and satellite measurements will be conducted to characterize turbulence in the presence of persistent mesospheric inversion layers. The study will draw on established instruments at Chatanika, Alaska (65°N, 147°W); namely an established Rayleigh lidar and the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar. The lidar will yield high-resolution temperature and density measurements that allow characterization of the mesospheric inversion layers and wave activity in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT). The radar will provide spectral measurements of turbulence. These observations will provide a framework for characterizing turbulence in the presence of persistent instabilities in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere. The wintertime Arctic middle atmosphere provides a unique natural laboratory for observing large-scale wave breaking and persistent instabilities in the middle atmosphere. In the winter planetary waves, generated in the troposphere, routinely break in the stratosphere and mesosphere and disrupt the circulation. Studies to date indicate that the western Arctic may be a center of action for planetary wave breaking and formation of persistent mesospheric inversion layers due to the presence of the Aleutian anticyclone and the interactions between the anticyclone and the Arctic vortex during periods of enhanced planetary wave activity. The study's focus is on observations of waves and turbulence at the lower border of the Space Atmosphere Interaction Region (SAIR). This SAIR-based study addresses the coupling that is critical to a systems-based understanding of the atmosphere, represents a transition in geospace, and determines the current structure and composition of geospace and how it evolves. The research will fuse knowledge from remote sensing and geophysical fluid analysis, and directly support understanding in natural sciences.  It will support education and training of students in science and engineering, employ and extend research infrastructure in the Arctic, enhance international collaborations, and promote collaboration amongst universities and laboratories in the US and Japan. The research results will be integrated into the University of Alaska programs and disseminated through a variety of professional, educational, and outreach programs."

The study is an international collaboration between investigators at six institutions in Canada, Germany, Japan and the United States. The satellite observations yield global synoptic-scale temperature measurements of the mesosphere and upper stratosphere while the meteorological soundings and analyses provide global synoptic-scale measurements of the troposphere and lower stratosphere. An international network of four Rayleigh lidars located in observatories at Andoya, Norway (69N, 16E), Chatanika, Alaska (65N, 147W), Eureka, Nunavut (80N, 86W), and Kangarlussuaq, Greenland (67N, 51W), will provide a chain of high-resolution temperature measurements from the eastern Arctic to the western Arctic. The lidars will yield high-resolution measurements of the structure and circulation of the Arctic stratospheric vortex, the Aleutian anticyclone, the stratospheric surf-zone, planetary waves, tides, and gravity waves that are corroborated by the synoptic-scale satellite and meteorological observations. The proposed activity will provide a comprehensive analysis of the circulation of the Arctic atmosphere that will directly address the following specific studies; the structure, evolution, and variability of polar vortices and anticyclones, coupling and feedbacks between waves and large-scale circulation, links between the middle and lower atmosphere, atmospheric teleconnections, and modes of variability. This study will provide data and analyses in support of studies of ozone depletion, stratospheric climate, climate oscillations in the Arctic, and long-range horizontal and vertical transport in the Arctic.  The proposed activity will support education and training of students in science and engineering.

While the strategy of integrating art and science to promote interest, identity, and other STEM-related learning has grown in recent years, this domain is still nascent with respect to a guiding set of best practices.  Through prior work, the team has developed and implemented a set of design principles that incorporate effective practices for broadening participation of girls in science via science-art integration on the topic of the biology, chemistry and optics of ""Colors in Nature."" The continued initiative would impact the ISL field by providing a mechanism for ISL educators in museums, libraries and after-school programs to adopt and implement these STEAM design principles into their work. The team will lead long-term (12-18 months) professional development activities for ISL educators, including: 1) in-person workshops that leverage their four previously developed kits; 2) online, asynchronous learning activities featuring interactive instructional videos around their STEAM design principles; 3) synchronous sessions to debrief content and foster communities of practice; and 4) guided design work around the development or redesign of STEAM activities.  In the first four years of the project, the team will work with four core institutional partners (Sitka Sound Science Center, Sno-Isle Libraries, the Fairbanks North Star Borough School District after-school program, and the Pima County Public Library system) across three states (Alaska, Washington, and Arizona). In the project's later stages, they will disseminate their learning tools to a broad, national audience.  This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.<br/><br/>The project has three main goals: (1) To support ISL educators in offering meaningful STEAM activities, (2) To create institutional change among the partner organizations, and (3) To advance the ISL field with respect to professional development and designing for STEAM Programming.  The research questions associated with the professional development activities address the ways in which change occurs and focus on all three levels: individual, institutional, and the ISL field.  The methods are qualitative and quantitative, including videotaped observations, pre and post interviews, surveys and analysis of online and offline artifacts.  In addition, the project evaluation will assess the implementation of the project's professional development model for effectiveness.  Methods will include observations, interviews, surveys and Website analytics and program data."

These winds have speeds in excess of 15 meters per second and appear continuously upward over several hours. They are generally preceded by a period of downward winds with speeds of 20 to 30 m/s. Far from being an intriguing curiosity, vertical winds are important to understanding the complex dynamic behavior of the upper atmosphere. Vertical winds in the thermosphere are responsible for vertical mass transport, disrupting stratification and changing the local composition, which can lead to changes in the overall thermal budget. Understanding the underlying source of these sustained vertical upward winds will enable a prediction of the global distribution of their occurrence and their impact on thermospheric dynamics. The study will take advantage of a critical mass of key instruments in the auroral zone in central Alaska that will produce comprehensive data sets to characterize the auroral input and large scale thermospheric conditions leading to the sustained upward vertical wind events. The primary instruments for observing vertical winds will be a set of three imaging Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPI), located at Poker Flat, Fort Yukon and Eagle, AK and dedicated to high-cadence zenith measurements. The contextual instruments include the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR), a set of four scanning Doppler imagers (SDI) at Poker Flat, Gakona, Toolik Field Station, and Kaktovik, AK, all-sky cameras and meridian spectrographs at Poker Flat and remote observing sites. The broader impacts of this work will be the training and educational opportunities for undergraduates in technical research by participating in the analysis of the data obtained by the zenith FPI instruments."

This permafrost subsystem regulates the local exchange of energy, water, and materials (including carbon and nitrogen), and its influence extends beyond the arctic land to the hydrosphere and the extra-tropical climate. Furthermore, the long timescale of permafrost dynamics requires evaluation of the evolution and impacts of the subsystem on the glacial-interglacial time frame. While some recent numerical projections show rapid and widespread degradation of permafrost in response to climate change during this century, global climate system models with physically based snow and permafrost dynamics have not been fully tested, using new observationally-based evidence, for spatial and temporal variability of the subsystem under different climate conditions such as the Holocene optimum or the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Evaluation of the climate sensitivity to the permafrost will provide vital insight to future scenarios, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. The focus will be on three late Quaternary eras for which numerical simulations are widely performed by the collaborative efforts of the Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project (PMIP: i.e., the preindustrial present (0 ka, where ka = thousand years before present), mid-Holocene (6 ka), and the LGM (21ka). This project will focus on evaluating the structure and function of the permafrost subsystem under different climate conditions. <br/><br/>The primary questions to be addressed are:  <br/>1. How well do the permafrost distributions simulated by global climate models agree with reconstructions from the proxy data? <br/>2. How widely did the permafrost distribution change under different climate conditions? Will permafrost change have serious consequences in nature, life, and societies in the Arctic? Correspondingly, by which processes and interactions does the permafrost subsystem impact the climate of the past and present? How important are the vegetation and soil types? <br/>3. What can we learn from the permafrost subsystem simulations under different climatic conditions to mitigate or adapt to future changes?  <br/><br/>Intellectual merits: The reconstructed vegetation map currently available for the climate model inputs will be updated by combining recent results from paleobotanic research, providing a basis for our surface boundary conditions. The simulated results (permafrost distribution) from multiple models as well as the forcing data from the PMIP2 outputs (surface temperature, precipitation [or wetness], and surface wind) will be compared and evaluated with other updated proxy-derived maps. A series of organized numerical sensitivity experiments with different levels of complexity in snow-permafrost dynamics will delineate the essential processes within the permafrost subsystem. Hierarchical experiments of coupled and uncoupled simulations with the atmosphere will quantify the interactions between the atmosphere and the subsurface, and the function of the subsystem as a whole in arctic and global climate.  <br/><br/>Broader impacts: broader impact activities will focus on delivering information about direct implications for future climate change projection, and for adaptation planning. Improved scientific understanding of the permafrost subsystem will enhance assessments of the risks of climate change to infrastructure and society, especially on life and culture in the Arctic. This project will also contribute to emerging efforts in earth system modeling, which requires realistic subsurface simulations in order to study the biogeochemical processes that are important for surface exchanges of water vapor and other radiatively active gases. Maps of past permafrost distribution, vegetation and other simulated results in Beringia provide materials to the social and anthropogenic sciences, particularly in such topics as the history of human migration into North America, and the early history of Alaska Natives. It will also facilitate outreach to secondary schools, universities, museums and the general public. Underrepresented student populations such as Alaska Natives, those geographically isolated and economically disadvantaged are among the target audiences."

In line with three of the International Polar Year (IPY) priority areas, this project intends to (1) increase international collaboration between circumpolar institutions, (2) leave a legacy of infrastructure and data, and (3) increase Indigenous capacity for research and action. The Pathways study is a comparative, collaborative, and participatory circumpolar research project. Its aims are to explore responses to rapid social transition through the life experiences of circumpolar youth. The proposed study will examine 80 youth life history narratives. These narratives will come from an Alaska Inupiat, Alaska Yupik, Canadian Inuit, and Siberian Eveny community. In addition, the research team is developing collaborations using additional funding sources to examine the narratives of an additional 40 youth from a Norwegian Samì and Greenlandic community. In this study, the team intends to identify shared and divergent stressors and patterns of resilience in the transition to adulthood across these different circumpolar settings. Youth resilience is defined as the ability to overcome acute and on-going difficulties in the pathway to adulthood. The investigators seek to identify cultural strategies and resources that characterize resiliency across two age groups, ages 11-14 and 15-18, and across gender.<br/><br/>The impact of a shared colonial history and contemporary social suffering among indigenous communities in the Arctic has been extensively documented through decades of Arctic social science research. The issue of healthy adaptation and resilience among Indigenous youth has not been adequately considered, leaving developmental trajectories of healthy adaptation and resilience relatively unexplored. This research aims to build on Indigenous categories to describe the social experiences and resources shaping culturally patterned resilience strategies of young people responding to challenges distinct from those of their parents and grandparents. This will provide insights into the family, community, and cultural contexts that support healthy youth development, and identify key ingredients to successful prevention and intervention health strategies for Indigenous young people. Study across six circumpolar communities will also provide unprecedented insights into the effect of diverse social, political, cultural, and economic systems on youth development, and inform effective social policy for circumpolar youth.<br/><br/>This project builds on and sustains long-term participatory research relationships between local community institutions, community co-researchers, and a multidisciplinary team of international university researchers. Indigenous community co-researcher involvement and direction is emphasized throughout all phases of this project, whose aims respond to strong local interest in youth resilience and wellbeing. Development of interview schedules, data collection procedures, and the analysis will be in collaboration with Local Steering Committees (LSC) to ensure their cultural grounding. A representative from each LSC will be actively involved in the cross-site work through membership in an international Circumpolar Steering Committee. Dissemination with communities and regional Indigenous organizations will contribute to a developing network of circumpolar communities engaged in suicide prevention, promotion of collective wellbeing, and development of a circumpolar Indigenous identity. The study will also establish tracking procedures, participatory research infrastructure, and international circumpolar collaboration for future longitudinal, prospective study of safe passage into adulthood."

Understanding their source mechanisms could advance knowledge of the dynamic mass balance of Earth?s cryosphere, as well as improve models and understanding of glacier erosion and landscape evolution. Preliminary results from a 1-year pilot study highlight the tidewater glaciers<br/>of Icy Bay, Alaska as the regionally dominant source of glacier-generated seismic energy. Icy Bay is the optimal study site because of its highly dynamic glaciers, logistical simplicity and similarities with disintegrating outlet glaciers in Greenland.

Internationally, reported or unpublished temperature measurements have been obtained at various depths and periods over the past five or more decades, and it is known that these temperatures have changed at different rates in different regions. Analysis of temperature measurements obtained in these boreholes provides historical records of secular surface climate changes (deep holes) and interannual to decadal changes in surface boundary layer (intermediate depths). The Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost (GTN-P) is a metadata based system established in the late 1990s under the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) which currently contains access to more than 425 documented borehole and 165 active layer sites across both polar regions. In Alaska, two major series of boreholes exist within the GTN-P with observations dating back to the 1970s; the US Geological Survey deep boreholes (>125 m) and the University of Alaska?s intermediate boreholes (<100m). This effort will link approximately 80 Alaskan boreholes with sites of observations in other countries in Northern Eurasia, and in so doing will initiate the International Network of Permafrost Observatories (INPO). This work will coordinate data collection using standard equipment and protocols at the Alaskan borehole sites and at a selected number of sites in Russia. The Alaskan and Eurasian borehole temperature data sets will provide the baseline to reconstruct past surface temperatures, to assess the future rates of change in near-surface permafrost temperatures and permafrost boundaries, and to provide spatial data for validation of climate scenario models and temperature reanalysis approaches.<br/><br/>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br/>"

Depending on location, terminal Pleistocene extinctions were caused by some combination of rapid climatic change and over-hunting by humans. In the Arctic, where few humans lived 10,000 years ago, climatic change was probably the major culprit. Understanding phylogeographic patterns and aspects of population dynamics of species during this time of change can lead to insights of responses of species to climate change. Analysis of DNA from long-dead animals can be used to answer questions about changes in genetic patterns in relation to climate change during the late Pleistocene. These questions, unapproachable only a decade ago, now can be addressed using new techniques of DNA analysis applied to ancient bones preserved in permafrost. Recent studies of ancient DNA from late Pleistocene brown bears (Ursus arctos) suggest their genetic history is more complicated than that implied by the fossil record. This project is a pilot study to investigate patterns of genetic change in an herbivore that survived the terminal Pleistocene extinctions in northern North America and continues to inhabit the Arctic. <br/><br/>The study species is the muskox (Ovibos moschatus), for which there is an extensive collection of carbon-14 dated bones recently collected from permafrost in northern Alaska. Modern muskoxen have extremely low levels of genetic variability, and this pilot project will investigate whether there is sufficient variability in the ancient muskox bones to provide information on phylogeographic patterns and population genetics during the late Pleistocene and how any genetic changes might relate to climate change. Fragments of mitochondrial DNA from bones of ages spanning 5,000 to 40,000 years will be amplified and sequenced using accepted ancient DNA techniques. Replications of all stages of analysis of some bones will be performed at the University of California Los Angeles. The DNA sequences will be analyzed to determine if they can be used to infer population level parameters of genetics. Changes in genetic patterns will be compared to the paleoclimate record based on Greenland ice core records and other, more local paleo-environmental data from the North Slope of Alaska. <br/><br/>Though this project is exploratory, and risky, if the field and laboratory methodologies are successful, this eork should lead to valuable advances in understanding paleo- population genetics and the influence of climate change on genetic changes. This understanding could benefit the field of conservation genetics and management of endangered species. <br/>"

The research will be conducted at Glacier                 Bay, ""the"" classical example of facilitation.  Although most                    experimental work has shown facilitation to be unimportant in                   terrestrial ecosystems, this work has been largely restricted to                secondary succession where soils are well developed, whereas the                concept of facilitation originated mainly from observations in                  primary succession, where plants confront a more severe                         environment.  The central hypothesis to be tested is that life                  history traits explain the basic pattern of succession, but that                the rate of succession is influenced by both facilitative and                   competitive interactions among species.  Life history traits to                 be measured in the field are seed rain, growth rate, age of first               reproduction, and longevity.  Possible inhibitory effects of                    established vegetation upon seed germination and initial                        establishment will be tested by sowing spruce and alder seeds                   into each of four successional stages (uncolonized, Dryas, alder,               and spruce) in presence and absence of forest floor.

Changes in the wetness of Arctic land surfaces can have consequences for vegetative stress, susceptibility to wildfires, and terrestrial release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. Land surface wetness may also affect wildlife, as well as human activities such as subsistence hunting and fishing, overland travel, access to resources, and water availability. Global climate models are unanimous in projecting increases in Arctic precipitation and nearly so in projecting increases of runoff. Projections of net moisture flux, or the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration, vary widely among models, especially during the warm season. Observational data point to recent decreases in soil moisture for at least some parts of the Arctic, consistent with increasing evapotranspiration in a warming climate, but increases in surface water in other areas. This study will synthesize different types of existing data to optimize model projections of anticipated changes to Arctic surface wetness. In addition to improved understanding of how a key Arctic process is represented in global models, the broader impacts of this project include training for a graduate student and dissemination of results to policy and stakeholder communities through the Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic Planning and Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy programs. <br/>  <br/>The investigators will synthesize three types of existing data on Arctic evapotranspiration (ET): in situ measurements from observing sites, remote-sensing-derived estimates of ET, and global climate model output. They will use these diverse data sources to: 1) clarify the drivers of ET variations over time in different vegetative types and 2) evaluate climate model simulations of terrestrial ET and its variability in the Arctic. The field sites will include various tundra and boreal vegetation types, both with and without permafrost, and observations will include incident radiation, humidity, and wind speed to assess the drivers of ET in the data and in climate models. Global climate model output will come primarily from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Satellite remote-sensing-derived estimates will come from MODIS archives and will bridge the scale discrepancy between models and in situ measurements. Validation of model output against in situ and remote-sensing derived estimates will focus on variation in ET over timescales of days to years. Synthesis of the three types of information will assess key processes that climate models must capture to produce credible projections of Arctic terrestrial hydrology.  Based on their ability to capture seasonal cycles and ET over various vegetation types, the investigators will identify the most realistic global models, along with their formulational and structural characteristics. Results will help set priorities for model improvement and model selection to enable more robust conclusions about the trajectory of Arctic terrestrial surface wetness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will examine these questions through new Arctic specimen collections and identifications, temperature determinations and growth studies, and comparison to findings with animals living at warmer lower latitudes. This project will bring together a diverse team of scientists who will share new ideas and methodologies and contribute to the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students. Results will be disseminated in scientific venues and presented publicly through museum exhibitions and K-12 presentations. The latter will include visits to rural, northern Alaskan schools to provide underserved Alaska Native students and teachers with an opportunity to learn about the fossils in their area and interact with NSF-sponsored researchers. <br/><br/>Using macro- and microfossil remains, this study will establish a comprehensive dataset on the faunal composition of a Mesozoic polar assemblage, including descriptions of probable new species unique to the Arctic. Statistical techniques will be used to compare the faunal compositions between mid- and high latitudes to understand North American distribution patterns. Histological analyses of bones and teeth will provide the first rigorous testing of the affects of polar environments on the growth and physiology of dinosaurs and mammals. Lastly, a novel technique using biomarkers will be used to provide more precise paleotemperature estimates to understand the temperature regime experienced by the polar fauna."

Public Participation in Scientific Research (PPSR) presents a possible method to increase flow of scientific and local knowledge, enhance STEM-based problem solving skills, and co-create new knowledge about phenology at local and regional or larger scales. However, there remain some key challenges that the field of PPSR research must address to achieve this goal. The proposed research will make substantial contributions to two of these issues by: 1) advancing theory on the interactions between PPSR and resilience in social-ecological systems, and 2) advancing our understanding of strategies to increase the engagement of youth and adults historically underrepresented in STEM, including Alaska Native and indigenous youth and their families who play an essential role in the sustainability of environmental monitoring in the high latitudes and rural locations throughout the globe. In particular, our project results will assist practitioners in choosing and investing in design elements of  PPSR projects to better navigate the trade-offs between large-scale scientific outcomes and local cultural relevance. The data collected across the citizen science network will also advance scientific knowledge on the effects of phenological changes on berry availability to people and other animals. <br/><br/>The Arctic Harvest research goals are to 1) critically examine the relationship between PPSR learning outcomes in informal science environments and attributes of social-ecological resilience and 2) assess the impact of two program design elements (level of support and interaction with mentors and scientists, and an innovative story-based delivery method) on the engagement of underserved audiences. In partnership with afterschool clubs in urban and rural Alaska, we will assess the impact of participation in Winterberry, a new PPSR project that investigates the effect of changes in the timing of the seasons on subsistence berry resources. We propose to investigate individual and community-level learning outcomes expected to influence the ability for communities to adapt to climate change impacts, including attributes of engagement, higher-order thinking skills, and their influence on the level of civic action and interest in berry resource stewardship by the youth groups. Using both quantitative and qualitative approaches, we compare these outcomes with the same citizen science program delivered through two alternate methods: 1) a highly supported delivery method with increased in-person interaction with program mentors and scientists, and 2) an innovative method that weaves in storytelling based on elder experiences, youth observations, and citizen science data at all stages of the program learning cycle.  This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.

SuperDARN is a network of (high frequency) HF Doppler radar located in the high latitude regions of the Northern and Southern hemispheres.  The radar is sensitive to backscatter from ionspheric electric fields that produce this drift.  SuperDARN is the only currently available experimental technique capable of providing continuous, large scale, direct observations of the high-latitude electric field.  This field is of interest because of its role in the transfer of energy and momentum from the Earth's magnetosphere to the upper atmosphere.  The electric field is a consequence of the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere and many plasma processes occurring within the magnetosphere.  Knowledge of its global structure and dynamics are fundamental to understanding large-scale plasma processes in the near Earth space environment, and in deter mining the importance of electrodynamics energy input to the high-latitude regions of the Earth's upper atmosphere.<br/><br/>The Kodiak SuperDARN radar is a new facility that was constructed under a grant from the National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs.  It will act as an integral part of the SuperDARN radar network and will address the goals of U.S. Arctic research in the high-latitude upper atmosphere and near-Earth space.<br/><br/>A construction of the Kodiak SuperDARN radar nears completion, it is important that a base of support be established for its operation.  This project demonstrates the importance of the measurements that this new facility will provide and the vitality of the research community that has been built up around the SuperDARN network.  Operations of the Kodiak radar will enhance the already significant contributions of SuperDARN to arctic research.<br/>"

Previous research has identified indigenous groups and women as some of the most vulnerable populations affected by pronounced political, economic, and environmental shifts. In this study the researchs seek to examine gendered responses to the processes of globalization and significant social-environmental change and the shifting roles of women in the midst of such changes. This research will provide an in-depth study of the gendered, multigenerational responses to specific contemporary changes in Barrow, Alaska, an Iñupiat subsistence-based community and economic and administrative hub of Arctic Slope region. While it is widely recognized that women play important roles as providers in this region, more research is needed on the evolving nature of women?s ?work? given new vocational and educational opportunities in the context of shifting mixed economies, increasing regulation of the environment, cumulative oil and gas exploration and extraction, and pronounced environmental change. <br/><br/>Drawing on the theoretical frameworks of traditional ecological knowledge and political ecology, the PIs ask several primary research questions: 1) How do recent shifts in local livelihoods reshape discourses and practices on what it means to be a female provider in Barrow in changing times? 2) What are the linkages between women?s work and community well-being? 3) To what extent have recent shifts in local livelihoods impacted the ability of women to nurture diversity and create opportunities for self-organization and self-determination? and 4) How are women participating in, and providing leadership to, local and regional political networks? The research design is guided by feminist and participatory research approaches; the researchers have built methodological flexibility into their research design to enable the local research team and advisors to help shape the direction of the project. The project uses mixed methods, combining participant observation, semi-structured interviews, critical case studies, and social network analysis. <br/><br/>Women?s roles have been an underrepresented aspect of indigenous management strategies worldwide and this project recognizes women as empowered individuals who often foster the well-being of their communities. Thus, this research provides an important opportunity to explore applied concerns in anthropology and resource management by valuing women?s traditional ecological knowledge and provisional roles during a time of intense shifts. The investigators also anticipate that this research will be useful and meaningful for the community of Barrow and will have broader applications to other indigenous groups facing similar challenges. They hope the collaborative and participatory nature of their research, including local people in the research process and providing additional opportunities to provide trainings and foster dialogue about research and ethics, will make a significant contribution to both the research and educational activities in Barrow and international discussions about the appropriate relationships between researchers, research programs, and local communities."

Nitrous oxide is produced and released to the atmosphere by microbes that cycle nitrogen in soils and sediment, often in response to excess nitrogen. High-latitude ecosystems typically contribute little nitrous oxide to the atmosphere because of limited availability of the forms of nitrogen conducive to nitrous oxide production. However, exceptionally large fluxes of nitrous oxide are increasingly documented from arctic and sub-arctic soils that are subject to cryoturbation or thawing permafrost. It remains unclear how this nitrous oxide is produced and how long disturbed soils might generate emissions. This project will support training in several analytical approaches for determining the quantity and pathways of nitrous oxide production in soils. Research will focus on Alaskan ecosystems that are subject to wildfire and permafrost thaw. Researchers will also adapt and apply novel methods with stable isotopes to determine the microbial pathways producing nitrous oxide. Determining how nitrous oxide is produced will decrease uncertainty in predicting how ecosystems respond to changing regimes of fire and permafrost and clarify how ecosystems might in turn influence the climate system.  <br/>  <br/>Several studies over the past decade have documented significant emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) from arctic soils where permafrost is thawing. However, these studies have not revealed the biological processes generating N2O, which might include denitrification, nitrification, and nitrifier-denitrification. Because the pathways of N2O production in high-latitude soils remain unknown, it is presently difficult to forecast potential emissions under warmer, more nutrient-rich, and fire-prone conditions predicted for high-latitude ecosystems. An Alaska-based research team will work with the nitrogen analytical facility at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies to apply and optimize novel analytical approaches. These studies will include real-time production of N2O in response to manipulated soil conditions, and analysis of isotopomers (describing site preference of 15N), which can identify the microbial pathway producing N2O. These approaches will be applied across precipitation events, seasonal, and successional time scales and spatial gradients encompassing variation in nitrogen inputs, permafrost, and burn history within the region of spatially discontinuous permafrost in Interior Alaska. Goals of the research include identifying the microbial pathways that produce N2O in high-latitude soils and testing hypothesized relationships between nitrogen cycling and the fire, permafrost, and moisture regimes of the boreal forest. Establishing these relationships is an essential step toward identifying potential positive feedback loops between nitrogen cycling and climate warming in high-latitude ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The role of this ice age refugium, referred to as Beringia, for boreal trees and shrubs is largely unknown.  The prevailing hypothesis for boreal woody plant taxa favors extinction in the far north, with subsequent recolonization from a refugium south of continental ice sheets.  This long-standing view was challenged recently by discovery of fossil tree pollen from Alaska dating to the late-Quaternary which indicated balsam poplar, or Populus balsamifera, is a candidate for survival of glaciation events within Beringia.  This research aims to assess this alternative hypothesis by drawing upon evidence from the complementary fields of molecular phylogeography and floristic plant geography.<br/><br/>The implications of this research extend to understanding Beringian archeology, the impact of Beringia on species and population diversity of arctic and boreal plants, and the influences of past climate change.  Moreover, this study will document the geographic distribution of genetic diversity within balsam poplar providing a key resource knowledge-base for future development of economically important poplar hybrids.  Poplar is predicted to play a key role in agroforesty, CO2 biosequestration programs and biofuel and biodiesel production.  Ultimately, this research will aid in development of baseline hypotheses for understanding the influences of past demographic events on genomic variation in poplar. <br/>"

Large earthquakes substantially change forces (stresses) within the Earth, and by measuring and modeling the response to these changes, we can learn about the mechanical properties of deep fault zones and the material that surrounds them. This time-dependent and transient response of the Earth produces postseismic deformation, which we will measure using high-precision GPS. A key challenge of postseismic deformation studies is to separate the effects of the two main mechanisms, afterslip or continued slip on the deep fault plane, and viscoelastic relaxation within the mantle and/or lower crust. In the first few years after the earthquake, these two mechanisms can produce similar deformation at the surface of the Earth, but they decay with time at different rates. In this project, we will use a long record of data (up to 15 years) following the 2002 Denali fault earthquake to develop a complete model for the postseismic deformation following this earthquake. This improved mechanical model will allow us to better understand the forces that drive tectonic deformation in Alaska, and the interaction between earthquakes.<br/><br/>We will carry out GPS surveys of a dense network of sites surrounding the 2002 fault rupture. These data will provide important spatial resolution to complement the sparse continuous GPS network from the Plate Boundary Observatory, which provides critical information about the time evolution of the postseismic deformation. We will carefully examine the observed deformation to identify observations that can be explained entirely or mostly by a single postseismic mechanism, if possible, which makes it easier to constrain model parameters. We will recalculate a new coseismic slip distribution using a finite element code that can utilize the full 3-D inferred elastic Earth structure, including the subducting slab, so that we can most accurately compute the postseismic response to the slip. We will develop 3D finite element models and other models to explain the observed deformation, and evaluate how these models would respond to other stress changes like the 1964 earthquake, or glacial unloading. We will share information about the Denali fault, earthquakes in Alaska, and the results of this project with the public through interaction with Denali National Park. The Park hosts about 400,000 visitors each year and coordinated outreach efforts with the Park offer a chance to reach a broad audience."

The occurrence of the Mw 7.9 November 3, 2002 Denali Alaska earthquake has created the opportunity to collect the surface deformation measurements needed to make significant improvements in our knowledge of the dominant deformation mechanisms in the Earth's lithosphere and the rheological parameters of the fault zone and surrounding crust and upper mantle. The large moment of the Denali earthquake, the precise pre-earthquake deformation field, and the immediate field response make this the most promising target to address post-seismic deformation problems since modern space-geodetic methods became available. <br/><br/>This grant supports the upgrade, expansion, and continued operation and maintenance of an existing post-seismic GPS network proximal to the epicenter of the Mw 7.9 November 3, 2002 Denali Alaska Earthquake over a three-year period.  Within two weeks of the mainshock, UNAVCO engineers, with NSF support, installed 10 continuous GPS (CGPS) sites near the fault.  These sites form the core of a planned 16-station network. The first 10 sites were installed quickly and without power generation or telemetry, in order to get the sites in before extreme winter conditions made work impossible. This funding will allow for upgrade of these existing sites with robust enclosures and solar plus wind power.  An additional 6 new CGPS sites will also be established as part of the post-seismic GPS response network.  A related Geophysics grant will support geodynamic modeling of the data (EAR-0310410) and all GPS data will be available to the broader scientific community through the UNAVCO GPS data archive.<br/>***<br/><br/>"

The research component will gather data and information that will advance the understanding of a framework for broadening indigenous participation in STEM study and careers. The activity targets middle school students because research indicates that middle school is a time when engagement in STEM studies begins to decline.  Encouraging indigenous students to view completing high school as a step toward STEM careers is important because Native students compose a high percentage of the dropout population in Alaska and Hawaii.

One is a newly discovered continuous radio frequency (RF) radiation at the crater mouth during the main eruption, and the other is large-scale lightning in the volcanic plume several minutes after the main eruption, with characteristics similar to lightning found in thunderstorms. These observations, made using Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) instrumentation developed at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, were the first detailed, high time resolution observations of such volcanic electrical activity. In this new research program volcano-produced electrical activity will be observed at two permanent sites in Alaska with an array of atmospheric electrical instrumentation including the LMA to make detailed three-dimensional images of the electrical activity; and electric field mills, fast antennas and slow antennas to characterize the polarity of the lightning activity. A low-power version of the LMA sensor will be developed, which will allow for long-term monitoring of volcanic electrical activity in remote locations, and for rapid deployment to sites with no grid power available. The research will involve both scientific studies of volcanic lightning and electrical activity, and continued development and advancement of the instrumentation for making such observations. The intellectual merit of the proposed research will derive from the scientific investigations. One major scientific goal is to use lightning mapping observations to ascertain the electrical structure of volcanic plume clouds. This will help lead to a better understanding of the charging mechanism in the plume. A second major goal is to better characterize the continuous RF activity during the explosive phase. A third major goal is to ascertain the usefulness of monitoring of electrical activity as an additional tool for the determination of the status of active volcanoes.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of the proposed activity will include further development of the lightning mapping technique as a useful technology to study and monitor volcanic eruptions. The system that will be developed could evolve into one that could be used to monitor a volcano and confirm eruptions, even when weather conditions preclude visual observations. It could be used as an additional tool to help volcanologists in their decision-making process for generating warnings to nearby populations, and to aircraft. Tracking of the in-plume lightning can give the direction that the ash cloud is moving. The system will give the volcanologists another tool to study the eruptions with high time resolution. The understanding of charging in the volcanic plume could lead to a better understanding of the charging in thunderstorms. A final aspect of the proposed research will be the development of a set of lightweight, solar-powered, battery-operated mapping stations that can be readily deployed for a variety of experiments and studies that are as yet not easily conducted. The involvement of graduate and undergraduate students both in the scientific and applied aspects of the research has broad implications for their education that can only come from working on real problems. This research will involve a collaboration between atmospheric and earth scientists in a cross-disciplinary environment. Inter-agency and international collaborations will be established as needed to work with groups in areas where it looks reasonable to deploy our instrumentation to study active volcanoes.

While the role of subglacial hydraulics during the surge has been well documented, the issue of surge initiation has remained unsolved. Also, the related question of why some glaciers surge and others do not remains open. This proposal will investigate whether the special geometry of many Alaska Range glaciers allows particularly large shear stresses to develop that eventually allow a surge to occur. The proposed work would focus on the Black Rapids Glacier on the Denali Fault in the eastern Alaska Range. The investigators contend that understanding glacier surges can also make a fundamental contribution to understanding of the basal boundary condition, which remains a major question in glaciology. As numerical models of ice flow are becoming more sophisticated, the issue of the basal boundary condition will have to be revisited and it is important to understand the strong non-linear aspects that lead to the switch from quiescence to surge. Lessons learned from surge initiation can also be applied to other situations where ice flows fast under high stress conditions, such as at fast outlet glaciers. The fieldwork would include radar to accurately map the base of the glacier, airborne lidar to generate a full digital elevation model of the surface of the glacier, GPS measurements of ice velocity, meteorological stations for climate data and ice ablation, and cameras to monitor the marginal lakes for drainage. These observations will be fully integrated with and complemented by a three-dimensional flow model of the glacier. The proposed work would form the core of a PhD thesis with training in field methods, data analysis, and numerical modeling. Scientific results will be presented at national and international meetings and in the peer-reviewed literature. Because glacier research tends to attract great interest among the general public, and Black Rapids is familiar to many Alaskans, this project is well-suited to public outreach. Outreach efforts will be coordinated through the institute's Information Office, which regularly schedules well-attended public talks and provides news columns about the institute's science activities."

This research will consist of a series of                      experiments to determine whether the formation of these patches                 is related to mycorrhizal colonization on recently deglaciated                  till.  Initial colonization by individual plants may be                         controlled by abiotic factors such as microsites for seed                       deposition and water catchment, while later patch formation may                 be regulated by both abiotic and biotic factors.  These biotic                  factors are the focus of this study.  The initial colonizing                    plant may act as a ""nurse "" plant both by ameliorating the                      microenvironment and by providing a source of mycorrhizal                       inoculum for later colonists.  The investigators hypothesize that               the initial colonizers in boreal Alaska are facultatively                       mycorrhizal, and that they can survive in glacial till without                  mycorrhizae until inoculum is naturally dispersed.  The next wave               of plant colonists may be facultatively or obligately                           mycorrhizal, and they may establish more rapidly if their seeds                 are deposited near a nurse plant.  Thus patch formation in the                  initial stages of glacial succession in Alaska may depend on                    mycorrhizal fungi.                                                                   Experiments will consist of planting both vesicular-                       arbuscular (VA) and ectomycorrhizal inoculated and uninoculated                 nurse plants on glacial till, planting uninoculated seedlings                   around the nurse plant, and observing natural plant and                         mycorrhizal colonization.  The effects of microenvironmental                    amelioration by the nurse plants versus mycorrhizal inoculation                 can be separated by comparing plant growth near and at a distance               from inoculated versus uninoculated nurse plants.  The                          physiological response of the individual plants to mycorrhizae                  will be measured under controlled conditions.  Many early to mid-               seral plants have been reported to be both VA and ectomycorrhizal               during succession on glacial till, and both types of fungi will                 be manipulated and observed."

They will excavate two sites located               on Unalaska Island in the Aleutian archipelago.  The older of the               two, the McLees Lake site, contains a number of individual                      household dwellings.  The more recent Reese Bay site preserves                  two multihousehold longhouses.

The goal of the research is to trace the development of social                  complexity among Aleut hunters and gatherers in the Aleutian                    Islands.  Both archaeological and ethnohistoric information                     suggest that in prehistoric times Aleut society changed from a                  relatively egalitarian form of organization to a more complex                   form characterized by a social and political hierarchy.  Dr.                    Aigner postulates that the McLees Lake and Reese Bay sites                      represent earlier and later phases of this process.  Through                    spatial analysis of house forms and burial and material remains,                one can determine the extent of hierarchical organization.                      Unequal distribution of living space and an association of high                 prestige items with specific burials or living areas indicate                   social inequality.                                                                                                                                              This research is important for several reasons.  Many                           anthropologists believe that growth of social complexity is a                   byproduct to the Neolithic revolution and that it was the                       domestication of plants and animals which began the process which               resulted societies as we know them today.  Others argue that                    complexity can develop in groups which subsist by hunting and                   gathering, and this research will directly address this issue.                  Secondly, in the passage of the Arctic Research Act, the U.S.                   Congress has recognized the importance of a broad program of                    Arctic research.  Dr. Aigner's project will help to further this                goal."

They are responsible for numerous volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, as the recent Anchorage earthquake. Important dynamical processes take place in between the two converging plates, such as the buoyant rising of molten mantle rock below volcanoes. Seismology offers a direct way to image the convective zones of subduction, which are between 30 km and 200 km deep. Seismometers installed in the field record seismic waves from earthquakes occurring in the down going plate and all over the world. By modeling the wave forms and timing, using techniques like those used in medical ultrasound imaging, images of the subduction zone can be obtained. Here, the project team will install more than 300 seismometers above the Alaska subduction zone. It will take advantage of the seismic waves produced by the ongoing aftershocks from the Anchorage earthquake to image at high resolution the subsurface structures. This project will also test the imaging capabilities of the timely deployment of dense networks of small seismometers, a new approach in seismology. It will provide critical constraints for models of subduction zone dynamics and associated hazards, as well as field experience to seven students in seismology. <br/><br/>This RAPID project will support the deployment of 306 seismometers (three-component nodal sensors) to image the Alaska subduction zone at an unprecedented resolution.  It will take advantage of the active local seismicity enhanced by the aftershocks of the 2018 magnitude-7 Anchorage earthquake. Recent results from Cascadia indicate that ambient noise and teleseism body waves can be used to image crustal structure. Here, local seismicity will be used to image the mantle wedge and crustal structure. Distant earthquakes will be used to image subsurface discontinuities, such as the crustal thickness and the subducting slab. Surface waves from ambient noise will be used to characterize the shallow crustal structure. This should allow resolving at km-scale the structural complexity within the mantle wedge between the subducting Pacific plate and the overlying North American crust. Furthermore, by leveraging an ongoing smaller-scale project focused on the Denali fault, this work will allow the simultaneous characterization of small-scale fault zone structures and broader crustal contrasts across the fault. Higher resolution images will provide important constraints for models seeking to understand the dynamics of subduction zones. The project is led by three early-career scientists and will involve seven students in seismology for the field deployment and recovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will allow researchers to track the evolution of sea ice profile properties and to fill a current gap in the real-time monitoring of local ice conditions needed to assess ice strength and trafficability. Experimental work involves cross-borehole tomography measurements not previously performed in sea ice, and applying a microstructurally-realistic improved analysis of Wenner array soundings. Both methods exploit the large resistivity contrast between saline brine and pure ice, which makes the bulk resistivity of sea ice very sensitive to the connectivity of the interior brine volume. The proposed site for this work is landfast first-year ice near Barrow, Alaska, offering the benefits of accessible and readily-monitored ice and proximity to logistics support. The measurements will be complemented by full ice characterization data collected at a nearby mass balance site installed by our group as part of the nascent Alaska Ocean Observing System. Through collaboration with a solid-earth geophysicist with expertise in geoelectric array measurements, substantial synergistic benefits will also be derived from this project. Resistivity measurements in low temperature winter ice and during spring warming are ideally suited to assess theoretical predictions of the appearance and evolution of a 'percolation threshold' in the brine volume connectivity, and other critical transitions in ice profile properties, such as substantial reductions in ice strength in the high-porosity (>10%) regime. The lack of appropriate field data (in particular time series) is significantly limiting progress in the research field, and this work aims to evaluate potential benefits that can be derived from novel geoelectric array measurements, owing to their high sensitivity, nondestructive nature and suitability for easy deployment in existing drifting sensor networks. This project will enhance research infrastructure by (1)  developing a method (and corresponding instrumentation) that helps close a significant gap in drifting sensor networks which do not provide information on the state of the ice cover and its transport properties; (2) providing for a means to test and refine the applicability of percolation theory to a number of important sea ice geophysical phenomena; (3) laying the foundation for routine in situ monitoring of the state of the ice cover as applicable for engineering and operational applications (such as those relying on sea ice as a stable platform for transport and logistics); and (4) enhancing collaboration and exchange between the solid-earth geophysics and sea-ice glaciology communities to address common problems of materials at high homologous temperatures. These aspects of the project will be introduced into education by involving graduate students in the research and integrating the collaboration into an interdisciplinary seminar series examining porous media from volcanological and glaciological perspectives."

Changes&#8232;in storm activity, and associated atmospheric feedbacks, have been linked to increased seasonality of the high north in the last decade, and with sea ice depletion during summer months. Cyclones are also likely to respond to changes in Arctic ice cover and ocean state indicating that&#8232;the atmosphere-ocean-ice system is tightly coupled through processes related to cyclones. Previous Arctic modeling studies typically used regional model simulations without full coupling&#8232;of the atmosphere-ocean-ice system, or fully coupled global climate models that do not permit year-on-year comparison with the observational record. This study will avoid such limitations by using&#8232;the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM), for which output corresponds directly with month-on-month observational records. This&#8232;will allow assessment of the ice-ocean-atmosphere coupling processes on multiple temporal&#8232;and spatial scales, and to relate them to limited Arctic Ocean measurements to build a more complete understanding of how increased cyclone activity may be helping to shift the surface climate of the Arctic to a new, warmer state with seasonal sea ice cover, and of how cyclones&#8232;will respond to this new Arctic Ocean state. <br/><br/>The impact of cyclones on Arctic stakeholder sectors in northern and western Alaska, including coastal communities and marine transport, will be assessed through a partnership with the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy and the project's inventory of Arctic cyclones and associated ocean and sea ice conditions will be archived at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Historical time series of annual and seasonal Arctic cyclone activity, maps of tracks and intensities of Arctic cyclones, and case studies of intense or impactful cyclones will be made available on a project web page. The project will engage graduate students and a post-doctoral fellow,&#8232;and results will be used in atmospheric and oceanic science undergraduate and graduate level courses at the project institutions. Outcomes from this work will be address priorities in the US National Strategy for the Arctic Region and will address key uncertainties in understanding extreme events and their role in the Arctic climate system. <br/><br/>The recent loss of Arctic sea ice has increased the potential for ocean-atmosphere coupling&#8232;in the Arctic, especially in areas of low ice concentration or where the ice edge has receded. An important aspect of increased ocean-atmosphere Arctic coupling is the&#8232; potential increase&#8232;of the ocean's response to storms. Where once mitigated by thick ice, wind-induced ice deformation and oceanic mixing are increasing as the ice pack thins. The decreasing Arctic ice cover and associated warming of the Arctic Ocean may also impact cyclone intensity and frequency. This grant will support investigation of changes in atmosphere-ice-ocean coupling in the presence of cyclones in the Arctic. It will advance our understanding of coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice processes with a focus on the role and response of cyclones in altering the state of the Arctic system. A cyclone tracking scheme will be applied to reanalyses, yielding an inventory of Arctic cyclone locations, tracks, and intensities that will provide a framework for analysis of ice and upper-ocean responses to storms. The responses of ice concentration, ocean temperature and salinity, and associated ice mass balance before, during, and after cyclones at a variety of intensities will be documented. The same analysis will be applied&#8232;to output from the high-resolution Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) and to output from&#8232;a suite of global climate models (GCMs). Using a novel set of metrics computed from the output of RASM, peak temporal and spatial scales of oceanic mixing, sea ice deformation, and turbulent fluxes associated with the passage of storms in the Arctic will be determined, in order to assess coupled cyclone-ocean-sea ice processes. Changes in the cyclone climatology between pairs of coupled RASM simulations, that differ only in sea ice and ocean state, and in current and end of the 21st century CMIP5 simulations will allow for assessment of cyclone response to changing ocean and ice state.

However, while ongoing climate warming and permafrost thaw are expected to increase plant productivity (CO2 uptake), continued warming is also expected to weaken prior constraints on decomposition (CO2 emissions). The net effect of these changes on the Arctic?s carbon budget and the global climate system are poorly understood, as most observations have been made during the short growing season, when root and rhizosphere respiration dominate CO2 emissions.  This project will focus on the development of a new technology for the continuous collection of CO2 emitted from arctic tundra soils. This passive diffusive sieve (zeolite) trap for measuring soil respired CO2 will be rugged, small, lightweight, low-cost, and require little in the way of power (batteries) low power.  It has the potential to transform our understanding of carbon cycling in the Arctic, as it allows for the year-round CO2 collection, including during the winter and shoulder seasons when sites are often inaccessible, and over multiple weeks (3 weeks/sample), thus integrating both diffusive and episodic emissions.  Outreach activities will strengthen the existing NSF-supported K-12 training programs at UC Irvine that are aimed to increase the participation of underprivileged populations in the STEM fields. THE Investigators will engage middle school students with lab tours and activities during a ?Day at College?-experience and class room visits. The project will also train a graduate student, and contribute to educating researchers (via an international summer course) in the use of 14C analysis in Ecology and Earth System Science.<br/><br/>The investigators will develop and deploy a novel system to continuously trap CO2 emitted from arctic tundra soils over several weeks for radiocarbon (14C) analysis.  However, typical canister-based systems for measuring soil respired CO2, can be relatively large, expensive to ship, and require line power.  This project will develop and deploy a novel system to continuously trap CO2 emitted from Arctic tundra soils over several weeks for radiocarbon (14C) analysis.  This continuous collection system has the potential to transform carbon cycle research.  Such devices would obviate the need for shipping large canisters to the Arctic as well and the need for line power.  Moreover, such devices are relatively inexpensive and lightweight, and therefore, permit for high spatial resolution monitoring.  These new traps, however, have never been tested in the Arctic, where the environmental conditions can be harsh, especially in winter.  Thus the focus of this work is to develop, harden, and test such devices through a number of winter seasons at the Toolik Lake Long Term Ecological Station, on the north slope of Alaska.  If successful, this device will provide the first year-round, quasi-continuous dataset on soil-respired 14CO2 in moist acidic tussock tundra, which is the dominant tundra type of arctic Alaska and globally accounts for over 20% of the tundra land surface.  Moreover, this research will point the way for other experimental groups working in similar harsh environments throughout the Arctic."

This research effort will synthesize a number of recent, upcoming, and historical datasets to create three regional carbon budgets for the Chukchi/western Beaufort Sea, the Bering Sea, and the northern Gulf of Alaska. As waters from the North Pacific make their way through these regions a number of transformations occur that modify them before they enter the central Arctic Ocean. In general, the waters exiting these shelf seas are fresher, colder, and have lower pH due to the uptake of CO2 and the remineralization of organic matter. Because of the importance that biogeochemical transformations have in preconditioning the waters of the central Arctic and ultimately parts of the North Atlantic it is important to gain a better understanding of how these processes impact the carbon biogeochemistry of the region. The investigators propose to address this issue by better constraining the carbon budgets for three zones in the Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean including coastal fluxes, rates of primary production and air-sea exchange of CO2 as well as developing algorithms with predictive capabilities for carbonate mineral saturation states. The aim of this effort is to determine how physical forcing and biological responses control the marine carbon cycle including the rates of air-sea CO2 exchange and net community production as well as ocean acidification effects in the contrasting shelf environments, and to better constrain the present stocks and fluxes of carbon and determine how climate change will affect the regional carbon cycle. The project will support four early career investigators, a postdoctoral scientist, and a Ph.D. student."

It has been known for sometime that unusual chemistry takes place during sunrise at high northern latitudes, in which chemistry involving bromine leads to boundary layer ozone destruction, and deposition of mercury.  The details of the source of the bromine and the exact chemical mechanisms are still under study.  The deposition of mercury is a potential environmental hazard, and thus it is important to understand the details of the processes.  This study will attempt to quantify the functional dependence of mercury deposition and halogen abundance on distance from the ocean source region, meteorology, and other factors.  This project leverages the existence of the Barrow Arctic Mercury Study (BAMS) that will provide infrastructure and detailed chemical and physical measurements at Barrow, Alaska, and will extend BAMS through geographical sampling of snow in the region south and west of Barrow.  In addition, satellite observations of bromine monoxide (BrO) will be used to track the evolution of ozone depletion events and to help plan the snow sampling periods.<br/><br/>The snow samples will be collected along three transects between Barrow, Wainwright, and Atqasuk.  The three villages form a triangle with legs approximately 100 km long.  Barrow and Wainwright sit on the shore of the Arctic Ocean, while Atqusuk lies inland.  The hypothesis that the chemistry responsible for ozone depletion and mercury deposition is limited by availability of bromide ion in the snow will be rigorously tested by this experiment.  Studies will be performed after sunrise, but well before the active ozone depletion period, near equinox when depletion chemistry is very active, and late in the spring when ozone depletion has ended but snow remains on the ground.  The snow will be sampled for a number of quantities including mercury, ions and the deuterium and oxygen isotopic composition of water.  These measurements will allow the quantification of the target quantities (mercury and bromide) as well as species that will aid in correlating specific snow layers at the different sites.<br/><br/>This project will improve understanding of the mechanism of mercury deposition and be of benefit to the inhabitants of regions impacted by this springtime phenomenon.  The spatial extent and intensity of mercury deposition will be studied in the region.  This will lead to better understanding of the global mercury budget.  The budget provides graduate student support, and the PIs intend to make presentations on their research at the three remote villages bounding the study region, thereby improving public understanding of the relevant issues."

This research will use the responses of parsley ferns (Cryptogramma species) growing in eastern Asia and western North America to rapid climate change during the Last Glacial Maximum as a model for predicting how today?s flora will survive anthropogenic climate change.  These parsley ferns today span the area known as Beringia, which stretches from northeastern Asia across the Bering Sea into central Alaska and was subject to rapid climate change during the Last Glacial Maximum.  By using large amounts of DNA sequence data, researchers will quantify patterns of genetic diversity across the landscape and examine the relative importance of surviving in a small number of refugial regions that can serve as sources for recolonization or migration versus surviving on numerous isolated mountaintops during the Last Glacial Maximum for these parsley ferns. Populations that are in particular danger of extinction from present day climate change will be identified for special conservation attention. <br/> <br/> The public and broader scientific community will benefit from this research in many ways.

The cause of this advance is related to the advance phase of the ""tidewater glacier cycle"". A 19th century calving retreat resulted in a high area accumulation ratio (AAR) during most of the 20th century (~ 0.90). The high AAR and gradual diminishment of calving due to infilling of the fjord by glacial and fluvial sediments resulted in a positive net balance for several decades, driving the current advance 7 kilometers (km) since 1890. Taku Glacier therefore presents an ideal setting and rare opportunity for the study of slow glacier advance onto and into soft sediments. Continued thickening of ice in the terminus region indicates this advance should continue over the next several years. Reconnaissance observations have documented contemporaneous deformation of proglacial sediments about 200 meters (m) in front of the terminus and prominent bulges up to 10 m high have formed in the compressed sediments with buckling of the overlying soil and vegetation. The Principal Investigators will study the dynamics of the advancing glacier terminus and investigate the effects of this advance on the proglacial geomorphology.  Surface velocities, strain rates, and surface elevation changes will be measured both on the glacier terminus and on proglacial features, along with measurements of changes in terminus position. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) and radio echo sounding (RES) will be used to define the glacier geometry and the nature of the bed. They will repeat RES surveys to investigate ongoing subglacial sediment excavation and entrenchment. GPR will also be used to develop a 3-dimensional picture of the structure of the proglacial sediments and their deformation. Existing and new markers on the sediments will measure motion and strain. A key feature of this study will be simultaneous measurement of short-term changes in terminus ice speed and proglacial sediments using precision GPS over several months. Terminus dynamics and the mass balance are integral parts of glacier response theories, but they are poorly understood. The Principal Investigators will use finite element analyses to investigate the deformation and stress fields in the terminal ice wedge and of the sub- and proglacial sediments, using strain data and geometry as constraints. Their aim is to understand the detailed dynamics of terminus advance and the rheological properties of the sediments and the ice near the terminus. They will also investigate the relation between glacier thickening and terminus advance, using our continuing airborne altimetry and photogrammetric measurements of surface elevation.<br/><br/><br/>"

Massive ice in the form of ice wedges occupies 10?70% of near- surface permafrost and fundamentally influences the dynamics and vulnerability of arctic ecosystems to climate change. Arctic permafrost has been considered stable because ground temperatures remain low, but recent observations in northern Alaska of an abrupt increase in degradation of ice-wedges, indicate that even permafrost in the Arctic is susceptible to degradation from climate change because of the massive ice that has formed just below the active layer. High-resolution satellite images of Alaska and Russia reveal that ice-wedge degradation is more extensive in the Arctic than in the subarctic because of this near-surface ice. The dynamics of ice-wedge degradation has been shown to be affected by the positive feedback of impounded surface water and negative feedbacks from rapid vegetation and peat accumulation that are able to stabilize degrading ice wedges, yet there has been no quantification of the physical mechanisms controlling the processes. This degradation of ice wedges greatly affects arctic ecosystems by altering surface topography, modifying drainage networks, enhancing peat accumulation and methane production under anaerobic conditions, and radically shifting vegetation composition, but these consequences are poorly understood. Given that ice-wedge degradation directly or indirectly affects most arctic terrain it is critical to quantify the dynamics and consequences of ice-wedge degradation.<br/><br/>This project addresses these uncertainties through a comprehensive assessment of the nature and extent of ice-wedge degradation, the feedbacks controlling ice-wedge dynamics, and the consequences of degradation on ecosystem patterns and processes. The research brings together an interdisciplinary team with expertise in permafrost and soil, biogeochemisty and trace gas emissions, vegetation, and remote sensing to address hypotheses through field surveys, remote sensing, and modeling. The extent and rate of ice-wedge degradation across landscapes and climates will be assessed by comparing the ice-wedge volume by terrain units, describing stages of degradation and stabilization; quantifying degradation across the circumarctic; developing image processing algorithms for mapping thermokarst; and quantifying degradation rates through aerial photo analysis. How the dynamics of ice- wedge degradation and stabilization are controlled by positive and negative feedbacks will be assessed by identifying structural properties of surface soils that protect ice wedges; quantifying differences in net radiation and soil heat flux among degradation stages; and identifying thresholds for thermokarst through numerical modeling. The consequences of ice-wedge degradation will be documented by quantifying micro-topographic changes caused by ice-wedge degradation; changes in surface water storage and drainage patterns; soil-organic carbon stocks through degradation sequence; differences in methane emissions among degradation stages; and quantifying shifts in vegetation composition through degradation sequence. <br/><br/>The research is essential for understanding of the effects of climate changes on permafrost and arctic ecosystems because ice wedges are especially sensitive component of terrestrial arctic ecosystems. Knowledge of the nature and extent of ice wedges will improve land management, impact assessment, and facility design in ice-rich permafrost terrain. Information on the dynamics and feedbacks involved in ice-wedge degradation is needed to minimize effects of disturbance and to improve global climate change models that currently lack critical feedbacks. Documentation of the consequences of degradation is needed to better assess the role of fragmenting drainage networks in assessments of circumarctic hydrology, help resolve whether arctic soils will gain or lose carbon in the future, contribute information for assessing methane emissions across dynamically changing ecosystems, and provide data on the rates of vegetation change which can affect satellite measurement of vegetation productivity during assessments of vegetation greening in the Arctic."

A team of US and Russian scientists is using a combination of GPS surveys around and within the Bering Sea and data from the EarthScope PBO to resolve a fundamental question: does the Bering Plate exist? If not, how large is the mobile sliver of crust in the southern Bering Sea? These observations can test hypotheses that underlie tectonic models for a significant area at the northwestern corner of the North American plate, and the answers are important for understanding the forces that drive motion of small plates.

Implemented as a metaphor in this project, the Modern Blanket Toss is the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a tool to help young Alaskan Natives gain an understanding of their environment and to further their knowledge of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).  The project serves rural populations and Alaskan Natives through the use of technology that can directly improve Alaskans? awareness of their environment and its changes: UAVs and geographic information systems (GIS) technology. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The project aims is to demonstrate a three-part program of science education built around cutting-edge STEM technologies, science communication and leadership skills, and community involvement.  Its goal is to better expose rural and Alaskan Native students to STEM careers, prepare them for higher education, and enable them to contribute to their communities. The project is based on current educational research demonstrating the need to integrate traditional classroom instruction with activities designed to turn knowledge into action. The program combines cybertechnology, small-group and hands-on instruction, and innovative concepts of community engagement. The project partners with Upward Bound, a US Department of Education program with the proven ability to propel high school students into college, and leverages that success to focus on the specific goal of increasing student interest in STEM majors and careers.  The project also includes teacher professional development for rural high school teachers. A thorough evaluation ensures that results from the program are tracked with scientific rigor. Given Alaska?s pressing need for mapping and environmental monitoring, engaging high school students in UAV projects significantly increased the state?s GIS datasets as the students themselves move into STEM careers.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The Modern Blanket Toss project is designed to directly improve the 60 participating students' interest in STEM fields, expanding their horizons like the ancient Inuit practice from which the project draws its name. It is also transferable and scalable for broad application in Upward Bound programs across the US. A key product is a curriculum and video series detailing the program's strategies to increase STEM engagement in underserved populations. Though these products address programs that focus on UAVs, they can potentially encompass a much broader educational strategy in which any number of science activities could substitute for UAV education. Results are to be widely disseminated through both Alaska's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) network and Upward Bound media and events, including a national workshop held at the conclusion of the award period."

A key element in understanding soil freezing and thawing processes is the ability to predict the mass fraction and mobility of unfrozen water (that is, how much water remains liquid at below-freezing temperatures within frozen soils, and how it moves).  Historically, microscale phenomena associated with unfrozen water has been challenging to measure and poorly understood.  This research uses an innovative combination of state-of-the-art measurement techniques to quantify relationships among hypothesized key variables in soil freezing and thawing processes, namely unfrozen water content and mobility, soil zeta potential (a parameter related to mineral surface charge), and soil micro-fabric.  Specifically, the PI will (1) measure mass and molecular mobility of unfrozen water in frozen cation-treated soils using pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods; (2) correlate these with measurements of soil micro-aggregate formation and micro-fabric using X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) methodologies; and (3) correlate these measurements to zeta potential of cation-treated soil particles at sub-freezing temperatures.  Students recruited from the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program (ANSEP) will participate in this CAREER research and in K-8 outreach through a hands-on geotechnical engineering module delivered to middle school-aged students.<br/><br/>The ability to accurately predict heat and mass balance of frozen soil systems, frozen soil strength, and frost heave magnitude - all of which depend on unfrozen water - will support planning for permafrost response to climate change, and will facilitate more efficient and economic engineering design for cold regions.  Results from this CAREER research may be used to improve heat and mass transport models, frost heave models, and models of frozen soil creep by incorporating enhanced unfrozen water content functions, which will account for unfrozen water mobility and its dependence on soil-specific physicochemical properties.  The improved models will have far-reaching effects, including:  contributing to the scientific community studying methane release from degrading permafrost; serving as planning tools for Arctic communities that must relocate due to unstable permafrost; increasing the analysis accuracy of unstable slopes in frozen ground; resulting in more cost-effective designs accompanied by less structural damage and safety risks for projects such as buried chilled gas pipelines; and predicting frost heave susceptibility and magnitude more accurately, which will support design of safer, more durable roads in cold regions.<br/><br/>In terms of education, involving ANSEP students in this research will encourage underrepresented student groups to become engineering professionals with strong outreach skills, who can return to rural Alaska to inspire the next generation of engineers.  Increasing the involvement of Alaskan Native students in frozen ground engineering will result in a stronger, highly-trained workforce, capable of addressing geotechnical problems unique to the Arctic, which is critical for the long-term viability of their communities and for the successful development of the Arctic, the next frontier in energy resource development.  Exposing middle school-aged students to hands-on engineering activities and to problems germane to their local environment will promote an early interest in engineering that can segue into an engineering career."

The ability to accurately determine hypocentral                      parameters would be achieved by using a) a realistic two-                       dimensional model of the volcano's seismic velocity structure                   and b) both travel time and amplitude data of seismic waves                     recorded at seismic stations on the volcano.  Preliminary results               using data from an eruption in 1976 indicate that amplitude data                from forward modeling based on the Gaussian beam method might                   provide a powerful means of constraining focal depth.  The                      potential of that method for volcano seismology requires detailed               exploration, which we propose to conduct in this investigation.                 Magma movement up the conduit of a central stratovolcano always                 produces microearthquake activity due to fracture propagation,                  dike emplacement, brecciation of host rocks and eventually vent                 excavation.  Precise location (especially of depth) of precursor                earthquakes prior to eruptions can give important clues about                   the evolution of the physical/chemical instability in the magma                 reservoir that eventually erupts.  If we succeed in developing                  an earthquake location scheme that is highly sensitive to depth                 of focus it could have an important application for eruption                    prediction."

Identifying the source and localizing it is a challenge with many different applications.  The Infrasound group at UAF has operated arrays in Alaska and Antarctica for several years. The primary arrays are comprised of eight microphones arranged to obtain wide-band operation with no spatial aliasing over the frequency band of interest. These arrays are operated and maintained by the UAF group as part of the International Monitoring System (IMS) of the United Nations Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Office (CTBTO).  A second array of four microphones is operated by the UAF group as a research array. The group has used this array to test methods of wind-noise reduction, microphone performance and array performance under varying array geometries.  As part of the process of identifying infrasound signal sources a prototype locator algorithm was developed that allows estimation of the range to the signal source for locations of the signals source of up to 10 to 15 times the array diameter. The locator algorithm has been used extensively in cases where signal-to-noise levels are high and it appears to be robust. Investigators will continue to study the method and investigate its behavior under a range of signal-to-noise conditions, as well as develop an estimator of the variance in the estimates of range and azimuth.  <br/><br/>The description and classification of signal sources will improve the ability to discriminate against known natural and man-made sources in signal detection operations. The development of an algorithm to estimate source range to accompany the traditional azimuth estimates will also benefit the general area of source localization using acoustic methods.

While recording interviews during previous fieldwork (summers of 2006 and 2007) in Scammon Bay, a Central Yup'ik community of 450 people, located on the southwestern shore of the Bering Sea in Alaska, the CoPI Katrin Simon noted an emergent theme in oral accounts, that of the ""fireballs."" These are a form of dangerous sea creatures who visit the village in the form of fiery balls or burning hands and kill ill-mannered community members. Contemporary Scammon Bay residents fear attacks by these sinister ancestral beings and employ the fireball story to explain bad luck, social malaise, conflict and death. <br/><br/> By researching the history of this tale and recording its contemporary range of expressions, Simon will investigate how narrative and artistic production reflects and shapes the social realities of contemporary Yup'ik life. The history of contact in southwestern Alaska has been one of acute disruption brought on by the introduction of Western belief and political-economic systems. It is hypothesized that the ""fireball phenomenon"" acts as a central metaphor, articulating for the people of Scammon Bay modern-day social ills in a non-disruptive fashion; thus strengthening Yup'ik peoples? resilience in circumstances of rapid social change. The ""fireball story"" is said to provide healing for the community, offering a way to articulate societal tensions. By analyzing the connection between creative activities, colonial history and conflict resolution, this project explores the way Yup'ik people use art and storytelling to renew relationships to their traditional culture and redefine both past and present."

For isolated northern communities lacking road beds or power line routes to the outside world, standard cable burial techniques are not cost-effective. Installing fiber optic cable directly on the ground surface without burial in extreme northern climates poses several engineering and environmental issues that must be investigated, including wild fire, animals, vegetation impact, thermal strain, river ice, off-road vehicle traffic, and lightning. The overall objective is to determine whether this installation technique is feasible by addressing these issues with field and laboratory tests. The project has six primary goals. (1) Perform a literature survey of past experience in similar installations with electric power cable and pipelines. (2) Perform industry standard characterization measurements of the fiber optic cable performance using an optical time domain reflectometer and optical spectrum analyzer. (3) Measure and record any signs of deterioration and/or damage to the cable exterior armor due to the harsh Arctic environment. (4) Observe and assess the environmental impact of the surface laid cable on the tundra vegetation. (5) Design and test a suitable anchoring system for stream and river crossings that can withstand ice rafting during spring melt. (6) Document and assess the impact of wild animals on the cable, and any reciprocal hazards the cable may pose to the wildlife. At the end of the two-year project, a recommendation as to the feasibility of this installation technique will be made based on a synthesis of all measurement data and observations. A detailed report on the field and laboratory tests, results, and conclusions will be written. The broader impact of this project is in helping to find a cost-effective way to bring high speed broadband communication to rural Alaska, and to remote research stations. If this project demonstrates that fiber optic communication can be brought to rural high northern Alaska, it will make a significant contribution to helping rural communities participate in the broader community, national forums, and the global economy."

These conditions make any observation difficult, but pose particular difficulties for autonomous sensors. To date, most long-term Arctic atmospheric observations, and in particular most chemistry data, have been collected on land, although the Arctic Ocean and its sea ice cover modify the climate and atmospheric composition of the entire region. It is known that surface chemistry involving sea salt results in destruction of ozone (O3) and elementary mercury (Hg) at the surface during spring time in the Arctic. However, due to the logistics challenge of long term measurements, there have been very few such measurements of O3 or other chemical species in the atmosphere above the Arctic Ocean surface (except from satellites and aircraft). Because of new developments in instrumentation, power management, and instrumentation control, there is a new opportunity to realize this goal through development of robust, unattended, self-contained and autonomous buoys. <br/><br/>Long-term, ocean-based atmospheric data sets are needed to quantify seasonal and interannual variability in a fast changing ice field that will vary in different regions of the Arctic Ocean. To further this goal, the project will integrate 3 different chemical measurement instruments aimed at key gases, into weather-tight, self-powered, ice-tethered buoys; two of these specialized buoys will be field tested at Barrow, Alaska. This development will improve understanding of the fundamental chemical and physical processes, and improve the understanding of how atmosphere-surface interactive processes respond to Arctic System-wide changes in physical and climatic conditions. The O-Buoy instrument package will initially consist of three sensors: 1) a MAX-DOAS BrO instrument, 2) an O3 detector, and 3) a CO2 analyzer. <br/><br/>In year 1 an autonomous buoy will be developed with instruments that are robust, low power, with a data/power/instrument control management system package that allows computer control for periodic operation, and data transmission via the Iridium satellite system. It year 2 and 3 there will be initial testing and refinement at Barrow, Alaska. To achieve this goal, we plan on coordination with collaborating researchers as part of the Ocean-Atmosphere-Sea Ice-Snowpack (OASIS) program (http://www.OASIShome.net).<br/><br/><br/>"

While phylogenetic inference will be the main focus of the project, data will bear significantly on the understanding of historic patterns of biotic change at the global level, and will provide insight into the origins of many important plant traits, including those that are the basis of breeding programs in horticulture and forestry. In addition to training students, workshops for K-12 teachers will be held at several botanic gardens.<br/>"

We plan to capitalize on the recent progress using the conformal method to obtain new existence results in the  nonconstant mean curvature (non-CMC) setting, to understand the limits of these methods, and then to develop alternate techniques toward these same goals, including degree theory, a priori estiimates, and gluing methods. The Lichnerowicz equation, central  to the conformal method, is a semilinear elliptic equation. Due to  the mixed sign of its nonlinear exponents, it is of a type not yet fully understood. The full Lichnerowicz-Choquet-Bruhat-York set of equations is a more difficult coupled system which incorporates  features presenting new analytic subtleties. The ultimate aim is to  provide a complete parametrization of initial data sets, particularly  in the non-CMC setting, not only on compact backgrounds but also  for manifolds with asymptotically Euclidean, hyperbolic or cylindrical ends, all of which are highly relevant for physical applications.  In exploring new methods, we plan to use new and advanced analytical tools, as well as increasingly accurate and flexible numerical simulation techniques. Technical advances made in the course of  this project should have a substantial application to many other  equations of this general type which play important roles in other  parts of pure and applied mathematics and mathematical physics. <br/><br/>Einstein's gravitational field theory is a remarkably accurate mathematical model of gravitational physics, which does an excellent job  of predicting and modeling gravitational phenomena at both the  astrophysical and cosmological scales. It is consistent with every  known gravitational observation and experiment. From the point of  view of underlying mathematics, Einstein's theory involves two very  distinct types of equations. The study of dynamics of gravitational  fields involves the analysis of the Einstein equations as a nonlinear  system of time-dependent evolution partial differential equations  (PDE), while the study of initial data sets representing gravitational states involves Riemannian geometry and the study of the Einstein  constraint equations as a nonlinear system of time-independent  PDE.The last decade has witnessed remarkable progress in under- standing both equations. This project focuses on developing a  more complete understanding of the constraint equations. The study of the Einstein equations presents a very important point of contact  between mathematics and physics, one which has motivated many  advances in differential geometry and PDE on the one side, and  which also has provided a compelling and accurate model of the  physical world, both on the astrophysical and on the cosmological  scales. This project has the potential for settling significant open  questions in this area."

Topics of study include:(1)the geometrical <br/>characteristics and spatial distribution of brine drainage networks and <br/>their relationship to the crystal structure of the ice, (2) the 3-dimensional characterization of brine and gas inclusions,(3)variations in permeability through the year and the resulting impact on heat and mass transfer through the ice, and (4)details of the relationship between c-axis fabrics and under-ice currents. Knowledge of these is important for studies of the optical and mechanical properties of sea ice, biological activity in sea ice, remote sensing applications, some aspects of climate modeling, and the entrainment and transport of contaminants.<br/> <br/>The main activity of this project will be the acquisition and analysis of<br/>detailed observations relevant to the structural features listed, along with <br/>in-situ permeability measurements. The samples and data will be collected <br/>periodically through the year from a study site on first-year sea ice near <br/>Barrow, Alaska. The site will be instrumented to continuously monitor the <br/>thermal regime of the ice, and other relevant parameters will be measured <br/>periodically through the year. The scale of the features to be studied ranges from individual brine inclusions (approximately 10-4 m) to the full thickness of the ice sheet. Current information on these subjects comes mainly from short-term field studies (although there are some notable exceptions) which often involve relatively thin ice, or studies on laboratory-prepared specimens. To some extent, this reflects the difficulty of obtaining information on natural <br/>first year ice sheets as they evolve through the year from initial freezing <br/>to melting. The main problems in this regard are the remoteness of the field <br/>areas and the expense of getting to them, coupled with the lack of appropriate methodologies for collecting samples other than by relatively small-diameter corers. However, this project makes use of recent advances in techniques for sampling, measuring and testing for the relevant parameters, some of which the investigators helped to develop. In addition, the presence of the Barrow Arctic Science Consortium (BASC) as a reliable source of local personnel to assist in data gathering allows frequent visits to the site to be made for routine data collection or sampling. These data collection efforts will maintain continuity between and after 3 additional field programs of approximately 10 days each, during which extensive data sets will be acquired. These programs will be timed to conduct detailed studies of the ice at the site shortly after it forms, under cold, mid-winter conditions, and at the start of the melt season. In addition to the usual salinity, density, grain size and c-axis fabric measurements, specialized observations will include the permeability measurements and associated detailed measurement of drainage pathways, sets <br/>of orthogonal micrographs (which yield size distributions of small-scale <br/>inclusions in 3-dimensions), ocean current measurements, and vertical <br/>sections through the entire thickness of the ice sheet. The latter provide a <br/>unique view of larger-scale features such as brine drainage networks and <br/>horizontal banding. The data will be used to develop or evaluate and improve <br/>existing salt-flux/thermodynamic ice growth models. <br/><br/><br/>"

Observations include large and systematic changes in the active layer, a large amount of unfrozen water in the frozen active layer, near-surface permafrost at some sites, and large spatial gradients in the active layer and permafrost surface temperatures.  These changes indicate that the current understanding of climate-active layer interactions are not well understood.  Warmer temperatures from increased greenhouse gases have been predicted in the Arctic.  These temperature changes  could cause permafrost to thaw as the active layer becomes thicker.  A better understanding of the relationships among the atmosphere, soil surface active layer, and permafrost is required to interpret the rate and extent of permafrost degradation, modifications to its regime, release of carbon and trace gases by thawing permafrost, changes in soil moisture, and the hydrological cycle. <br/><br/>This proposed research contains field and laboratory measurements, and analyses and interpretations of the data which will be obtained from six long-term study sites along a transect from Prudhoe Bay across the coastal plain and to the foothills of the Brooks Range.  These sites are in undisturbed areas and span a wide range of permafrost, climatic, and environmental conditions.  They have a relatively long term data base (since 1983).

Ice flow near a divide such as Siple Dome is  unique in that it is predominantly vertical.  As a consequence,  the component of ice deformation in the vertical direction, the  ""vertical strain rate""  is dominant.  Its measurement is  therefore important for the calibration of dynamic models of ice  flow.  Two different, relatively new, high resolution systems for  its measurement in hot water drilled holes will be employed.  The  ice flow model resulting from the measurements and flow law  determination will be used to interpret the shapes of radar  internal layering in terms of the dynamic history and  accumulation patterns of Siple Dome over the past 10,000 years.  The resulting improved model will also be applied to the  interpretation of annual layers thicknesses (to produce annual  accumulation rates) and borehole temperatures from the ice core  to be drilled at Siple Dome during the 1997/98 field season.  The  results should permit an improved analysis of the ice core,  relative to what was possible at recent coring sites in central  Greenland.

The research program will be conducted for 14 months from a ship frozen into the ice pack. These investigators will measure near-surface atmospheric conditions of the region from the cloud base to the surface of the permanent ice cap of the Arctic Ocean using an instumented research balloon during a period from Spring to Fall.  The research will be conducted in conjunction with a DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement research program jointly conducted at the site. These researchers will determine the vertical profile of temperature and humidity as a function of changing cloud conditions. Their results will help determine how atmospheric heating is coupled to adsorption of heat by the ice. These measurements are critical to understanding how heat is reflected or absorbed by the ice as it melts in the summer and thickens in the winter in response to seasonal variations in climate, especially changing cloud conditions. The balloon measurement program makes an essential contribution to the SHEBA team of researchers who will measure atmospheric variables with a large array of instruments on the ice floe and aircraft flying above, as well as ice and ocean property measurements made on and below the ice floe. The combined set of measurements in SHEBA will allow refinement of climate models for the Arctic region. Those improved models will lead to better predictions of the climate and the permanence of the Arctic ice cap under a proposed global warming that could occur if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are increased above present levels."

One of the major challenges facing humanity is to sustain the desirable features of Earth's ecosystems and society at a time of rapid changes in all of the major forces that shape the structure and functioning of ecosystems and society.  The RR&A program seeks to train Ph.D.-level scholars, policy-makers, and managers to address these questions in an integrated fashion.  The program integrates the tools and approaches of ecology, economics, anthropology, climate dynamics, and philosophy in a systems framework to understand the functioning of regional systems.  It emphasize high-latitude ecosystems, where current management issues require an application of the integrated understanding of these disciplines.  This graduate-training program will train a new generation of scientists to integrate the perspectives of natural and social sciences in addressing both the basic understanding of regional systems and the application of this understanding to management issues.  The goal is to train scientists that are well-grounded in one or more disciplines but have an understanding and research experience in a range of natural and social sciences.  The program will provide training to graduate students from the University of Alaska and students enrolled in other universities.  It provides course work and a seminar program that integrates ecology, economics, and anthropology in a systems-modeling framework and provides faculty mentorship and internships in areas outside of each student's parent discipline.  The program emphasizes cross-cultural communication through heavy involvement with the Alaskan Native American community and with managers, businesses, and conservation groups.<br/><br/>IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the multidisciplinary backgrounds and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing new, innovative models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. In the fourth year of the program, awards are being made to twenty-two institutions for programs that collectively span all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF. The intellectual foci of this specific award reside in the Office of Polar Programs and the Directorates for Geosciences; Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences; and Education and Human Resources.<br/>"

It is probably the strongest doublet (thrust faulting on a subduction interface followed by normal faulting beneath the outer rise) ever observed by space geodetic methods. The Kuril GPS Array of continuous stations was installed several months before the great earthquakes as a collabora-tive effort of Russian and US scientists. Inversions of coseismic offsets observed on the array showed that highest-slip patches, or asperities, from the 2006 and 2007 earthquakes are adjacent to each other. This correlation suggests that the 2007 extensional event was triggered by redis-tribution of stresses following the 2006 thrust event. We are exploring the stress changes and triggering further.<br/><br/>Our target in the proposal is to extend the GPS monitoring and theoretical analysis to a cru-cially important period of 3-4 years since the events. In the first few years after a great earth-quake, the postseismic deformation can only be monitored by continuous observations. In 2009, we schedule visits to all continuous stations on uninhabited central Kuril islands, where the postseismic effect is the greatest, to guarantee that they are working, download data, and pro-vide the extended battery power supply. The postseismic deformation following the Kuril earthquake doublet represents a combination of frictional afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation of stresses in the sublithospheric mantle. The process prevailing after about one year since the earthquake is likely to be viscoelastic relaxation. Our preliminary modeling of this process shows that the mantle rheology proposed in literature for the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earth-quake cannot explain the postseismic data from the Kuril doublet. Models will be explored more fully once we have obtained another year of time series data in the field work to be supported by this proposal. A long-term goal of the project is to develop a consistent model including both afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation following the 2006-2007 earthquakes, and compare this to other events. We will address a fundamental problem, How long-lived is the postseismic de-formation following great 2006-2007 Kuril earthquakes, and how does this compare with events at other subduction zones? Are postseismic models for this sequence consistent with the appar-ent lack of any long-lived postseismic deformation from the 1952 Mw > 9 southern Kamchatka earthquake? It should be noted that two dramatic tectonic events happened in the central Ku-rils within recent months: the 15 January 2009 Mw=7.4 thrust earthquake beneath the outer rise and the 11 June 2009 volcanic explosion on Matua Island. We suppose our network captured surface deformations associated with both events.<br/><br/>This project is a collaboration involving Columbia University, the University of Alaska Fair-banks, and institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The project will continue and strengthen collaborative ties between US and Russian scientists. The results of the project will have an impact on the region subject to disastrous earthquakes. The results from this work and the methods we will develop are expected to lead to generally improved understanding of the earthquake potential of subduction zones and may thus ultimately lead to improved hazard es-timation and mitigation elsewhere."

Also, 17 existing and new GPS sites along the Qinghai-Tibet highway were surveyed in December, 2001. A second field campaign is extending GPS network westward from the Qinghai-Tibet highway, adding new sites along the fault on either side of surface rupture in the near field. This survey is repeating measurements at all of the sites surveyed in November-December, providing the initial postseismic results. These measurements will lead to a better understanding of  the rheological structure of the exceptionally thick northern Tibetan crust as well as the postseismic processes triggered by such a large event."

The purpose of this project is to provide 1) insight from a linear stability analysis into the discriminating properties of the master stability function for transient and asymptotic spatiotemporal chaos for reaction-diffusion networks; 2) a quantification of statistical collapse properties in the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion network; 3) an identification of local dynamical and topological consequences of nonlocal coupling for the asymptotic stability of the global network dynamics; 4) an identification of common mathematical collapse properties and their robustness against nonlocal coupling. 5) benchmark calculations that will provide a first step towards a generalization/classification of transient spatiotemporal chaos in reaction-diffusion networks as a basis for a more general mathematical theory on transient spatiotemporal chaos. <br/>Broader impacts include new insights regarding collapse processes in natural systems, like species extinction in ecology or molecular biology. The educational efforts will focus on research training of diverse undergraduate and graduate students in an interdisciplinary environment where students gain insight into possibilities for diverse careers. Students from other universities will be engaged through the University's REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) program.

This project will capture and sequence the DNA of 2,386 UCE areas of the genome across 18 species (from three organismal classes) in order to test the utility and power of UCEs as universal data markers for organismal population studies.<br/> <br/>UCE's will provide a unique and important new tool for in-depth genetic studies of biodiversity and evolution while also helping to address problems in conservation biology and wildlife management. Development of UCE-based approaches may:   produce data from thousands of  genes across entire orders and classes of organisms; enable previously impossible apples-to-apples comparisons of genomic diversity among thousands of species at a time; and provide quantum increases in speed and decreases in cost for population genomic studies.

Dr. Scott Armbruster of the University of Alaska in collaboration with Dr. Bruce Baldwin of Duke University is reconstructing the phylogeny of Old and New World species of the pantropical plant genus    Dalechampia    (Euphorbiaceae family) in order to gain insights into the evolution of the group's pollination system and its biogeographic history.  Specific objectives include: 1. to collect liquid preserved and herbarium specimens for morphological analysis and for DNA sequencing of chloroplast and nuclear ribosomal genes; 2. to determine the pollination ecology of a sample of Old World taxa, thus complementing knowledge of New World species; 3. to reconstruct the phylogenetic pattern of species divergences using nuclear and chloroplast DNA data and morphology; and 4. to use the phylogeny to trace the biogeographic history of the group and to generate testable hypotheses about change in pollination ecology and floral form.          The application of phylogenetic information to evolutionary biology and ecology has generated considerable excitement in recent times.  Important features of studying evolution with an estimated phylogeny include the ability to infer long term evolutionary history of characteristics not preserved in the fossil record, such as ecological relationships between plants and animals, and to distinguish adaptive evolution from the effects of phylogenetic constraint and past stochastic events.  The Armbruster and Baldwin project will advanc e that agenda."

The research objective is to measure the transport of                 water through the Bering Straits and to determine the influence of              this transport on the physical properties and variability of the                Arctic Ocean, and particularly the surface layer.  These physical               properties, such as ice cover and thickness, vertical mixing, and               thermo-haline structure affect the extent of the Arctic ice pack.               If changing climate conditions caused the ice pack to shrink or                 change significantly, the effect would be felt throughout the                   world's atmosphere and ocean.                                                                                                                                   The influx of water through the Bering Strait is one of the major               inputs to the Arctic Ocean, therefore its volume and physical                   properties must be known if one is to understand the processes that             control the Arctic Ocean's physical features.  Three coordinated                projects will each deal with one or more aspects of the system, and             together provide insight into the broader workings of the Arctic's              physical and geochemical processes.  Moorings will be deployed for              a three-year period at key locations.  They will provide concurrent             time series of water column properties including temperature, sal-              inity, currents and an upward looking sonar (ULS) will make a full              year of ice thickness observations.  A hydrographic program will                also examine water column variability in the northeastern Chukchi               Sea, where the low-salinity portion of the Pacific inflow drains                into the Arctic Ocean.

All are parasitic on fungi at least when seeds germinate, but little is known about this relationship.  Some orchids depend on fungi for all nutrition because they are non-photosynthetic.  Orchids of the genus Corallorhiza are prime examples, comprising 11 species of mainly North American temperate-montane terrestrials.  This group provides a special opportunity to study the changes that happen when plants give up photosynthesis, because at least one species is photosynthetic while others are not.  Such changes include partial loss of chloroplast DNA, structural modifications of the plant, and shifts among the groups of their associated fungi.  Reconstructing phylogenetic relationships among populations of the species of Corallorhiza and their fungi through analysis of DNA sequences will reveal to what extent the orchid-fungal association is essentially random vs.  targeted to certain fungal groups; adding orchid morphology and locality data will show whether shifts in fungal utilization are at all correlated with these factors.  Because of the intensive sampling, any repeated correlations of present-day distribution with lineage histories will be shown, which might reflect post-glacial migration.  This will provide a better understanding of how current plant distributions in North America came to be.  The project incorporates carefully planned fieldwork to obtain both orchid and fungal samples, and brings together the expertise of orchid specialist John Freudenstein at Ohio State University and fungal specialist Donald Taylor at University of Alaska to facilitate a comprehensive analysis that would not otherwise be possible, yielding perhaps the most detailed and multifaceted analysis of a plant-microbe interaction to date.<br/>This project has broad impact for science and beyond in a number of ways.  It provides a synthesis of modern approaches to a detailed analysis of flowering plant-fungal associations, plant morphology, gene lineages and geography.   As such, it may serve as a model for future work on similar systems.  It enhances the infrastructure of science by bringing new collections of these taxa into museums where they have broad accessibility and the DNA sequences generated into public databases where they will be available to all.  The interactions with scientists in China, Korea and Mexico will result in strengthened networks of cooperation.  The project brings together research and education by integrating graduate and undergraduate students in the project.  It further enhances the integration of research and teaching by utilization of the results of the project as a case study in the PIs' teaching in courses on systematics, microbial diversity and symbiosis, and in their outreach to the public at large.  This includes ongoing consultation with forest service botanists on land use planning, as well as presentations to various groups.  Increased understanding of orchid-fungus relationships has direct conservation benefits, since fungal partners are required for orchid germination and growth.  Programs that attempt to maintain or reintroduce endangered species of orchids must address the issue of fungal partner identity and availability. <br/>"

This work is a collaborative effort between the University of Nevada, Dessert Research Institute and the University of Alaska, Geophysical Institute.  Several key atmospheric measurements during the SHEBA field program will be made from tethered balloons that will carry scientific instruments up to a kilometer above the ice surface.  Some of these instruments must be adapted and tested for Arctic conditions.      One group of measurements focus on cloud microphytsics and another group involve radiative heat fluz measurements.  The microphysics instruments will provide characterizations of cloud particles at different altitudes as the balloon moves vertically through cloud layers.  The radiative instrument package will consist of self-leveling up- and down- short-wave flux radiometers, cloud liquid water instruments, and meteorological packages for pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind.  The collaborative effort will provide common operational and data logging components.  Partial support is also being provided by Dept. of Energy."

Wiseman, Jr.","07/31/2007","$198,200.00","","billh.alaska@gmail.com","West Ridge Research Bldg 008","Fairbanks","AK","997757880","9074747301","GEO","5280","0000, 1079, OTHR","$0.00","ABSTRACT<br/>Schulson<br/>OPP-0328605<br/>Hibler<br/>OPP-0328728<br/><br/>The Principal Investigators describe new numerical and laboratory experiments that should elucidates the physical mechanisms that underlie the formation and  subsequent  behavior  of  failure  zones  that  form  within  the annual arctic sea ice cover. The failure zones, termed. linear kinematic features (LKFs), often occur in conjugate sets of sub-parallel faults that traverse a large fraction of the arctic basin. Upon formation, the ice cover generally dilates somewhat and subsequently oscillates, thereby enhancing transfer of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere as well as increasing oceanic salt flux as new ice forms on open water. The LKF.s/faults most probably affect the ice thickness distribution in that, upon subsequent convergence of the ice  pack,  pressure  ridging  occurs.  The lineaments  (and other large-scale  fracture  features)  are similar  in  appearance  to  smaller-scale  compressive  shear  faults  seen  in laboratory specimens, suggesting, when the fractal character of ice breakup is also taken into account, that the physics of fracture is scale independent.   Three different sets of numerical  experiments  will  be  performed.  In the first series, idealized and numerical  grid  experiments  will  be  carried  out  to  examine  the  effect  of  different  flow  rules  on  fault formation and on the attendant weakening of the pack. In the second set, idealized spatially-varying wind forcing will be used with heterogeneous initial strength and a laboratory-generated flow rule to investigate the characteristic opening and closing of deformation faults as well as their angle of intersection. In the third series, high-resolution basin-wide modeling will be performed using a full-thickness ice distribution formulation. These simulations will be compared  with  a  variety  of  recently  acquired  deformation  data, most notably with recently declassified thickness-distribution data from upward-looking submarine sonar observations. Such comparisons will access the utility and applicability of this research to numerical air-ice-ocean models for the numerical investigation of climate. Five sets  of  systematic  biaxial  compressive  experiments  will  be  performed  in  the  laboratory  on blocks of salt-water ice.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: In focusing on the development of a scale-independent sea-ice model, particularly applicable to spatial resolutions less than 10 kilometers and to the resolution of failure zones/faults, this research represents a new paradigm for sea ice dynamics.  Under this paradigm, high internal ice stresses leading to localized fracture occur over short periods of time and rapidly decrease as a fault is formed.    This differs  significantly  from  conventional  formulations  (of  the  ice  pack  and  its  thickness distribution) which are used in current numerical investigations of climate and which implicitly assume a smoothly-varying deformation field in both time and space. The expectation is that the new model will more  realistically  capture  the  distribution  in  sea  ice  thickness  and,  thus,  will  be  more  useful  in  the numerical modeling of climate and its sensitivity to the polar sea ice cover. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The research will constitute an intense intellectual enquiry carried out <br/>with the assistance of graduate students at two universities active in polar research. It will contribute to the intellectual development of a new generation of investigators, as well as enhance the research environment of the two institutions. In addition, through the revelation and understanding of new physical effects, the study  will  enrich  both  the  undergraduate  and  graduate  teaching  of  the  Principal Investigators. The activity will contribute also to a working partnership in polar studies between Dartmouth and The University of Alaska. To enhance scientific and technical understanding, the results of the work will be disseminated broadly, through presentations to workshops and societal meetings and through contributions  to  the  technical  and  scientific  literature.  A review  article  or  book  chapter  is  also planned.   <br/> <br/>"

When NOx is oxidized to nitric acid and deposited to Earth's surface, it contributes acidity and fertilizes ecosystems by adding fixed nitrogen. NOx is removed by reaction with hydroxyl (OH) radicals, primarily in the day, and by conversion to higher nitrogen oxides (NO3 and N2O5) at night. N2O5 then undergoes heterogeneous reaction with water to form nitric acid, providing a ""dark"" pathway for NOx removal. Atmospheric chemistry models indicate that the N2O5 heterogeneous hydrolysis pathway is dominant during high latitude winter, when nights are long and temperatures are low. In this project, the investigators will measure N2O5 mixing ratios along with NOx, ozone, carbon monoxide, aerosol chemical composition, and snow chemical composition in high latitude pollution plumes as a function of distance from the source to understand the mechanism of nighttime nitrogen oxide chemistry. The pollution plume from Fairbanks will be studied by following air masses downwind using an instrumented trailer. The role of snow cover, temperature, and varying day length will be probed by campaigns in fall, winter, and spring.<br/> <br/>Graduate and undergraduate students will play key roles in this project."

The evolution of this annual trans-equatorial migration implies that extraordinary amounts of prey must be readily available to these birds in the Bering Sea.  In 1997 and 1998, unusual weather patterns in the eastern Bering Sea resulted in significant changes in hydrography and water circulation.  The resultant ecosystem anomalies included the first recorded coccolithophore bloom in the Bering Sea, the starvation of about 10% of the migrant shearwaters present, and the collapse in both 1997 and 1998 of the Bristol Bay sockeye salmon fishery.  This research project will continue testing the hypothesis that elevated primary production at the inner front of the southeastern Bering Sea continues longer than in non-frontal waters, and that this production provides an energy source throughout the summer for a food web that supports shearwaters, salmon, and their zooplankton prey.  Based on findings in 1997 and 1998, additional hypotheses concerning the roles of storms and advection of nutrients will be tested using seasonal and inerannual comparisons.  This collaborative study will collect and interpret observations on physical and biological features in the vicinity of the inner front to determine: 1) the availability of nutrients in the euphotic zone, 2) the physical processes responsible for enhanced vertical flux of nutrients, 3) primary production, 4) the distribution, abundance and trophic ecology of near-surface swarms of euphausiids and other macro- and micro-zooplankton, and 5) the distribution, abundance, and foraging ecology of shearwaters, and 6) by stable isotope enrichment, trophic pathways from phytoplankton to shearwaters at and away from the front.<br/><br/>The southeastern Bering Sea supports one of the world's richest fisheries; walleye pollock, salmon, halibut and crab generate over 2 billion dollars in revenue each year.  Despite this, the coastal domain and inner front, where shearwaters, young salmon and some crab larvae congregate to forage, has not been well studied.  The study is important because it will: 1) relate how variation in weather patterns forces physical processes that affect ecosystem function; 2) be the first examination of the physical processes of the inner front during summer and of the role of the front in post-bloom primary production; 3) focus on the ecological role of the extended production, and 4) relate the evolution of trans-equatorial migration patterns of seabirds to biophysical processes that create predictable sources of prey.  These questions are addressed by focusing on species and regions with which the investigators are familiar; however, the results can be applied to numerous continental shelf tidal fronts and species.  Thus, the results should have a general applicability to understanding and managing some of the world's most productive seas.<br/><br/>"

Building on their past research activities in sea ice and ocean data assimilation, they propose to make some first steps toward the creation of an Arctic Climate System Reanalysis that uses modern four-dimensional variational data assimilation methods employing new data assimilation procedures to maximize the integration of model results with observations.  They will focus their attention on three distinct periods, each representing a different state of the Arctic climate. The first period is 1972-1978 when the Arctic was relatively cold and there is a large quantity of hydrographic data available, the second is 1989-1996 when large changes begin in the Arctic Ocean circulation, in its hydrographic structure, and in sea ice conditions, and the third is 1997- present when substantial amounts of open water begin to appear in the late summer. Comparison will be made with new reanalysis products with fields obtained by AOMIP models to validate AOMIP model results. After obtaining the reconstructed solutions with the best fit to the observations, they will focus on the analysis of the sea ice, water circulation, and ocean hydrography during these periods.<br/>Intellectual Merit: Understanding of the Arctic system and its change is an important goal of the SEARCH program. Accurate gridded atmospheric, cryospheric and oceanic fields consistent with and constrained by point observations are important to understanding the origin of past Arctic changes and are essential for forming accurate budgets of climate variables such as heat and freshwater fluxes. Practical implementation of data assimilation methods is necessary to properly understand and model the climate system, and this project will provide the most accurate results possible with modern techniques. These new simulations will help answer a variety of scientific questions of the SEARCH, SBI, and FWI projects and will significantly contribute to national and international components of ASOF and CLIVAR dealing with climate studies. The algorithms tested and validated in this project could also be applied to a reanalysis of the Arctic Ocean during the 2007-2009 IPY and will be used in existing and planned activities of SEARCH, DAMOCLES, COME, CAME and others.<br/>Broader Impact: Data will be available through a web site that will include links to other relevant projects and data, and will be designed to be useful for a variety of audiences including the scientific community, students, and the general public. Interpretations of the results will be published in scientific and popular journals. Educational activities within the project will include training of graduate and undergraduate students at USM and IARC, as well as integration of the material into courses taught at UW, USM and UAF.  Active outreach to grade schools in the Fairbanks and Falmouth area and extensive participation in the Polar Science Weekend at the Pacific Science Center in Seattle will continue.<br/>"

This will be done during two field campaigns. During autumn, the boundary layer is less stratified and a gradient method will be used to quantify the deposition flux of dinitrogen pentoxide to the snowpack. During spring, the boundary layer is often very stratified, allowing sampling of air with little ground contact from a moderate-height tower (10 meters). Visibility measurements and microscopy will be used to quantify suspended ice particle surface area and size distributions. These comprehensive data sets will be used to address the question of what types of ice surfaces are primarily responsible for dinitrogen pentoxide losses during high-latitude nighttime.

The hypothesis that the degree                of nutrient limitation in an ecosystem depends not only upon the                fertility of the site but also upon the responsiveness of the                   vegetation that occupies the site and upon the potential of soil                microorganisms to immobilize nutrients will be tested.

NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, and integrates the co-production of knowledge. This award fulfills part of that aim. <br/> <br/>Arctic ecosystems are transforming at rates that far exceed generations of living memory of Arctic Indigenous residents, resulting in local-to-global impacts. This innovative planning grant centers on collaborative science that incorporates Indigenous values, cultural practices, and frameworks to innovate new forms of scholarship to inform society's most pressing challenges. This project team and partners will develop collaborative learning processes that will center on Indigenous approaches in the sciences, advancing a key goal of the Navigating the New Arctic initiative - the ""co-production of knowledge."" This concept is reflected in the project's title, Atautchikkun Ilitchisukluta, from the Inupiaq language meaning ""coming together to learn."" This approach sets the stage for building responsible, ethical, and intentional relationships merging both Indigenous and western knowledge and science, co-conceiving how to most appropriately address the Arctic's most pressing questions and needs, and thus providing a roadmap towards the implementation of future convergence research. This framework is intended to serve as a blueprint for developing other Arctic research activities. <br/><br/>This project draws upon and strengthens existing relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous university scientists, Indigenous Tribes and organizations, international collaborators, and communities in the Beaufort Sea regions of the U.S. and Canadian Arctic. The project team and partners will undertake an intentional and collaborative year-long planning process to design a multi-day learning event, likely to be hosted in Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), Alaska. Goals of this planning process and learning event are to: (1) Strengthen the relationships necessary for crossing boundaries to co-produce research questions and a project design, which address key changes facing Arctic communities and their coastal ecosystems; (2) Develop a shared mutually respectful process of knowledge co-production and co-create a central conceptual model that will form the centerpiece of a Navigating the New Arctic Track 1 proposal; (3) Provide space for mutual learning through the inclusion and mentorship of Indigenous youth as the next generation of scientists and community leaders. Participants in this project will link deep levels of expertise that span many boundaries, including: Indigenous and western knowledge systems; social, natural, and engineering sciences; U.S., Canadian, Inupiaq, Inuvialuit nations; elders and youth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The group will broadly consider a set of interconnected factors and feedbacks, including changing culture, technology, economics, and governance in addition to climate. The proposal includes a clear plan to integrate co-production of knowledge and to capture the linkage between researchers and native communities. This project may lead to a holistic approach to the evolution of subsistence living in the Arctic and to create a community of practice including Arctic peoples with traditional knowledge and university-trained scientists.<br/><br/>This project is exploring a series of hypotheses designed to stress-test assumptions about the role of rapid physical environmental change in disrupting traditional ways of life for Arctic coastal communities. A community of practice composed of academics from various disciplines and residents of the Arctic communities of Utqiagvik and Kotzebue is being established to consider a central guiding question: How can Alaskan subsistence communities best prepare for and adapt to climate change in a world where nothing else is static? The outcomes of this work include tools and methods for understanding motives of climate adaptations in Alaska Native communities and assessing their effectiveness. The project is also coproducing a plan for future research aimed at improving community and individual resilience in the face of impending Arctic changes<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Stable isotope data from known prey species in each area will be analyzed to construct an isotopic food web to compare with changes in sea otter bone isotope ratios over time. Prehistoric data will come from faunal remains in middens.  Oxygen and carbon stable isotope data from archaeological and modern shells and paleo-proxy data from marine sediment cores will be used to evaluate changes in environment that may have affected nearshore ecosystems.  These data will be used to evaluate mechanistic explanations for the dramatic recent changes in sea otter trophic position and abundance.  One of the extant populations that will be studied is declining, while the other is doing well.  Understanding the mechanisms behind these divergent modern trajectories is of fundamental ecological as well as management interest.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The broader impacts of this project are founded in interdisciplinary research, conservation and management. This will be the first single-system, multiple-geographic, comparison of isotopic records of a keystone species that spans thousands of years. This study will promote interdisciplinary research, collaboration, and education across two universities, a museum, and local schools. Included in this project is an outreach program devised in conjunction with the local museum to provide youth education, participation in an ongoing lecture series for adults, and information on the project and results for the museum's library, which is accessed by both<br/>locals and visitors.

Some of the H atoms have                   sufficient energy to escape the earth completely, and it is in                  this way that the primitive earth lost the large amounts of                     hydrogen to make possible the present oxygen rich atmosphere.                        The hydrogen provides a background medium through which                    energetic charges particles trapped in the earth's magnetic field               (the ring current and Van Allen belts) travel, and collisions                   with the H atoms are the main loss process for the trapped ions                 energized during magnetic storms.  The energetic neutrals                       resulting from such collisions travel on straight line                          trajectories, and can provide, with suitable detectors, ""images""                of the ring current in an analogous way to photons entering a                   camera.

To reconstruct the climate history of the North Pacific, a collaborative Japanese-Alaskan ice core drilling project has been started.  Japanese researchers from Hokkaido University drilled a shallow (50 m) core in the Wrangell caldera and plan to drill a 300m core in 2004. In addition, flow modeling will be done which is instrumental to help date the core, establish the origin of the ice, and calculate historic accumulation rates.  Seismic and radio echo sounding methods will be used to define the geometry of the caldera.  The ice flow velocity will be measured with the GPS method at a stake network, and the same stakes will be used to establish the spatial distribution of accumulation rates.  These measurements allow a calculation of the caldera's mass balance and, therefore, the basal melt rates due to volcanic heat fluxes. The rheological properties of the firn will be constrained by borehole closure and firn compaction measurements.  Temperatures in the borehole will also be monitored. This information will serve as input or test data of a thermo-mechanical finite element model that will be used to interpret the ice core.<br/><br/>INTELLECTUAL MERIT; The Principal Investigators will use field measurements of geometry, present-day flow and accumulation distribution, and rheological firn properties to constrain a time-dependent thermo-mechanical flow model of the Wrangell caldera.  This model will be used to interpret the 300m core and deduce the accumulation history. The accumulation data will be compared to those from Ushkovsky volcano in Kamchatka. The setting is similar to Mt. Wrangell, and the Ushkovsky caldera is located at a similar latitude and altitude on the eastern side of the Pacific Ocean.  There, accumulation rates have been observed to be anti-correlated to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).  This study will fill a gap in the study of the climate history of the North Pacific.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS:  Mount Wrangell is an excellent study area for interdisciplinary sciences. The study will be of interest to meteorologists, because the Wrangell Mountains form a major barrier to Pacific storm tracks, sheltering Alaska's interior. Climatologists will be interested in the accumulation history, its relation to that of Kamchatka and to the PDO. The use of the caldera ice as a calorimeter to deduce geothermal heat flow will be of interest to volcanologists, and the results will be compared to a funded project of measuring melt in the North Crater.  The study will take place within the boundaries of Wrangell St. Elias National Park. The research will form the basis of a PhD thesis.  This project establishes a collaboration with researchers of the Low Temperature Institute in Sapporo, Japan, who will drill and analyze the ice core. For the study and modeling of the firn rheology,  a collaboration exists with VAW, ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Results of the study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and reported at national and international meetings.<br/><br/>"

It is known that control of food consumption depends               on complex interactions between several types of neurochemicals,                including neuropeptides and steroidal hormones.  Based on                       extensive neurobiological data, Dr. Deviche hypothesizes that                   opioids interact with androgens within specific brain cells of                  the hypothalamus, an important neural structure for regulatory                  behaviors.  To test this theory, he will use a combination of                   neuroanatomical, biochemical and behavioral approaches.                         Experiments will identify the specific hypothalamic nuclei that                 opioid peptides act to influence feeding, and where these                       peptides interact with respect to testosterone, the major                       testicular androgen.  Moreover, the unique environment at the                   University of Alaska enables Dr. Deviche to utilize a seasonally                breeding, migratory avian species that undergo extreme seasonal                 changes in testosterone as his model.  He will establish the                    relationship between density of CNS opioid receptors and                        variations within plasma concentrations of this androgen.  It is                likely that these data could ultimately have significance for our               understanding of human eating disorders.  For example, anorexia                 nervosa is a life-threatening eating disorder for which there is                some evidence for opioid and endocrine dysfunctions."

These soils are protected from melting by a surface layer which thaws in summer and refreezes in winter, and a near-surface layer, termed the transition zone. This transition zone, which develops through complex interactions between the environment and permafrost, controls permafrost resilience to ground surface subsidence (thermokarst). Expectations are that as the climate warms, deeper seasonal melting will impact this transition zone, and ecosystems and infrastructure (i.e., roads, airfields, and buildings) stability. The goals of this project are to evaluate the properties of the transition zone from the High Arctic to the southern border of the permafrost region and to understand processes of formation, degradation, and recovery of the transition zone in various climatic regions. The knowledge gained from this work will inform Arctic science and engineering. The project will support student training. The investigators will collaborate with government agencies and engineering companies whose work is impacted by permafrost ground subsidence issues.<br/><br/>In previous research, the investigators identified a zone in the upper profile of permafrost soils that is critical to permafrost stability, soil development, and geomorphic processes. However, how the thickness and cryostructures of this transition zone (TZ) vary across climate and landscape gradients, the rates of its formation during ecological succession, and how it contributes to permafrost vulnerability and resilience, is not well understood. What knowledge we have is in low Arctic tundra and can be misleading if applied to other bioclimatic regions. To address this gap in knowledge, our collaborative research with the University of Montreal will focus on the TZ across climatic regions and landscapes distributed along a north-south transect from barren polar deserts with continuous permafrost in Canada, to boreal forests in southern Alaska with sporadic permafrost. Our group will also monitor and experiment with mass and heat transfer processes between the active layer (AL) and the TZ to identify mechanisms controlling segregated ice formation.<br/><br/>This project was co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Is the Tibetan Plateau rising higher today? Is it growing taller due to ongoing contraction as India continues to collide with Eurasia? Is it collapsing due to extension driven by its excess gravitational potential energy? Is it roughly in balance, no longer growing higher, but simply changing shape? Are parts of the plateau presently evolving in different ways? This project, a joint effort between researchers at the University of Alaska and several Chinese research institutions, aims to address these questions. Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements from the Tibetan Plateau and its surroundings are dense enough and precise enough to make meaningful measurements of vertical motions in Tibet and the rest of the India-Eurasia collision zone. Using several years of GPS data and careful attention to detail in the data analysis, a realistic vertical measurement precision of approximately 1 millimeter per year can be attained even with campaign surveys. Hundreds of campaign GPS sites in China and the rest of the India-Eurasia collision zone now have enough data to provide robust estimates of vertical velocities. These data will be completely reanalyzed the using the next generation of models and orbits, and models to explain the observed rates and spatial variation will be developed. Accuracy will be assessed using vertical rates over a wide area, including regions of no expected deformation, and by comparing estimated GPS vertical motions with complementary data from repeated leveling and InSAR.<br/><br/>The relationship of instantaneous vertical rates to long-term geologic uplift or subsidence rates requires more investigation, and this study will be first to focus on systematic regional measurement and modeling of vertical motions in a region of spectacular active tectonics. Improved understanding of crustal deformation will lead to a better understanding of earthquake hazards in China, a heavily populated region prone to earthquakes. Although this project focuses on vertical motions, we a more precise estimate of horizontal motions will also obtained, and the modeling of elastic deformation using both vertical and horizontal motions may produce significant new understanding of some of the tectonically active regions in China. The occurrence in May 2008 of the devastating Wenchuan earthquake, in a region of slow convergence yet extremely steep topography, drives home the need to better understand deformation processes in China.

Simulation studies will use observational data from ocean stations and hydrological/meteorological stations, tide gauges, current meters, satellites, and drifting buoys to examine the three-dimensional variations in circulation associated with two different postulated climate regimes of circulation. This research project is critical to understanding the role of climate on Arctic Ocean circulation in the context of climate shifts that could occur in response to global change.  Global change is expected to impact the Arctic first and with greater intensity than anywhere else and the Arctic response to climate change must be known in order forecast possible impacts."

The research team is made up of indigenous and non-indigenous researchers who will study the infusion of mathematics in Indigenous Knowledge systems (IKS) and studies how these mathematical knowledge systems are embedded and encoded into everyday activities.   The central hypothesis of this project is that ""...embedded in traditional indigenous knowledge systems--within their worldview, their way of knowing, and their way of doing...are elegant solutions that are mathematically rich."" (from star navigation, to patterns for clothing to building a kayak...)  The project will take place in three different arctic cultural, linguistic, and geographical regions: Yup'ik (Alaska), Sami (Norway and Sweden) and Koryak (Kamchatka) with a comparative site in Yap (a Federated State in Micronesia) as a control group.  The project aims to do more than just document the ethnomathematics; the project will contextualize this kind of knowledge in broader cultural epistemologies and will also examine the indigenous pedagogies by which people learn the activities and the embedded mathematics.  In addition to exploring mathematic conceptualizations the project will also record the language of mathematics, which is endangered among all of these groups and an aspect of language that is rarely captured by linguists working with endangered languages.  Perhaps most importantly, it has the potential to add to human knowledge about how everyday problems and tasks are solved without using Western instrumentation; if similar mathematically-oriented processes are used across project sites this may well suggest will universal concepts rather than culturally particularlistic ones.  Hence, this project has the potential to establish an alternative learning trajectory based on IKS for the teaching of mathematics in indigenous and non indigenous contexts."

Between 1995 and 1999, the U.S. Navy carried out five nuclear submarine cruises to the Arctic Ocean for civilian scientific research through the SCICEX (SCience ICe EXercise) program.  The Seafloor Characterization and Mapping Pods' (SCAMP)instrument package, an integrated geophysical survey system providing gravity, swath bathymetry and sidescan, and chirp sub-bottom profiler data was installed on the submarine for the 1998 and 1999 cruises.  During those two cruises, SCAMP geophysical data were acquired over the major Arctic Ocean floor features.  These data were used to determine the morphology, structure and tectonics of the Gakkel Ridge which occupies a singularly important position as the slowest spreading portion of the global mid-ocean ridge system, and to test the hypothesis of the existence of a Pleistocene Arctic ice sheet by imaging shallow portions of the Arctic Ocean for glaciogenic features.  The purpose of this project is to allow continued mining of this unique and rich data set and to address important questions related to the origin, structure and development of the Amerasian Basin.  The primary foci of the proposed work will be the Lomonosov Ridge, a sliver of continental crust extending  across the Arctic Ocean separating the Mesozoic Amerasian Basin from the Tertiary Eurasian Basin, and the Chukchi Borderland, a high-standing area of extended continental crust jutting into the Canada Basin.  Geophysical studies of the SCICEX data from the Amerasian Basin emphasizing those features allow investigation of a very simple, but unanswered and extremely fundamental question:  How did the Amerasian Basin come into being? The origin and tectonic development of the basin has been very controversial.  Published data from the basin is inconclusive and can be used to support radically different models.   Principal Investigators will determine the structure and the type of rifting and distinguish among the different models.  The Chukchi Borderland is a block of continental crust protruding into the Amerasian Basin.   Different models for the development of the Amerasian Basin propose different modes of formation for the northern and eastern (Northwind Escarpment) margin of the Borderland.  SCAMP data will provide the necessary data to determine the structure of the margin and the form of rifting and to allow further tests for the models for the origin of the basin.<br/>"

Samples will be separated into the soluble and colloidal phase using a new microfiltration technique developed by the PI.  Iron concentrations will be measured by an isotope dilution-high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry microanalytical method.  The thermodynamic stability constants and kinetic rate constants of Fe-complexing natural ligands in the soluble and colloidal phases will be determined by the competitive ligand equilibration/cathodic stripping voltammetric method.  The PI also plans to assess the spatial and temporal variability of these parameters at these two sites.  Results from this study will provide useful constraints for models to determine the biological availability of soluble and colloidal Fe, the fate of Fe from dust inputs to the surface ocean and the Fe limitation on nitrogen fixation.<br/><br/>"

This project will explore how they would like to see the Web used to benefit them, what use they can make of online access to the materials, and what kinds of improvements in interfaces and in policy would best suit the communities.  The project involves both design of computer systems and travel and interviewing the communities.  It will result in knowledge that may help ameliorate the ""digital divide"" between the majority US society and the generally poorer Native American communities, as well as presenting challenges to computer science research to learn how to build systems that support the policies needed by these communities."

Measurements of water                column and sediment methane concentrations and carbon isotope ratios            will be made with the intention of determining whether the hydrocarbons         observed are modern, or are related to the presence of petroleum                under the sea.                                                                                                                                                  The northwest shelf of Australia is known to have petroleum potential.          Measurements in this environment will extend the U.S. investigator's            previous experience in Alaskan and Black Sea waters, and the earlier            joint studies of the U.S. and Australian investigators in methane               geochemistry.  This research is aimed at understanding the geochemical          and microbiological controls on anaerobic methane oxidation, and the            role this process plays in the global methane budget, which could               play an important role in atmospheric warming."

The variability of temperature in real volcanic systems exceeds 1000 degrees, crossing the vapor, liquid and solidus phases of the host and volcanic materials.  Thus, large changes in temperature affect changes in the dynamics of volcanic systems.  It is exceedingly difficult to scale such temperature changes in the laboratory, and thus many volcanologists take to the field as their lab to understand the processes that control eruptions.  Until recently, for accurate temperature measurements, researchers were limited to thermocouples, optical pyrometry, or simple spot radiometers, delivering the temperature of a single target.  The forward looking infrared radiometer (FLIR) provides a complete image, with accurate temperatures at every pixel.  This provides a spatial dimension to the data which has been previously unavailable.  This new dimension in the FLIR data provides a framework to link diverse geophysical data sets.  This grant support the acquisition of two handheld FLIR systems by the Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska.  These systems will be used to study heat transfer processes from recent lavas flows at volcanoes worldwide but will primarily  be focused on study of numerous active Aleutian arc volcanoes and the Kilauea hot spot volcano in Hawaii.   The systems will support basic research on radiative transfer and lava dynamics and eruption types, volcanic hazard assessment and graduate student education in volcanology.  The availability of the two FLIR systems, where collaborative efforts allow, can be linked to provide stereo imagery useful to measure erupted gas and lava volumes not possible with a single unit.<br/>***<br/><br/><br/>"

These uncertainties are driven, in large part, by vegetation and ecosystem properties that modulate the effect of climate on permafrost temperatures. Long-term monitoring of permafrost temperatures demonstrates the importance of these local conditions, yet there has been no pan-arctic effort to measure ecological and landscape variables in concert with permafrost temperature monitoring. This project will use a combination of field and remotely-sensed data to address the question of how vegetation and landscape factors modulate permafrost temperature response to climate change. To address this question the researchers will couple an extensive pan-arctic assessment of vegetation-permafrost dynamics with an intensive study of shrub and tree canopy cover effects on ecosystem energy balance. The first component of this research will be conducted at long-term permafrost temperature monitoring sites in Siberia and Alaska, and the second component, the vegetation-energy balance sites that will be established as part of this proposal, will be conducted at a shrub-tree canopy cover gradient in Siberia, where most permafrost regions are located. These intensively studied energy balance sites will provide an improved mechanistic understanding of the effects of ecosystem components, and interactions among these components, on ecosystem energy balance and permafrost vulnerability to climate change. This mechanistic knowledge will, in turn, support interpretation of broad patterns observed through a pan-arctic sampling of the permafrost temperature monitoring sites."

Coupled natural-human systems; improved scenarios of biodiversity; and ecosystem services that integrate the outputs of both direct and indirect drivers such as land use change, invasive alien species, overexploitation, environmental change, pollution, and models of impacts of these drivers on biodiversity and ecosystem service are needed to overcome these challenges. This type of holistic approach provides a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments and environmental co-benefits of biodiversity and ecosystem services. This research builds on such methodology to examine the impact of sea ice loss in the Arctic on ecosystems and ecosystem services in Arctic coastal regions because these nearshore waters are among some of the most productive in the world. Goals of the US part of the project are to examine biodiversity and food web changes resulting from present and future changes in seasonal ice-covered and ice-free Arctic coasts. Field data will be augmented by high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery. Collaborators from other countries will be supported by their associated national funding agencies. Results of the study will be applied to evaluate habitat loss; the impact increased coastal erosion and sediment loads have on changes in nearshore bottom habitats and biodiversity; and the cascading effects of these processes on food webs.  Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration with Norway, Poland, Canada, and Denmark. The project will build bridges between countries and communities with interests in the Arctic; engage stakeholders ranging from local communities to national environmental protection agencies, including indigenous peoples; and develop a far-reaching and rich, public, data resource on Arctic systems impacted by sea ice loss that will be available to natural and social scientists across countries and disciplines. The project also sets a framework for sustainable socio-ecological management of Arctic coasts that could be important for the planning, construction, and sustainability of new infrastructure in the development of mineral, oil, gas, and other resources; the siting of potential new shipping lanes; and assessing/predicting changes in fisheries. Additional impacts of the project include the integration of science and education and training a postdoctoral scholar to become one of the next generation of international scholars.  The project also supports a researcher from a gender underrepresented in the sciences at an institution in an EPSCoR state (i.e., Alaska).<br/><br/>This award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance as well as to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility, and fill gaps in knowledge. Funds support U.S. participants in a large international consortium of Danish, Polish, Canadian, US, and Norwegian scientists who seek to dramatically improve understanding of how the biodiversity of organisms in Arctic nearshore environments are impacted by the loss of sea ice. Participants in this effort from other countries are funded through their associated national funding organizations. Activities of the US scientists include providing food web and other physical measurements required to evaluate the consequences of sea ice loss on biodiversity as northern Arctic coastlines change from seasonal ice-covered to ice-free coasts.  Target species include primary marine producers such as macroalgae, microphytobenthos, phytoplankton, and ice algae.  Species will be analyzed for diversity and food-web connectivity to primary producers in both pelagic and benthic realms. Measurements of the physical and chemical characteristics of habitats will complement and provide context for the biological measures. International collaborators will use remote sensing with high-resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery to generalize results from local sites to be applicable the wider, geographical, pan-Arctic scale. Remotely sensed optical data of chlorophyll a (Chl a); total suspended sediment; colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM); and, where applicable, nearshore vegetation will be used to provide insights into the dynamic, spatial, and temporal variability of key food-web environmental parameters of Arctic coasts under different icing conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to develop the first system model to simulate the full chain of processes that control how weather and climate affect the processes that lead to deposition of a sediment record in lakes in glaciated watersheds. This model provides an alternative approach to previous statistically-based models traditionally used by paleo-climatologists to infer past climate variability from lake sediment records. The new process-based quantitative understanding will lay the groundwork for future studies that will be aimed at recovering records of environmental and climate change that extend back thousands of years. <br/><br/>This project will contribute to ongoing efforts through collaborations with: utility managers of the Municipality of Anchorage who are planning for diminished glacier meltwater input to Eklutna Lake, a major source of their electricity and freshwater and with resource managers at US Fish and Wildlife Service who are developing a monitoring network for the Arctic Refuge and who are striving to foresee future changes in habitat quality associated with glacier retreat. This project will benefit climate science researchers by leading to more accurate climate reconstructions, which will be used as benchmarks for validating global climate model output. Finally, it will support four early-career scientists and will train graduate and undergraduate students in system-science research.<br/><br/>Technical<br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to develop a system model that encodes the major processes that govern the amount and grain size of sediment that accumulates in arctic lakes in glaciated catchments, and to acquire the field-based data for model input and testing. Sediments that accumulate at the bottom of arctic lakes contain a wealth of information about how major features of the surrounding watershed have varied on seasonal to millennial time scales, as well as how they have responded to natural and anthropogenic forcings. Lakes in glaciated watersheds record changes in the melt rate of upstream glaciers, which are among the most dynamic components of the evolving arctic system. The sediment stored in glacier-fed lakes often comprise distinct rhythmic layers that represent annual cycles. These varved sediments are among the most valuable of all natural archives on Earth because they can be placed on a precise time line, and because they accumulate at a rate that is sufficiently high to track environmental variability on annual, and often seasonal, scales. They have been used extensively to reconstruct past climate changes in the Arctic, most often relying on statistical correlations between records from long-term weather stations and varve thickness. These statistical correlations disregard the complex and time-evolving interactions within the glacier-hydrology-lake-sedimentation system that link climate to changing properties of sediment deposited at the lake bottom. A more process-based understanding of the interactions that control sedimentation within lakes of glaciated catchments is needed to provide the next generation of paleoclimate reconstructions. By incorporating a system-modeling approach, a process-based system model will be developed to capture dynamic nonlinearities in the glacier-hydrology-lake-sedimentation system. The system model will couple three existing model components: a physically based, spatially explicit hydrological model, which includes a glacier sub-model; an empirically based sediment-flux model; and a process-response, basin-filling sedimentation model. The system model will be applied to three glaciated watersheds that fall along an environmental gradient spanning from the sub-Arctic to the High Arctic, including Lake Linne (Svalbard), Lake Peters (near McCall Glacier, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge), and Eklutna Lake (near Anchorage, Alaska). This study builds on extensive previous and on-going process studies at or near each of the study sites. Existing data and proposed glacier, hydrology, limnology, and sediment process studies will provide the input data to run the system model and to validate its output."

Permafrost nitrogen release has the potential to stabilize the response of the carbon cycle to climate warming because it is a negative, within-system feedback. It could confer resilience to ecosystem-atmosphere interactions in a warming Arctic. The research under this award will advance understanding of the arctic system by incorporating this feedback into a terrestrial biosphere model used extensively by the community for forecasting arctic environmental change and its links to the Earth system.<br/><br/>The collaborative nature of the project will build partnerships between ecosystem ecologists and molecular biologists, creating new knowledge about the role of plant-fungal mutualisms in Earth system feedback cycles. The project will support career development of two female arctic scientists at the postdoctoral or new faculty level. It will contribute to the training of two graduate students in biogeosciences, ecology, and molecular biology, and provide an authentic field or laboratory research experience for about twenty undergraduate students. The project will contribute to broadening participation of under-represented groups in ecological and environmental sciences.<br/><br/>Technical<br/><br/>About 1,700 Pg of organic carbon (C) reside in the permafrost soils and sediments of Arctic and Boreal regions. Because this stock is more than twice the size of the atmospheric C pool, there is considerable interest in understanding how the C balance of permafrost ecosystems will respond to observed and predicted climate warming. As permafrost soils thaw, organic matter that has been cryogenically protected for hundreds to thousands of years is exposed to microbial decomposition and released to the atmosphere as greenhouse gases. One key factor that may strongly influence C balance in these ecosystems is the concurrent release of nitrogen (N), the element most likely to limit plant productivity. Release of N at or after thaw could increase plant N availability, stimulate plant C uptake and offset or balance permafrost C emissions. Although scientists acknowledge the key role N is likely to play in the permafrost C feedback to climate, there have been few empirical studies of the factors that control its fate in warming permafrost ecosystems. The objective of this project is to develop a mechanistic understanding of the role of permafrost N in the C balance of Alaskan tundra landscapes underlain by permafrost soils.<br/><br/>The project will focus on plant acquisition of permafrost N because in most N-limited terrestrial ecosystems, plant uptake is the dominant fate of N released by microbial processes. Plants depend on fungal partners to access N beyond the reach of roots, so this research will also focus on plant mycorrhizal status and fungal community composition to elucidate the role fungal symbionts play in plant N acquisition. Finally, other fates of permafrost N will be explored, including stasis and loss. Proposed research will explore three general questions: What is the potential for release of plant-available nitrogen from thawing permafrost soil organic matter; what proportion of N released deep in the soil profile, at the base of the active layer, is acquired by mycorrhizae and plants and what are the key biotic and abiotic factors that control acquisition; and how will permafrost thaw and N release affect net ecosystem carbon balance and net biogeochemical radiative forcing from permafrost thaw at local and regional scales?<br/><br/>The research approach includes three elements: observations of plants, fungi and soils across a regional survey of upland tundra ecological landscape units on the North Slope of the Brooks Range, Alaska; occupying intensive research sites in cold and warm moist acidic tundra, where measurements of mycorrhizal fungi and plant N acquisition and N loss will be made within long-term warming experiments and well-characterized natural thaw gradients; and modeling and regional integration with a terrestrial biosphere model specifically developed to simulate C and N dynamics in high latitude systems."

Most of these lakes are termed ""thermokarst"" because they form in ice-rich permafrost and gradually expand over time. The dynamic nature of thermokarst lakes also makes them prone to catastrophic drainage and abrupt conversion to wetlands, called drained thermokarst lake basins (DTLBs). Together, thermokarst lakes and DTLBs cover up to 80% of arctic lowland regions, making understanding their response to ongoing climate change essential for coastal plain environmental assessment. Catastrophic lake drainage and subsequent ecosystem succession in DTLBs has long intrigued scientists concerned with permafrost, vegetation, and carbon storage. Less attention however has been devoted toward predicting where and when lakes will drain and the magnitude and impacts of downstream flooding. A related process, snow-dam outburst floods from existing DTLBs, has also been overlooked so far in arctic hydrology. Floods generated from snow-dam outburst may help explain abnormally large flood peaks in many arctic rivers and will be increasingly important to consider for future petroleum development and the need to expand roads and pipeline through coastal plain terrain. This research on catastrophic lake drainage is relevant to improving our understanding of permafrost and hydrological processes; identifying flood and ground stability hazards; and predicting future vegetation, terrestrial and aquatic habitat, and carbon storage dynamics.<br/><br/>A combination of remote sensing, field observations, and a lake-drainage experiment are targeted at understanding the causes and consequences of DTLB formation and their broader feedbacks with other arctic system components. Data collected in this study will feed into future model development to enhance predictive capacity of hydrologic hazards and landscape responses to climate change in the Arctic. Space-for-time comparison of DTLB chronosequences provides the conceptual framework for linking process scales. The new conceptual model emerging from this project is important for a number of stakeholders and native villages, where water access, habitat mitigation, and hazard avoidance are a priority. The understanding of hazards and environmental processes gained from this research will advance the interests of industry, land managers, and subsistence users on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

SuperDARN is an international network of high frequency radars that measure the motion of ionized plasma in Earth's ionosphere.  At high latitudes, the plasma motion is indicative of coupling processes between the solar wind, the magnetosphere, and the upper atmosphere.  Operational tasks for the SuperDARN site at Kodiak include periodic maintenance visits to the site, software maintenance, development of control programs, updating the operating schedule, and monitoring the status of data transfers from the radar to the SuperDARN archive, maintenance of local computer systems to host the data, and support of users in the use and interpretation of the data. The research plan includes substorm studies, auroral electric fields, irregularity generation, neutral wind forcing by the ionospheric plasma, investigation of hemispheric conjugate phenomena, convection dynamics, and convection modeling. The study addresses some of the fundamental problems of space physics, and continued operation of the SuperDARN network advances understanding of the Earth's upper atmosphere, ionosphere, and magnetosphere, and the impact of solar disturbances on the Earth's plasma environment. Broader impacts include the maintenance of scientific infrastructure for the benefit of the scientific community. SuperDARN is widely used in the space physics and aeronomy community and each radar plays an essential role. Because it is an international network, SuperDARN fosters collaboration among member nations. There are currently at least ten nations that support SuperDARN work. It plays an important role in the space physics research programs in each of these nations. The cooperative scientific effort fostered under this program will also contribute to the education of the next generation of scientists."

This warming has triggered large changes in the number and size of wildfires, the melting of frozen soil, patterns of water flow, and outbreaks of insects and diseases. Thus, Alaskan landscapes are changing rapidly in complex ways, which is important because the changes directly affect the availability of natural resources and ecosystem services to Alaskan residents. More generally, changes to landscapes in the far North are of global significance because boreal forests cover vast areas and play a role in determining the Earth's climate. Understanding how and why boreal forests respond as they do to a warmer world is important for predicting both regional and global changes over the next century. This Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) project, started in 1987, will continue to provide long-term data on how changing climate impacts Alaskan forests and the people who depend on them for a living.  This LTER research will test new ideas and gain fresh insights of the type possible only from studies that last decades. The LTER scientists will also continue their long history of collaboration with state and federal agencies regarding forest and wildlife management, especially in regard to increasing disturbance from fire. <br/><br/>This project represents an integrated research program to study the cross-scale controls over responses of the Alaskan boreal forest to changing climate-disturbance interactions, including the associated consequences for regional feedbacks to the climate system, and to identify vulnerabilities and potential adaptations to social-ecological change with rural Alaskan communities and land management agencies. The project addresses the dynamics of change through the integration of five components: 1) Studying direct effects of climate change on ecosystems and disturbance regimes by characterizing controls over the spatial heterogeneity of ecosystems and disturbances, and the sensitivities of these controls to regional climate, and by studying the spatial and temporal synchrony of multiple disturbances to assess which landscapes are most vulnerable to change; 2) Understanding patterns, mechanisms, and consequences for scale-dependent climate-disturbance interactions involving current and legacy influences of fire, permafrost, and trophic dynamics as drivers of ecosystem and landscape change; 3) Linking landscape heterogeneity with regional and global climate feedbacks by studying and modeling how intermediate-scale patterns and processes influence regional scale ecosystem dynamics and climate feedbacks; 4) Studying how climate variability and change are affecting coupled social-ecological dynamics by characterizing variability in changes to ecosystem services across a select group of interior Alaskan communities, and collaborating with communities to find solutions that reduce vulnerability and improve adaptation to social-ecological change; 5) Integrating science and resource management with regional environmental change by coordinating research activities with agencies to fill management knowledge gaps, assessing outcomes of policy decisions, and communicating syntheses to policy makers in meaningful ways."

Three August-September cruises, one every two years, will be conducted, with extensive measurements along continental margins, a boundary current conduit; cruises will cover vast areas from Svalbard to the East Siberian Sea. The program ties together oceanographic, chemical, and ice observations using moorings, repeated oceanographic sections, and Lagrangian drifters to provide vital information about Arctic Ocean changes.  The overarching goal of the study as an AON element is to compile a cohesive picture of the state and transformations of Atlantic Water (AW) in the EMB, with particular focus on three major observational targets: (1) along-slope AW transport by the boundary currents (2) interaction of AW branches with shelf waters, deep basin interior and upper ocean (3) EMB indications of changes in the upper ocean circulation. The proposed targets are broad in scope and pose a wide range of challenges to modern high-latitude observational oceanography.  The EMB's size and location mean that this part of the Arctic Ocean is representative of pan-arctic conditions and processes, and therefore appropriate for long-term observing. Therefore, the project is an important element of the pan-AON.  Graduate students will be supported; female and Alaska Native students will be encouraged to participate. Program outreach will culminate in 2013 with a shipboard summer school. Data and products, critically-needed benchmarks for Arctic satellite sea-ice and altimeter measurements, will be available per AON data policy."

The fundamental issue to be addressed is solar control of irregularity production via indirect IMF effects versus direct effects of solar-induced ionization. This study will focus on evaluating the extent of IMF control of small-scale irregularities and the relationship to other scales. The project will address the question of whether the presence of the polar patches is a necessary condition for irregularity production, and whether solar illumination suppresses or enhances irregularity generation. Inter-hemispheric differences will be investigated to determine the relative importance of solar wind drivers versus solar ionization.<br/><br/>Earlier studies of small-scale plasma irregularities have analyzed local observations using rockets and/or radio techniques. This project will analyze irregularity production in the polar cap in context of its global drivers focusing on observations from the first US Antarctic HF (SuperDARN) radar at McMurdo, Antarctica and complementary instrumentation. The polar cap ionosphere is directly connected to the solar wind; hence, one can expect IMF effects on small-scale irregularity production to be even more pronounced than in the previously studied auroral region. The polar cap also has reasonably uniform solar ionization conditions near solstices and sharp contrasts between seasons, so solar illumination effects can be revealed more clearly. In addition, the polar cap appears to be especially rich in irregularities. <br/><br/>This project will leverage data from the NSF-funded Antarctic facilities, providing essential support for a newly-established faculty researcher in the US, and expand a graduate student training program in the geosciences area in Alaska."

NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, and integrates the co-production of knowledge. This award fulfills part of that aim. <br/><br/>Temperatures in the Arctic are rising rapidly, and these warmer temperatures have caused permafrost, ground that remains frozen for at least two consecutive years, to warm and thaw. Permafrost coasts, which make up approximately 30% of the world's coastlines, are experiencing accelerated erosion due to thawing. Erosion at some locations has occurred at the rate of 16 m per year since 2007. Degradation of permafrost and related coastal erosion damages coastal infrastructure and facilities across the Arctic, impacting the economic prosperity and lives of its inhabitants. As critical infrastructure becomes vulnerable to permafrost degradation and erosion, residents are forced to abandon homes and entire communities must be relocated. This diverts resources from other critical needs and disrupts social networks and subsistence practices. This research addresses society's capacity to adapt by analyzing interactions among the natural environment, social systems, and the built environment, in a part of the Arctic where coastal erosion due to permafrost degradation is taking place. This project co-produces knowledge with Arctic indigenous communities and will share research outcomes to inform decision-making with local communities and the public. The project promotes NSF's initiative of Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (INCLUDES) by involving local indigenous high school students in the collection of field data, providing workshops in local communities demonstrating how science and engineering can improve community well-being, and provides students and early-career researchers with training and capacity-building opportunities in convergent research. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the complex relationship between permafrost degradation and related coastal erosion, civil infrastructure, and community well-being, including social and cultural resilience. Results can be used to formulate a holistic and predictive model that aids adaptation of social systems and the built environment to the unprecedented environmental changes in the region. The project consists of five research tasks with related research products: (1) development of a thermal model with high spatial resolution (130 m) to evaluate and predict the rate, extent, and mechanisms of permafrost degradation in the next century and a maximum entropy principle model to estimate the future rate of coastal and river bluff erosion and thermokarst development; (2) creation of an infrastructure hazards map of the region experiencing the effects of permafrost degradation and coastal erosion; (3) co-production of knowledge with Arctic indigenous communities to identify and understand the most urgent issues relating to permafrost degradation and coastal erosion and flooding, as well as collecting and integrating local long-term observations of these phenomena by local observers; (4) development of a quantitative assessment model of sociodemographic resilience of communities to permafrost degradation, demonstrating the impacts of infrastructure disruptions on the social resilience and adaptation capacity of coastal communities; and (5) development of an agent-based model (ABM) that can be used to adapt civil infrastructure and build the social resilience of communities to future permafrost degradation and coastal erosion. The project works with communities along the coastal region of Alaska North Slope Borough (NSB) to develop and validate models, although results will be of value to many coastal communities experiencing permafrost-induced coastal erosion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Northern Dene provides one of the best remaining opportunities in North America to document and describe an Indigenous astronomy system. However, the proposed research is particularly time sensitive as recent rapid language shift combined with modern technology has replaced nearly every aspect in which astronomy was traditionally utilized, leading to the disuse and erosion of traditional astronomy knowledge systems. Documentation of Northern Dene astronomy provides a baseline for comparison of Indigenous astronomical knowledge across cultures, and is thus fundamental to understanding Dene conceptualization of the cosmos. Dene astronomy also provides insights into broader aspects of culture, life-way, and cosmology; hence, this research will be useful by scholars in related disciplines, including linguistics, cognition, geography, and astronomy. Astronomy also arouses natural curiosity among Northern Dene communities and the broader public, and thus can be readily integrated in school curricula and education outreach programs.<br/><br/>Paragraph 2<br/>This project supports dissertation research with Northern Dene collaborators in order to better understand Indigenous concepts of astronomy. Although astronomy is a fundamental component of all Dene cultures, there has so far been no systematic effort to document Dene knowledge of the sky. Rapid change in traditional land use has led to this astronomical knowledge being even more endangered than the Indigenous languages themselves. This study builds on initial research with the Alaskan Gwich'in to include additional ethnolinguistic groups within the Northern Dene region. Field work will be conducted in several communities in Alaska and Canada, working with Northern Dene tradition bearers who have specialized astronomy knowledge. This study will provide much needed baseline documentation on Northern Dene knowledge of the sky, while also seeking to understand how celestial objects and atmospheric phenomena are utilized by the Northern Dene in cultural contexts, such as in navigation, time-reckoning, weather forecasting, and cosmology. Specific areas of inquiry related to the uses of Dene astronomy include: knowledge about stars and constellations, the northern lights, meteors, comets, atmospheric halos and sun dogs (parhelia), the sun and moon. All research will be conducted collaboratively with community members. The results of the research will be incorporated into ongoing community school curricula development and public planetarium programming.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Local winds in the 150-250 km range are very difficult to measure owing to the absence of sustained optical emissions over this altitude range. The PI therefore proposes to artificially stimulate such emissions by directly heating the ionosphere using very high-power, high-frequency radio waves. These emissions will be detected by an  instrument called a Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI), that characterizes the properties of light emitted by molecules in motion. The heating of the ionosphere will take place at the High frequency Active Auroral Radar Project (HAARP) facility in Alaska. Two FPIs will be located within 320 km from the HAARP facility, in order to resolve the horizontal wind vector. Broader impacts of this proposal include Ph.D. training at UAF, STEM outreach to local schools, and raising the profile of the HAARP heating facility following its transition from military to UAF management.<br/><br/>The specific goals of this project are to 1. Determine winds with high vertical (10 km) and temporal (several minutes) resolution through coordinated FPI and HAARP observing activity 2.

The intellectual merits of the proposal lie in demonstrating the new wind recovery methods, and in resolving their altitudinal and temporal variability."

While many plants respond to warmer springs by flowering earlier, a significant number of species do not respond, and some even show delayed flowering. Such patterns are inconsistent with predictions based on well-understood physiological responses to temperature.  For plants that grow in boreal forest, however, the process that ends in the bursting of flower buds actually begins a year or more before flowers open, a developmental process known as ""preformation"". This research will test the hypothesis that the effects of rising temperatures on the extended period of preformation explain delayed flowering.  The effects of rising temperatures on preformation may limit the extent to which plants can adapt to environmental variability. The discovery of a strong role for development could dramatically improve our ability to predict the timing of flowering in high-latitude communities and may also provide insights into how temperate trees and shrubs, the majority of which preform flowers, will respond to increasing temperatures. This project will also involve citizen scientists, who will obtain phenology, temperature and snow depth data from across Alaska.<br/><br/>This project will evaluate three potential effects of warm temperatures on the development of flower primordia: increasing temperatures could 1) induce early bud set and dormancy; 2) induce more rapid development and / or a delay in bud set so that some buds mature in the fall of the year in which they were initiated; and 3) delay flower initiation. Eight species of understory boreal shrubs will be studied; their small stature makes them amenable to experimental temperature manipulation, and because they are woody they likely share features of preformation with the dominant trees and shrubs of diverse plant communities. Open-topped chambers will be used to raise temperatures for one or two growing seasons, and development will be followed over the course of three years. Temperature will be related to potential developmental determinants of flower opening: timing of initiation, rate of development, and cessation of growth. By manipulating and analyzing the effects of time of snow melt, date of growth initiation and temperature across the entire multi-year trajectory of flower development for representative species, the researchers will identify the mechanisms that underlie ""non-typical"" phenological responses."

It is well established that linear depolarization measurements offer unique capabilities to detect and classify the nature of clouds and aerosols, and a variety of such data will be obtained using an improved two-channel mobile lidar system. Such lidars unambiguously separate spherical from nonspherical particles, and further are sensitive to the exact shape of irregular particles. The lidar system will be evaluated in the field by sampling known aerosol types in Alaska such as transported Asian desert dust, Arctic haze, ice fog, tree pollens, forest fire smoke,internal combustion engine by-products, and sea spray.

At the same time, human development continues to encroach and intensify, primarily due to demand for natural resources, such as oil and gas. The vast and remote nature of Arctic-boreal regions typify their landscapes, environment, wildlife, and people, but their size and isolation also make it difficult to study how their ecosystems are changing. To overcome these challenges, autonomous recording networks can be used to characterize ""soundscapes"" - a collection of sounds that emanate from landscapes. Unlike traditional observing methods that are expensive, labor-intensive, and logistically challenging, sound-recording networks provide a cost-effective means to both monitor and understand the response of wildlife to environmental and anthropogenic changes across vast areas. One particular challenge with this sound-measurement approach is extracting useful ecological information from the large volumes of soundscape data that are collected. This project will develop the techniques necessary to overcome this challenge.<br/><br/>The researchers' goal is to understand the influence of both environmental dynamics and increasing anthropogenic activity on the behavior and phenology of migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus), waterfowl, and songbird communities in Arctic-boreal Alaska and northwestern Canada. Through co-production of knowledge with local land managers and indigenous communities, the research team will combine field observations, modeling, and analyses that include: (1) soundscape measurements, (2) camera-trap observations, (3) automated soundscape analyses, (4) analyses of camera-trap caribou observations, (5) high-resolution modeling of environmental variables, (6) statistical analyses including wildlife occupancy, diversity, and phenology modeling, and (7) a human-computation game to collect descriptions of our acoustic recordings that allows for the participation of local and Indigenous players of the game. The project will contribute understanding of how both avian communities and caribou populations are responding to spatiotemporal variations in environmental conditions and increasing development of the oil and gas industry in a region where such comprehensive, large-scale research has rarely been possible. Further, at the request of various Tribal organizations, our research will provide insight into how industrial noise influences traditional practices. In addition, our research will provide baseline data on all natural sounds, including data on bird and caribou activity, in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge prior to oil and gas development. These datasets will be available to inform Indigenous practices and natural resource management, as well as facilitate future Environmental Assessments required by land managers and oil and gas developers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet little is known about the ancient history of the Bering Sea, with no baseline from which to measure any modern changes. This collaborative project will undertake excavations at precisely identified locations in temporally distinct middens at the Hot Springs site, Port Moller, Alaskan Peninsula. Hot Springs has been excavated repeatedly in the past but poorly documented. It is one of the largest, if not the largest, village site on the Bering Sea coast, the northernmost known Aleut village, and a potential place for Aleut/Alutiiq interaction or occupation.  On these grounds, alone, it is worth re-investigating to understand better regional prehistory. However, the PIs will also investigate major archaeological and ecological questions in the Bering Sea region, including human use of landscapes, stability and change in subsistence practices, species distribution, long-term climate change, and sea ice regimes.  The project will add much to our understanding of human ecodynamic systems in the southeastern Bering Sea region, as well as including education and training for local Aleut students.<br/><br/>What makes this project most important is that the site was occupied during some of the warmest climatic regimes of the last 5000 years, often during time periods when the rest of the Alaska Peninsula shows a sparse population.  It is at the southern edge of the winter ice pack but has deep and stratified shellfish deposits from 4000 years of human harvesting. Over 100 taxa of mammals, birds, fish, and shellfish have been identified in the Hot Springs deposits. Using systematic and targeted excavations to collect large samples of faunal remains from the Hot Springs Village site, the PIs will reconstruct the environmental history of the southern Bering Sea  with the potential to create a baseline for modern fisheries studies."

After organisms die, some portion of this carbon sinks into the deep sea where it dissolves back into the water or lands on the seafloor. The Biological Carbon Pump is the name for this carbon transfer out of the sunlit surface ocean, and it is a very important process controlling the earth's carbon cycle and climate. Surprisingly, the size and rate of this transfer remains unclear because data for carbon in particles are not available for many times and places in the ocean. The researcher for this project plans to collect a remarkable new data set and examine it to answer major questions about the Biological Carbon Pump. The data will come from joining existing cruises on research ships sailing through all of the world's oceans, creating a systematic global survey of particles in the ocean. These data will be the heart of a new public database for use by other international researchers in their continued study of the Biological Carbon Pump. For this young researcher, the project will also lay the foundation for a career of integrated research, education, and outreach in oceanography. An Alaskan native will go to sea and analyze data, using these results to complete a Ph.D. degree. In addition, the project will design and produce a new aquarium exhibit at the Alaska SeaLife Center (ASLC) to educate the public about the complex workings and global importance of the Biological Carbon Pump.  These activities should increase diversity in oceanography and inspire a new generation of scientists. <br/><br/>Reliable and useful data on the Biological Carbon Pump is sparse, mostly due to the experimental, logistical, and technical challenges of studying a complex system over the great expanse of the global ocean. This project aims to tackle a fundamental and ongoing problem in studying the Biological Carbon Pump by providing a global and consistent dataset on particles and plankton in the ocean. In collaboration with the US Repeat Hydrography program, this project will use in situ imaging technology to determine the total abundance, size distribution, and functional groups of particles and mesozooplankton along seven global ocean transects. The design will test fundamental hypotheses related to the presence and nature of regional particle hotspots and examine the global patterns of zooplankton activity and vertical migration as they affect the biological pump. Links between satellite data, calculated flux patterns, attenuation of particles through the mesopelagic, and constraints on biogeochemical models will also be investigated."

Direct observations in the Pacific Arctic region, including the northern Bering and Chukchi seas, are needed to understand how this ecosystem is shifting in a time of rapid change. To that end, the investigators will participate in a research expedition scheduled for summer 2020 and will make simultaneous oceanographic measurements of dissolved oxygen, dissolved carbon dioxide, dissolved nutrients, particulate organic matter distribution and composition, and plankton productivity. In addition to providing new information about biological and physical processes in the region, these observations will complement and extend a companion project conducted by collaborators from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution about the distribution and activity of harmful algal bloom species in the region, which are an emergent concern for Alaskan communities. This study will support graduate and undergraduate students, providing them research and experiential educational opportunities. The investigators will attend regional meetings and seminars in Alaska to communicate their findings to broader audiences.<br/><br/>To test hypotheses related to the controls and spatial-temporal patterns in elemental cycling and productivity of the Pacific Arctic, the investigators will measure a novel suite of ecosystem-relevant tracers, sampled at high frequency from the US Coast Guard Cutter Healy's underway system and from CTD surveys. They will make simultaneous, high resolution measurements of dissolved nitrate and phosphorous to evaluate nutrient dynamics, oxygen-argon ratios and partial pressure of carbon dioxide to determine net community production and biologically-mediated air-sea carbon dioxide exchange, and particulate organic matter concentrations and particle-optical properties (particle size, beam attenuation and chlorophyll fluorescence) to quantify trends in phytoplankton biomass and size structure. In addition, the investigators will use the triple oxygen isotope technique and carbon-13/nitrogen-15 uptake incubations to determine rates of primary productivity, as well as Fast Repetition Rate Fluorometry to evaluate phytoplankton nutritional status under variable environmental conditions. This multi-tracer approach will discriminate different processes (e.g., advection, upwelling and mixing) and their biogeochemical/ecological response (e.g., productivity, respiration, export, and shifts in community composition) at fine temporal and spatial scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Observations of surface and free tropospheric ozone in the northern hemisphere show a spring maximum. Previous measurements in Alaska and model simulations indicate that some of this peak can be explained by photochemical production from winter accumulated, anthropogenic, ozone precursors. In this regard, the most important ozone precursor is peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN). Measurements also show an important role for vertical transport in warming of air masses and causing thermal decomposition of PAN in the boundary layer. This anthropogenically caused ozone production may contribute to the long-term increases in ozone which have been observed at several northern hemispheric locations during spring and summer.    In this project, ground-based measurements of ozone, nitrogen oxides, total reactive nitrogen, PAN, carbon monoxide, radiation, radon, and reactive radical species, as well as aerosol properties, ultraviolet radiation, and meteorological parameters will be measured by the PI in collaboration with other researchers at the Cheeka Peak research site in Washington. In addition, aircraft-borne measurements of the abundance of ozone, nitric oxide, PAN, and carbon monoxide will be performed in the spring of 1997 in conjunction with the ground-based measurements. 0- and 1-dimensional models will be employed. The data will provide answers to questions including: (1) What is the ozone budget in this region; (2) What are the conditions that give rise to air mass warming and PAN composition, leading to enhanced ozone formation; (3) What is the influence of Asian emissions on air masses which arrive at the West Coast of the US; and (4) What is the influence of cloud types and heights on the ozone/nitrogen oxide photochemistry."

Warming of peatlands, therefore, has high potential to create strong feedbacks to global climate if it causes accelerated rates of decomposition that result in the release of this carbon to the atmosphere. Our current view of carbon cycling in peatlands suggests that the majority of decomposition occurs in the thin, oxygen-rich peat layer above the water table.  Once carbon is transferred to deeper, saturated peat layers, decomposition rates of carbon are thought to be negligible due to cold temperatures and low-oxygen conditions that inhibit decomposition.  Peat soil carbon below the water table can, however, be decomposed by microbes using a variety of biochemical processes that don't rely on free oxygen, but are energetically less efficient. These alternative metabolic pathways can result in the production of methane (CH4), a trace gas with much higher greenhouse warming potential than carbon dioxide (CO2).  Thus, the position of the water table has traditionally been used as a predictor of overall decomposition rates and methane production in peatlands.  However, preliminary results from an Alaskan peatland water-table manipulation experiment (the Alaska Peatland Experiment, or APEX) suggest that decomposition and resulting CO2 production may be higher in deeper peat layers than previously thought. The goals of this research are to investigate the factors driving decomposition of carbon in deep peat layers, and to use this information to benefit society by improving future projections of the impact of peatlands on global climate. This study will also provide valuable opportunities for the training of undergraduate and graduate students, and to educate school children on the drivers and impacts of climate change through collaboration with the Schoolyard LTER program.  <br/><br/>Over the past 8 years, research on APEX has examined the role of changing soil climate and vegetation on peatland carbon cycling through monitoring changes in soil moisture and temperature, plant composition and biomass, and ecosystem CO2 and CH4 fluxes. The experiment includes a factorial design of water table treatments (including lowering the water table to simulate drying, and raising the water table to simulate flooding) and surface soil warming in an Alaskan fen.  This research has revealed gaps in our understanding of microbial decomposition processes in peatlands, and provides the context for the hypotheses being tested in this project.  In particular, previous work suggests different plant functional types interact with water table in determining aerobic and anaerobic peat decomposition.  In addition, variation in litter chemistry between plant functional types is hypothesized to be a major driver of decomposition rates in peatlands. Collectively, these factors suggest that changes in vegetation exert significant control over anaerobic decomposition processes in peatlands, but to date these effects have not been studied adequately, in part because it is difficult methodologically to separate vegetation from hydrologic controls on decomposition. New experiments being conducted in this project are designed to provide mechanistic insights into a suite of factors, including the role of vegetation, that control stabilization of peatland carbon."

The densest geodetic and seismic networks in Japan made this earthquake the best-recorded event ever. Seafloor geodetic stations recorded over 10s of m horizontal displacements during the earthquake. High-resolution seismic bathymetry data indicate that the rupture reached the trench. Model inversion studies indicate a slip distribution of up to ~50 m over a remarkable compact area of 400 km along strike and 200 km wide. Coseismic and postseismic crustal deformation recorded at unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution and precision allow the researchers to further their understanding of the rheological structure of the Earth and the subduction zone processes. In particular, the high quality geodetic data provide a unique opportunity to constrain the three-dimensional (3D) rheology of the upper mantle and lower crust and the evolution of transient slip on the megathrust. The scope of the project will be broad enough such that results will be applicable to other subduction margins (Sumatra, Chile, Alaska and Cascadia) where deformation is currently at various stages of the subduction earthquake cycle.<br/><br/>This project will examine the postseismic deformation of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. In previous investigations, it has been a challenge to separate the contributions of afterslip on the megathrust from viscoelastic relaxation of the earthquake-induced stresses in the upper mantle. Effects of the complex 3D rheology of convergent margins on subduction zone earthquake deformation have yet to be better understood. In the proposed research, we seek to understand: (a) What is the distribution and evolution of the afterslip on the megathrust following a giant earthquake? (b) How does the 3D rheology of the Earth control the postseismic crustal deformation? (c) What are the rheological properties of the oceanic and continental upper mantle? In this work the researchers will benefit from access to the wealth of Global Positioning System (GPS) data recorded by the Japan national network as well as regional stations across East Asia. They will also constrain afterslip using repeating earthquakes. A 3D finite element code will incorporate complex subduction slab geometry and advanced mantle rheology in the Earth."

It investigates patterns of body temperature change and the phenology of hibernation in a natural population of arctic ground squirrels in Northern Alaska and tests hypotheses about the effect of diet and burrow choice for individual survivorship and reproduction. This project will test the diet hypotheses, in collaboration with Dr. C. L. Frank, which revolves around the role of plant-derived essential fatty acids in constraining hibernation physiology. Laboratory-based experiments will be conducted that quantify the metabolic costs of hibernating under arctic temperature conditions and investigate the fundamental basis for what limits how long mammals can stay hypothermic and hypometabolic during hibernation. The fieldwork continues a long-term physiological monitoring program of this arctic mammal population. <br/><br/>The project will focus on the following specific goals:  (1a) Using automated sensing, describe the timing of immergence into and emergence from hibernation, natural limits to supercooling during torpor, pattern and duration of periodic arousals, and how sex, reproductive, and age cohorts of arctic ground squirrels differ in hibernation patterns and phenology. (1b) Measure annual soil temperature profiles at each individual's hibernaculum. Pilot data show that minimum hibernacula temperatures vary from -7 to - 25 0C determine the sources of this variation (surface and soil physical and climatological features) and the extent of spatial (among-burrow) and temporal (among-year) variation. Manipulate physical factors such as vegetation and snow cover over burrows by altering snowdrift and determine the thermal consequences for the hibernaculum and its occupant. (2) Correlate variation in overwinter survivorship or change in body condition in surviving individuals with thermal features of their hibernacula. Because they expend more energy maintaining larger thermal gradients between body and soil, ground squirrels occupying colder burrows should suffer more mortality or lose more body stores during hibernation than do animals occupying warmer burrows. These experiments investigate the effect of the winter physical environment and its spatial and temporal variation on fat and lean loss and survivorship and, since spring fecundity is affected by overwinter body mass loss, reproductive fitness of a key arctic mammalian species. (3) Test the effect of dietary lipids and polyunsaturated level of adipose tissue on the pattern and depth of hibernation and overwinter survivorship of individuals. The concentration of essential fatty acids obtained from arctic plants during fattening in arctic ground squirrels will be determined from a biopsy of depot fat taken when data loggers are implanted, and dietary lipids will be manipulated in captive animals. (4) Results from sampling<br/>animals as they enter and emerge from hibernation in successive years will add to our long-term data set on the physiological ecology, chronology, endocrinology, and life-history characteristics of this arctic population of ground squirrels. Set in the context of the other long-term ecological and physiological research done at the Toolik Field Station, these experiments can integrate the role of a key mammalian herbivore into the systems approach of study of this arctic community. The following laboratory experiments quantify the energetic costs of hibernation in arctic conditions and investigate the nature of limits to how long a mammal can stay in hibernation.  (5) Determine steady-state metabolic rate, metabolic fuel use, and sources of thermogenesis in arctic ground squirrels hibernating at ambient temperatures of -20 to +20 0C. (6) Measure maximum torpor bout length (TBL) of animals hibernating in conditions of -20 to +20 0C and monitored for body and brain temperature. Maximum TBL should inversely reflect the rate by which an unknown process(es) deviates from homeostatic levels during hibernation.  Since body temperature and metabolic rate become uncoupled in arctic ground squirrels hibernating over this temperature range, we can investigate the nature of this process, which may represent a fundamental constraint to continued homeostasis during hypothermia and hypometabolism in mammals. <br/>***<br/><br/>"

Recently, scientific interest in rock glaciers has dramatically increased due to the geotechnical problems and natural hazards they pose, their potential for archiving past and present geologic conditions in alpine environments, their significance in the hydrologic cycle, and their role as a debris transport mechanism.  Knowledge of rock glaciers' internal composition and rheology is important for addressing these topics.  Our understanding of internal structures of rock glaciers is often speculative because rock glaciers are difficult to inspect internally.  This is a unique opportunity to document the internal composition and structure in a complete transverse cross-section through the Fireweed Rock Glacier, Wrangell Mountains, Alaska because the entire snout was recently catastrophically calved.  This rock glacier consists of a debris-covered m(lange.  The ice matrix, which accounts for about one-half of the ice-rock, displays prominent flow signatures.  The Fireweed Rock Glacier is also unique in that it has a high flow rate.    The Principal Investigator will take advantage of this unique opportunity to investigate the structure and flow mechanics of the Fireweed Rock Glacier.  The first objective will be to perform a complete geophysical survey of the glacier.  Geophysical techniques will be calibrated using known geometry and structure at the exposed terminus section, and then extend up glacier to provide a detailed picture of the internal structure and geometry.  The second objective will be to develop a numerical model of rock glacier flow by analyzing velocity measurements and the geometry determined by the geophysical survey.  The results should significantly improve the application of geophysical survey techniques to rock glaciers and mountain permafrost and lead to a better understanding of the rheological laws for the ice-rock mixtures that compose rock glaciers and frozen ground."

This area is one of the largest glaciated regions in the world outside the polar regions, but only five to six glaciers out of thousands have been regularly monitored and have long-term records.   These balances will be determined by repeating the baseline elevation profiles on the glaciers.  The mass balances will be examined in terms of the contribution of the glaciers to sea level rise to determine regional trends in climate change and any possible temporal trends.  Historically, mass balances of glaciers and ice sheets are very difficult to measure.  This difficulty is particularly true for mountain glaciers because of the complex mountain barriers and the wide variety of climate regimes.  Furthermore,  satellite rader altimetry has not been used to successfully measure the mass balance of these glaciers because of their large and irregular surface slopes and relatively small areas.  An important objective of this project will be to determine the applicability and accuracy of airborne profiling to measure the annual mass balances by making repeated profiles on selected glaciers over the four years of this project.   <br/><br/>"

Glaciers are among the most effective agents of erosion. There are indications that glacier basal motion is directly (maybe linearly) related to erosion rates. Yet, basal motion is difficult to assess, in models as well as from observations. A recent deployment of seismometers near the Bering Glacier, Alaska, is offering an unprecedented opportunity to monitor basal processes with modern broadband seismology. Data from these seismometers is being used to look for events of glacial origin, and in particular basal sources. These data are supplemented by five glacier stations of continuously recording GPS and an in-ice seismometer. The GPS are recording an ice velocity timeseries in 3-d that will be correlated with the seismic records. <br/>The GPS are laid out in an array just below the equilibrium line on the main trunk of the Bering Glacier where it drains from the Bagley Ice Valley. The in-ice seismometer is co-located with the GPS station at the center of the GPS array. This sensor is frozen into the surface of the glacier, in a borehole several meters deep, made using a steam drill. With the GPS laid out in an array, the experiment is designed to detect whether discrete slip patches, whole bed sliding events, or increasing ice-bed stresses due to the growth of basal cavities lead to glacial seismic events. Each of these mechanisms may contribute to different mechanisms of erosion at the base. Moreover, the combined seismic and ice velocity data may allow observation of glacial quarrying. Broadband seismometers also allow some determination of the role of fluids at the bed, possibly manifest as harmonic tremor. The expected outcome will be a powerful new data record that may be used to derive improved models of basal motion.<br/>The seismic data come from the summer 2005 deployment of the STEEP (St. Elias Erosion/tectonics Project, funded by Continental Dynamics) seismic array, which has surrounded the Bering Glacier with an IRIS/PASSCAL seismic network. The basic focus of STEEP is to explore the links between erosion and tectonic processes, and the seismic network was built to study tectonics in the St. Elias. By analyzing glacier seismicity within this network, the glacier seismic study is leveraging new results from the seismic data. <br/>Scientifically, the broader impacts of the proposed work are through its direct link to the large multi-disciplinary STEEP activity. The synergies between these projects are large, because an understanding of glacier basal processes is essential. The seismic data establishes a high quality data set that is unprecedented in glaciology and that is enhanced by the GPS data. <br/>This project is funded by Geophysics and the EAR Geomorphology and Land-Use Dynamics Program."

A better understanding of the coupled biological-physical ocean ecosystem, and its interannual variability, is necessary to predict and understand these potential impacts of climate change on the Arctic ecosystem. The Chukchi-Beaufort Sea region near Barrow, AK, including coastal waters, has been identified as key because it lies at the junction of several ocean regions and downstream of the Pacific Arctic gateway and hence is influenced physically and ecologically by input from Bering Strait. Researchers have conducted oceanographic sampling of the coupled physical and biological marine environment in the Chukchi and near-shore Beaufort Seas for five years (2005 ? 2009), including coastal waters, using boat-based surveys during late summer and short-term (month) and year-long bottom-mounted moorings, and have observed significant interannual variability. They will now establish annual surveys of the pelagic marine environment and deploy a year-round mooring in Barrow Canyon as components of the Arctic Observing Network (AON). The surveys will measure a range of biological and physical parameters including hydrography, currents, plankton standing stocks, nutrients, and plankton genetics. The mooring will measure ocean currents, near bottom temperature and salinity, and acoustic backscatter (zooplankton proxy) in Barrow Canyon at a location typically within or beneath the Alaska Coastal Current.<br/><br/>Results from this AON component will provide a 10-year record and enable a better understanding of inter-annual variability in the physical and biological characteristics of the Barrow area ocean confluence.

In the boreal forest, moisture availability in summer affects both tree growth and the fire regime. Summers are brief and seasonal transitions rapid, so even slight shifts in the timing of precipitation patterns can have large impacts. One of the most striking, seasonal phenomena in the Alaskan boreal forest is the onset of frequent frontal storms in late summer. This event usually comes in mid-July but is delayed into August or even September in some years. Summers when the rains are delayed have a greater chance of being mega-fires seasons when >1.6 million ha burn. This project will test the hypothesis that shifts in the seasonality of warm-season precipitation could be a key driver of the boreal forest?s responses to future climate changes. The effect of late-summer precipitation on tree growth and fire in Alaska will be quantified in two ways: First, by analyzing interactions between climate, fire, and tree growth (specifically ring-width, ring density, and wood-isotope composition); second, by analyzing fire-climate relationships using a new statistical approach. Together, these results will improve parameterization of the forest model ALFRESCO, which  will then be used to test additional hypotheses about the interconnections among future climates, tree growth, fire, and their collective feedbacks to the global climate system. <br/><br/>The shifting seasonality of water availability during the warm season may be of key importance in determining how the global boreal forest responds to future climate changes. The multidisciplinary research proposed here represents a new approach to answering a novel question. No one has examined the impacts of seasonal shifts in the timing and magnitude of warm-season precipitation on vegetation distribution, tree growth, and fire regime in the boreal forest before. This will be the first time that tree rings from deciduous species in the boreal forest are used to describe past variations in summer rainfall through measurements of ring-width, late-wood density, and wood isotopes. The generalized boosting technique we propose using has not been previously applied to climate-fire records. The results of these tree-ring and statistical analyses will improve parameterization of the ALFRESCO forest model and allow us to explore the interactions among components of this part of the Arctic system with greater realism.<br/><br/>"

The objective is to explore the nucleation, subsequent growth, and cloud nucleating properties of aerosols to determine the contribution of this source to the ""background"" tropospheric aerosol population. Observations at another location have suggested that, at low tide, there may be substantial new particle production by homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous growth of particles at such a site. This project will explore this possibility and, if such particle production is observed, will establish the basis for a future multidisciplinary project to explore the nucleation process in greater detail. The specific objectives are to determine if there is substantial new-particle production during low tide, and to determine if the bursts show evidence of being correlated with tidal phase, to determine the association of the newly formed particles to sunlight intensity and meteorological conditions, and to measure the growth rates of newly nucleated embryos. The project is also producing a climatological record of the aerosol size distribution for the clean coastal Alaskan environment.<br/><br/>The primary broader impact of this award is likely to be the demonstration of feasibility of a project that has the potential to involve many other investigators and can help improve understanding of aerosol sources in clean regions. These aerosols have widespread effects on cloud properties, radiative transfer in the atmosphere, and heterogeneous chemistry in the atmosphere, so improved understanding of their sources may lead to improvements in the ways they are represented in models of atmospheric processes."

There is negligible sliding at the ice-till interface.  Till has been observed under other glaciers, and in many of them, it may affect their flow pattern. Therefore, it is important to develop a method for studying the flow of thick, active till.  The Principal Investigators will drill to the to the top of the till using a hot-water drill and then drive the probes into the till with a heavy down-hole hammer and receive data without the use of wires.

Results will provide baseline data for examining responses to changing environments; for example, climate change may be contributing to the decline of one species and the expansion of two.

Because of the highly advective nature of the GOA, it is necessary to establish the relative importance of local versus imported production. The PIs will determine the rates of development, growth and egg production for the dominant copepod and euphausiid species in the coastal GOA.  They will determine the in situ rates inshore and offshore by incubation techniques employing artificial cohorts (copepods) and individual females (both copepods and euphausiids). Incubation techniques are the only appropriate methods for this region due to its highly advective nature. The proposed research will put the in situ rates in perspective by determining their maximal rates under food- saturated conditions in the laboratory.  The investigators also will estimate the extent to which secondary production is food-limited in the field by determining the functional relationships of development, growth and egg production to body size, temperature and food regimes. Food regimes will be assessed in terms of chlorophyll and particulate organic carbon, plus the abundance and biomass of autotrophic and heterotrophic protists.

Using these three methods, the project intends to address five major aspects of sea ice:  (1) the changing role of sea ice as an important habitat for microorganisms at the center of Arctic marine foodwebs, (2) the status of the polar bear and other marine mammals heavily depending on sea ice, (3) the role of sea ice as a hazard to shipping and coastal infrastructure, (4) the reduced stability of coastal sea ice as a source of concern to indigenous hunters, (5) sea ice in the context of environmental security, e.g., clean-up of oil spills in ice-covered waters. The project will train a cadre of interdisciplinary researcher to address sea ice issues and leave a legacy for International Polar Year. The project also integrates the sea ice knowledge of Alaska Natives living in Barrow. <br/><br/>"

These images will be constructed by combining data from a sodium lidar and an optical spectrometer obtained during arctic summer months.  The project involves minor modifications to existing instruments at Poker Flat, Alaska, and the development of analysis and calibration software to perform the two-dimensional imaging with high reliability.  The mesopause region hosts persistent layers of neutral and ionized metallic atoms that are replenished by the ablation of meteors.  These metal layers can be used as tracers of the thermal, chemical, and dynamical conditions near the mesopause.  Although the altitude distribution of these layers have been studied using various techniques, the horizontal structure of the layers remains unknown.  This investigation aims to observe the two-dimensional structure of metallic layers using the sun to illuminate sodium atoms, and sensitive instrumentation to detect the scattered sunlight.  The simultaneous lidar measurements will provide information about the altitude distribution of the layers.  Various models have shown that the temperature structure in the mesopause may be a sensitive indicator of global change.  Understanding the distribution of sporadic layers in the mesosphere is important in studying processes that heat and cool the middle atmosphere."

An international network of four Rayleigh lidars located in observatories at Andoya, Norway (69°N, 16°E), Chatanika, Alaska (65°N, 147°W), Kangarlussuaq, Greenland (67°N, 51°W) and Kühlungsborn, Germany (54°N, 12°E) provide a chain of measurements from the eastern Arctic to the western Arctic under distinct synoptic regimes (i.e., the Arctic stratospheric vortex, the Aleutian anticyclone, the stratospheric surf-zone). The lidars will yield high-resolution temperature and density measurements that allow characterization of the planetary waves, tides, and gravity waves.  The satellite observations yield synoptic-scale temperature measurements of the mesosphere and upper stratosphere while the meteorological soundings and analyses provide synoptic-scale measurements of the troposphere and lower stratosphere.  We have three specific goals; i) to extend the scope of current Rayleigh lidar measurements to characterize a wider range of waves than previously measured ii) to combine lower-resolution global data from satellite observations and meteorological analyses with higher-resolution data from Arctic Rayleigh lidar systems to document both the synoptic conditions and wave activity. iii) to investigate the observed wave behavior using a comprehensive general circulation model to understand the wave mean-flow interactions.  The proposed activity will provide a comprehensive analysis of the circulation of the Arctic atmosphere that will directly address the following specific studies; coupling and feedbacks between waves and large-scale circulation; the structure; evolution, and variability of polar vortices and anticyclones; links between the middle and lower atmosphere; and atmospheric tele-connections.  The study will advance our understanding of wave mean-flow interactions both regionally and globally that is critical for understanding dynamical driving of the circulation and the evolution of the climate.

The arc is home to about 145 volcanoes of which 52 have erupted in historic time.  The eruptive activity of these volcanoes ranges from continuous small explosions to devastatingly large eruptions such as the one that occurred at Katmai in 1912. Volcanic activity in the Aleutian Arc is a result of subduction of the Pacific plate beneath the North American plate. During this process, volatile elements such as water, carbon and nitrogen that are locked up in the sediments and oceanic crust are slowly transferred into the region deep under the Aleutian Arc volcanoes.  Under high pressure the volatiles are squeezed out of the subducting plate into the overlying (mantle) region, where they help to melt rock and generate magma.  The lower density of the magma and volatiles compared to the surrounding rock allows these fluids to ascend to the Earth's surface where the magma ultimately erupts through volcanism and the gases are released to the atmosphere.  While it is well-known that volatiles play a significant role in both generating magma and influencing eruption explosivity, it is currently not well understood how the source of volatiles (subducted plate, mantle and crust) and the amount of volatiles released over time (e.g. their flux), may influence volcanic eruption size, explosivity and frequency. This project aims to constrain the process of volatile subduction and release through volcanism in the poorly studied Western Aleutians, and to provide insight into volcanic activity. <br/><br/>The Western and Central portions of the Aleutian Volcanic Arc are the ideal locations to investigate the influence of subduction angle, rate and sediment composition on magma generation and volatile flux. The subduction rate and sediment flux increases along the arc from Kiska, the western-most volcano, to Cleveland, located within the central region of the arc. Additionally, the number of historic eruptions within Central Aleutian volcanoes appears to be greater in number than compared to the Western Aleutian volcanoes. Through a previous expedition volcanic gas samples, gas emission measurements and explosively erupted lava samples were collected at five Western Aleutian volcanoes. Through this project these samples will be analyzed for their chemical and isotopic composition and measurements will be used to compute the fluxes of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen and water to the atmosphere. Constraints on the quantity and type of material subducted into the Aleutian Arc from previous studies will be compared to the composition of volatile and lava outputs, as well as the total flux of volatiles measured here, to provide insight into volatile cycling and magma generation. This information will be compared to historic data on eruption size, style and frequency for each of the target volcanoes to identify possible links between subduction character and volcanic activity, to ultimately help improve eruption forecasting and hazard mitigation."

Infrasound, or low frequency sound waves, is becoming increasingly used to monitor and study volcanic eruptions. Volcanic jets are prolific producers of volcanic jet noise, the sound produced by turbulent flow from a volcanic vent. Volcanic jet noise was heard extensively during the 2018 Kilauea East Rift Zone eruption. Despite its increasing use, many questions on volcanic jet noise remain. The investigators will perform a systematic set of linked field and laboratory experiments to address fundamental questions on volcanic jet noise and assumptions typically made when interpreting volcano infrasound data. The lab experiments will be performed at the unique facility of project collaborator LMU (Munich, Germany) that can reproduce gas and particle jets under controlled source parameters. At Stromboli Volcano, Italy, the researchers will examine jetting from eruptions and determine the jet noise radiation pattern. The observations from the lab and field will be used to interpret and determine source parameters (e.g. jet velocity and flux) for eruptions at both Kilauea and Stromboli, as well as previously collected volcano infrasound data. The project results will have significant implications for hazard monitoring at volcano observatories in Alaska and Hawaii, the results will be presented to the general public in those regions, and broad international collaboration and training will occur. <br/><br/>This project will integrate unique lab and field observations of volcanic jet noise to provide new insight into volcanic eruptions. The lab experiments will, for the first time, simulate the generation of volcanic jet noise while varying sound-influencing parameters such as particle concentration, particle shape, vent geometry, temperature, and Mach number. The field experiment at Stromboli Volcano, Italy will address the assumed highly directional nature of volcanic jet noise using advantageous topography and reliable eruptive activity, as well as providing critical corresponding high-speed visual and infrared imagery. The investigators will also capitalize on near-source infrasound and visual data collected during the 2018 Kilauea fissure eruption. By combining these three data sets, the researchers will determine the principal features and complexities of volcanic jet noise, including the characteristic frequency spectra, highly directional sound radiation, and unique waveform characteristics. These analyses will help determine 1) new scaling laws relating jet velocity to acoustic power and 2) improved eruption source constraints such as particle content and jet diameter, thus having direct implications for understanding and monitoring of volcanic eruptions worldwide. <br/><br/>This award is cofunded by the Prediction of and Resilience against Extreme Events (PREEVENTS) program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These activities include high temperature industrial processes such as smelting, coal combustion, and incineration, as well as leaded gasoline consumption during the middle portion of the 20th century.  Lead from these sources moves as fine particles around the world by the atmosphere?s winds and eventually deposits on the surface ocean where it dissolves. Fortunately, it is possible to determine the different origins of these Pb sources (e.g. U.S., European, and Asian inputs) from its isotopic composition (isotopes are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons in the nucleus).  Lead has been shown to have different isotope ratios because the Pb has been extracted from mineral deposits from different geological periods.  This project aims to determine how much of this Pb has moved into the deep North Pacific by ocean circulation or by attaching to sinking particles. This will be done by collecting seawater samples from the surface to the bottom of the ocean at about 30 stations between Tahiti and Alaska and analyzing these for their Pb concentration and Pb isotope ratios. This project will also determine variations in the chromium (Cr) isotope composition of Pacific seawater that are created when the lighter isotopes of Cr are selectively removed from the ocean in extremely low oxygen zones in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. This tool can help understand the ongoing evolution of decreasing oxygen in the ocean and past changes in the oxygen in the ocean established from geological archives such as sediments.<br/><br/> The first measurements of anthropogenic Pb in the ocean resulted in a profile in the North Pacific Ocean by Schaule and Patterson in 1981, and since then several labs have sparsely and erratically measured other profiles showing that the Pb in the Pacific Ocean is responding to regional changes in Pb fluxes - from the phasing out of leaded gasoline (mainly in Japan, Canada, Mexico, and the United States) to increasing amounts of coal combustion (mainly in China). The concentration of Pb decreased near Hawaii by a factor of two between 1981 and the present, and the 206Pb/207Pb isotopic composition of Pb decreased from ~1.20 (mainly U.S. Pb) to 1.165 (mainly Chinese coal Pb). The U.S. GEOTRACES Pacific Meridional Transect cruise will give us an unprecedented opportunity to obtain a detailed view of the penetration of anthropogenic Pb into the deep Pacific Ocean which can be used to determine the pathways that dissolved and particulate Pb take in arriving in the deep sea. This project will also determine the stable isotope composition of Cr, an element whose redox state is determined by the oxygen (O2) concentration in the ocean. In oxygen deficient zones (ODZs) where [O2] < 2 µmol/kg, Cr is reduced from chromate CrO4-2 (hexavalent chromium) to Cr3+ ion (trivalent chromium). The isotopically lighter atoms of Cr are preferentially reduced, and the reduced Cr3+ ion is ""particle-reactive"" (attaches to sinking particles) and removed from the water column. That leaves the residual Cr isotopically heavier, so we can detect this process by measurements of 53Cr/52Cr. This process occurs in conjunction with nitrogen reduction (denitrification) and can be used to trace the consequences as ODZ waters mix out into the oxic ocean."

Beaufort Sea shelf break upwelling may be increasing in frequency in response to recent large-scale atmospheric changes, potentially increasing the importance of the shelf-break environment for a range of upper trophic level animals. This grant will support research to increase our understanding of the importance of&#8232;the region to upper trophic levels such as beluga&#8232;whales, seabirds, and seals, provide a mechanistic understanding of the linked atmosphere-ocean- plankton-predator system, and predict future consequences and impacts of environmental change&#8232;on this system. <br/><br/>A substantial communications program built upon long-standing, well-established relationships&#8232;between the researchers and Alaska North Slope communities and subsistence organizations is planned both to coordinate the planned sampling and to convey the results of the research back to the communities. Information will be disseminated locally before and during two research cruises using a range of media including daily email reports, Facebook pages, blogs, interviews on local radio stations, and flyers. A comprehensive project&#8232;report, a summary report written in straightforward English, and a poster describing results&#8232;will be disseminated to the North Slope communities. Project members will also present results&#8232;of the research in local lecture series or to interested local organizations. Involvement&#8232;of a K-12 teacher in at least one of the cruises is planned. Both cruises will have&#8232;the participation of a local community observer who will communicate directly with local communities during the cruise and share local knowledge with the science party. <br/><br/>The Beaufort Sea shelf break experiences frequent upwelling of deep, nutrient rich basin water&#8232;onto the shelf. Such upwelling is not only a short-term source of heat, salt, and nutrients, and a mechanism promoting elevated primary production (production response), but it also transports populations between ocean regions and depth strata or regimes (physical response), potentially modifying ecosystem structure and availability of zooplankton and fish prey to upper trophic&#8232;level consumers. The Beaufort Sea shelf break is a domain of enhanced abundance of upper&#8232;trophic level animals, presumably in response to elevated availability of their prey. Here&#8232;we propose to explore and identify the mechanisms linking broad-scale atmospheric forcing, ocean physical response, prey-base condition and distribution, upper trophic level animal aggregations, and climate change along the Beaufort Shelf break. Our overarching hypothesis&#8232;is that atmospherically-forced (wind-induced) upwelling along this shelf break leads to enhanced feeding opportunities for intermediate links in the pelagic ecosystem (zooplankton, forage&#8232;fish) that in turn sustain the exploitation of this environment by animals such as beluga&#8232;whales, seabirds, and seals. This hypothesis will be addressed using a combination of ship-based fieldwork, long-term moorings equipped with physical and biological sensors, and syntheses of retrospective and projected model output and longer-term data. The distributions, abundances, condition, and biology of multiple trophic levels will&#8232;be described within the context of the dynamics of the physical environment to expand our understanding of trophic linkages and the importance of shelf-break upwelling to that system. Physical and biological model output and retrospective data will be synthesized with the mechanistic understanding gained during the field program to retrospectively characterize wind-driven&#8232;upper trophic level ecosystem variability and predict how the ecosystem may respond to future projections of these atmospheric drivers and ice-ocean conditions."

While indigenous peoples of the north have a long history of adaptation to environmental change, the limits to their adaptive capacity may be challenged because of these emergent conditions. This project will utilize agent-based modeling (ABM)to elucidate the decision making process that rural subsistence based communities undergo in a changing environment. <br/><br/>Through ABM the research team will investigate the linkages between cultural adaptations and the subsistence resources harvested by indigenous communities that have developed a mixed, subsistence-cash, economy.  The PIs partner with two local communities of the North Slope and Interior Alaska to document how current environmental changes are affecting subsistence harvesting. Local knowledge and quantitative analysis are coupled together as the basis for modeling subsistence harvesters' decisions in order to understand adaptation in conditions of ecological, economic, and social change.  In addition, the researchers hope to identify the potential tradeoffs that emerge with changing social-ecological conditions. <br/><br/>A spatially explicit ABM that focuses on the multi-species seasonal round will be developed and used to explore the implications of three interacting drivers of change - climate change, changing fuel costs, and changes in land-use, which are likely to affect harvesters? choices and adaptive strategies. This research seeks to operational concepts espoused as part of resilience theory, and provide a means for modeling these systems and improving our understanding of the dynamics of social-ecological systems."

Change in climate forcing will be determined from coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (GCM) simulations made for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).  The twentieth century hindcasts from these models differ in terms of their ability to replicate past observed conditions; a subset of the better models will be used to project the trends, variability and uncertainty of the climate of the Bering Sea through the first half of the 21st century.  This ensemble of GCM model results will be used primarily for dynamical downscaling, i.e., as initial and boundary conditions for high-resolution ocean model experiments with the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS).  The ROMS simulations are designed to properly handle physical processes known to be important on the Bering Sea shelf, such as sea ice, tides, and cross-shelf exchange; these results will form the direct input for embedded spatially-explicit nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) and food web model experiments. <br/><br/>This project is part of a larger program designed to develop understanding of the integrated ecosystem of the eastern Bering Sea shelf, a highly productive region of US coastal waters.  This ecosystem is home to a major portion of the commercial fisheries of the US and also provides significant resources to subsistence hunters and fisherman of Alaska.  The model will help to synthesize our current and developing understanding of how this system functions."

To date, STEEP has produced 17 papers with another 9 submitted or nearing submission, sponsored 71 abstracts, will have matriculated 5 masters and 4 Doctoral students by Spring 2010, and fundamentally changed our understanding of Alaskan tectonics and the interaction of tectonics and climate in mountain building.  The renewal funds will be used for:  1) final processing and interpretation of some key datasets that were not acquired until year 5 of the project including the marine seismic survey (ship delays) and reoccupation of key GPS sites (weather problems in 2008); and  2) a complete integration of results which was not possible until now due to these delays. A complete integration and synthesis of these superb datasets has the potential to be transformative in our understanding of how crustal structure and tectonic forces interact with Earth surface processes of glacial erosion and sedimentary transport to grow a mountain range and a massive continental shelf."

This orogen has developed over the past few million years as the Yakutat block, a continental-oceanic terrane,  has attempted subduction beneath the eastern end of the Aleutian arc-trench system.  The ~500 km-long, 150 km-wide St. Elias mountain range is the product of the dynamic balance between rapid uplift induced by crustal convergence and rapid exhumation by a regional system of large, fast-moving temperate glaciers.  Most sediments are deposited either on a broad shelf or in deepsea fans and provide a complete record of the tectonic, climatic, erosional, and eustatic events that have accompanied the orogeny.  <br/><br/>The overarching goal of the project is to develop a comprehensive model for the St. Elias orogen that accounts for the interaction of regional plate tectonic processes, structural development, and rapid erosion.  The focus of the study is on the partitioning of deformation within the system from upper mantle flow to near-surface faulting and exhumation.  The study will investigate the geodynamics of oblique collision under a set of conditions that will allow the PIs to address several important and fundamental questions:<br/><br/>- Has intense Quaternary glacial erosion redistributed mass in the orogen sufficiently to change regional deformational patterns, and has focused erosion along deep glacial valleys been sufficient to localize crustal strains?<br/>- How is deformation partitioned into lithospheric shortening and uplift versus lateral extrusion of the detached crust, and does intense erosion influence this partitioning?<br/>- Is the orogeny driven primarily by subduction of a buoyant oceanic plateau or by collision of a small microcontinental block attached to allochthonous ocean crust?<br/><br/>Addressing these questions has broad implications for understanding the geodynamics of oblique collision in general, the role of different mechanisms in development of far-field orogenic effects, and the control of erosion on development of slip partitioning during oblique convergence.  The project also has general implications for how subduction/accretion of small continental terranes versus oceanic plateaus contribute to deformation of the continents, and ultimately the fate of these fragments in construction of the crustal collage which is typical of virtually all continents.  Specifically, the P.I.s propose a multidisciplinary approach involving seismologists (subsurface imaging and seismicity), geologists, geodesists, glaciologists, geochronologists, and geodynamic modelers.<br/><br/><br/>"

Over the millenia, the Gwich'in have developed a detailed knowledge of caribou body parts: not only sundry names and uses for these parts but an encyclopedia of traditional stories, songs, games, family names, foodways, and ceremonies associated with them. The project's research objective is to discover what the Gwich'in Athabaskan people, as a small-scale subarctic society, can teach the nation through their language and world view about living in harmony with the land and with the wild game animals they share it with. To realize this goal the researchers will interview active hunters and elders in their home communities of Arctic Village, Venetie, and Fort Yukon in northeast Alaska, and Old Crow, Tsiigehtchic, and Fort McPherson in northwest Canada.<br/><br/>A fundamental question for the research is not only what do the Gwich'in know about caribou anatomy, but how do they see caribou and what do they say and believe about caribou that defines themselves, their dietary and nutritional needs, and their subsistence way of life? Language is the key. Gwich'in, an endangered language with four living dialects, is a member of the Na-Dene language family, and the fieldwork plan includes speakers of all four of those dialects.  An important part of the plan is to train young speakers and language learners in basic transcription and translation skills.<br/><br/>Recording the traditional ethnoscientific knowledge Gwich'in elders have about caribou in their corpus of oral narratives and in their lexicon has farreaching implications for zooarchaeology, for applied linguistics, and for folklore and cultural anthropology. It is an empirical approach which essentially weds natural science with the humanities, osteology with verbal art."

By understanding these two processes, one regional, one local, the PIs expect to link snow cover to the general atmospheric circulation and large scale climate, yet still understand its impact on the arctic landscape and ecosystem at the local scale.  The research program will combine field observations and physically-based numerical modeling to do two specific tasks: 1) understand, measure, and predict the depth distribution of the snow cover at a range of scales, and 2) understand, measure, and predit the variation in physical properties of the snow pack at the same scales.  The measurements will allow the PIs to establish relationships between snow properties and weather, to investigate the interaction of snow and shrubs, and to test models.  The predictions will require development and integration of snow distribution and atmospheric models, which in turn will be tested against measurements.  These models can be used subsequently to investigate how the Arctic might respond to changes in climate."

In this way one can gain                       insight into the molecular composition of aerosol samples broken                down by size class; it is also possible with TDEX to derive                     information on the state of mixing of aerosols and to infer the                 presence of surfactant films on aerosol cores.

Arctic ground squirrels have unique adaptations that allow them to thrive under arctic conditions. The proposed work will resolve important questions in hibernation physiology using integrated approaches including respirometry for measuring rates of metabolism and respiratory exchange, stable isotope analysis for assessing changes in metabolic fuel use and body composition, and genomic approaches for a molecular understanding of hibernation in extreme conditions. This project seeks to 1) elucidate which metabolic fuels (fat, carbohydrate, protein) arctic ground squirrels draw from during arctic hibernation, 2) quantify the expression of genes for enzymes involved in metabolic fuel selection, 3) identify lower thermal limits to hibernation at sub-zero body temperatures, and 4) continue monitoring body and hibernacula temperatures in a natural population on the North Slope of Alaska.  These field measures will be related to changes in body condition over winter, annual timing of hibernation and other life history events, and effects on reproduction and persistence of this population in the context of climate change.  It is anticipated that arctic ground squirrels will hibernate in ambient temperatures as low as -40 degrees C, and that they will increase reliance on protein to fuel metabolism with decreasing ambient temperatures.  At low temperatures, regulation of metabolic fuel selection by arctic ground squirrels will be accomplished via increased expression of genes that promote protein metabolism and gluconeogenesis (synthesis of sugar).  Because hibernators have been used as models for cerebral ischemia (reduced blood flow to the brain), traumatic head injury, and hypothermia, investigations of the physiology and genomics of hibernation have biomedical implications.  Moreover, this research will help us better understand organismal responses to a changing climate in the sensitive arctic ecosystem. This project is interdisciplinary and will provide training, in both field and lab settings, to 1 post-doc, 2 PhD students and undergraduates in molecular, isotopic, physiological and ecological techniques. It is international with a collaborating scientist from the Shanghai Institutes of Biology in China. Results of this research will be disseminated through publications and presentations at regional, national and international meetings and local interpretive displays."

The overarching goals of this research are to (1) explore the sea-ice/terrain/vegetation linkages by synthesizing a group of recently available long-term circumpolar databases, (2) examine how the vegetation of the circumpolar Arctic is responding to global climate change, and (3) use this information in combination with models to help predict future response of arctic vegetation. The project will address directly the question of how the terrestrial vegetation of the Arctic has responded to climate change to date and how it will respond in the future as portions of the Arctic Ocean become seasonally ice free as indicated by current understanding of trends in sea ice. An average 17% increase in greenness, as measured by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), occurred in northern Alaska from 1981 to 2001, concomitant with strong ice retreat in the Beaufort Sea and rising land-surface temperatures. The trend in NDVI is consistent with observations regarding shrub cover, modeling, and experimental evidence linking temperature increases to biomass increases. The group will synthesize 23+ years of data from Earth orbiting satellites in combination with detailed circumpolar maps of climate, vegetation, terrain, and substrate variables to determine how the ocean and land have interacted during the years of record, and then use this information to improve existing models of Arctic vegetation change. They will use primarily a time series of surface temperature, sea-ice, and NDVI data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR) aboard the NOAA satellites. A host of other remote sensing data will complement these to extend the length of the record and to look at finer scale changes. The primary region of study is the circumpolar Arctic as defined by the presence of tundra vegetation and an Arctic climate. A larger area defined by the arctic watershed will be studied in less detail. They will create a circumpolar integrated geographic information system for this region. The NDVI patterns will be analyzed spatially and temporally with respect to mapped variables including land-surface temperatures (LSTs), sea-ice patterns, the age of the terrain, substrate, topography, elevation, and regional floras. They will use vegetation change models to determine if the greening detected thus far can be used to project future patterns of vegetation change in the Arctic. A spatial analysis using BIOME4, a global model of vegetation change, will predict changes in the patterns of arctic and boreal plant communities, and ArcVeg, a model of arctic vegetation dynamics, will link the changes detected using remote sensing to ground-based measurements of plant species composition and structure to examine the rates at which changes can be expected. <br/>"

Ampeliscid amphipods are the major prey of gray whales and a significant proportion of the eastern Pacific (California) whale population feeds in the northern Bering Sea. Although the gray whale population has been growing at a rate of 3.29%/yr since 1980, there has been over a three-fold increase in whale mortality in the last year. It has been suggested that this increase in mortality may be due to starvation. A 30% decline in amphipod secondary production between 1986-1988 indicated that the whales may have been approaching the carrying capacity of the Bering Sea amphipod community at that time. Today, they may be food limited.<br/><br/>In addition to whale predation, declines in amphipod production, abundance and biomass could be due to a decrease in primary production or changes in phytoplankton species composition, resulting in declines of carbon flux to the seabed. In addition, a temperature regime shift due to recent El Nino events or global warming might also impact ampeliscid populations. This effort will reoccupy stations sampled from 1986 to 1988, using identical techniques. Specifically, it will measure the abundance, biomass, size composition, species composition and production of the ampeliscid amphipod community in the Chirikov Basin, northern Bering Sea. These measurements will permit documention of changes that may have occurred in the feeding regime of the gray whales between 1988 and 2001. Due to their low growth rates and long generation times, the ampeliscid community may be slow to recover from substantial declines in abundance, biomass and production. Given their central role in energy transfer to apex predators, declines in amphipod production, whatever the cause, are likely to alter the ecological community structure in the Chirikov Basin. Such changes may effect not only wildlife and fish resources in the region, but may also negatively impact the native subsistence communities in both Siberia and Alaska.<br/>"

This will be accomplished through an integrated project that includes field sampling, laboratory analyses and modeling. Pink salmon occupy surface waters of the continental shelf in the summer and fall after entering marine waters in the spring. In that period they grow rapidly and their feeding changes from small zooplankton in the summer to large zooplankton in the fall. This project will document temporal and spatial variation in prey use and availability, it will assess the effects of the shelf environment by measuring condition of pink salmon, and it will use spatially- explicit foraging/bioenergetic modeling to understand observed patterns in feeding, growth and condition. Fish of hatchery origin, identified by thermal otolith marks, will be of particular interest, as the marine survival of each hatchery cohort will be available a year after those fish enter the marine environment.<br/><br/>Spatial and temporal variation in pink salmon diets and surface zooplankton will be described through laboratory analyses of field samples, and the basis for diet shifts to larger prey will be determined by calculations of prey selectivity. Standard length/weight condition measures will be calculated, and the energy content of salmon will be measured by calorimetry. The relationship between condition, growth and the environment will be examined. Habitat quality over the continental shelf will be assessed with spatially explicit models with foraging and bioenergetic components that produce weight- specific estimates of growth potential. Bioenergetic modeling will also be used to estimate daily ration and seasonal consumption by pink salmon. The relationship between diets of pink salmon and other planktivorous fishes will be assessed.<br/><br/>This research will contribute directly to accomplishment of the GLOBEC program goal of understanding how production of upper trophic level species is linked to variation in oceanographic conditions. It is widely accepted that production of salmon in the GOA is determined by planktonic production. Detailed descriptions of spatial and temporal variation in diet, prey availability, temperature, and fish condition will substantially enhance our understanding of the connections between the marine environment and salmon production.<br/><br/>"

Although light and nutrients have been studied for decades as the determinants of ice-algal production, more complex synergistic effects between ice algae and other microbial residents of sea ice that may foster primary production are poorly known. Studies of sea-ice bacteria and algae, including genomic evaluations, have revealed potential links between compounds called compatible solutes (CS), commonly used by microbes to protect against osmotic shock (death by cell explosion) in high-salinity surroundings, and the availability of regenerated nitrogen within the ice. This research will test a seasonal-synergy hypothesis whereby CS precursor compounds (like choline) that are released by ice algae during fall freeze-up are taken up by bacteria in the ice, converted to CS for survival in the high-salinity brines of winter sea ice, and then metabolized for carbon, nitrogen and energy as spring temperatures warm, salinities freshen, and the need to retain CS as osmoprotectants diminishes. An important end product of this bacterial conversion of CS is ammonia, increasing the within-ice availability of nitrogen to ice algae on the verge of blooming as photosynthetically active radiation penetrates the ice. Elements of this proposed seasonal synergy between bacteria and algae encased in sea ice will be examined by a combination of field and laboratory approaches. Sea-ice brines will be collected during fall freeze-up and spring-bloom periods and tested for bacterial uptake of choline, conversion to CS, and remineralization, using radiolabeled and stable isotope-based incubations and spectroscopic methods. The latter will reveal the key bacterial phylotypes responsible for a CS-based seasonal synergy within sea ice. Measurements of temperature, salinity, pH, bacterial and viral abundances, chlorophyll pigments, and extracellular polysaccharide substances will provide environmental and biological context. Pure cultures of available and newly acquired (on CS- based media) sea-ice bacteria will be examined across temperature and salinity gradients to clarify the key processes.<br/><br/>This award will help to launch the faculty career of a polar early career scientist and provide unique training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students in the field, in the laboratory, at the computer, and in outreach efforts in Washington State, Alaska and Greenland. By conducting the proposed field research from the Greenland Climate Research Center in Nuuk, Greenland, this US team will foster international cooperation among scientists from the US, Greenland and Denmark, adding to the outcome and continuing pan-Arctic goals of the recently completed International Polar Year."

Some of these changes are on pace with predictions of the late 1990s, but others have occurred much more rapidly than expected. Many of the documented and anticipated shifts in the Arctic are linked to environmental change: changing sea ice and snow cover, coastal erosion leading to displacement of modern villages and destruction of preserved archaeological sites, questions of subsistence food security, increased shipping and oil exploration, with their associated economic impacts (positive and negative) and risk of oil spills, to name just a few. Many other changes in the Arctic are largely independent of changing climate: continued loss of Native languages, high rates of unemployment, domestic violence and substance abuse, and the increased influence of social media among and between isolated communities of the high north. Yet, while the North has always seemed remote and marginal to global or US national interests, Arctic people and environments are increasingly connected socially, economically, and environmentally to those living to the south.<br/> <br/>The potential for an increasingly ice-free Arctic Ocean, for example, opens up possibilities for new shipping routes shifting economic costs and benefits for global markets, for expanded exploitation of the circumpolar basin?s fossil fuel and mineral resources,  and for attendant new focus on the north as an economic and security zone of strategic and tactical importance. All of these potential transformations have impacts not only on the United States? northernmost communities, but also on the global and national economic, social, and cultural systems best studied by social scientists in interdisciplinary collaborations capable of providing information and strategies of need for policy development and community development.   The National Science Foundation?s Arctic Social Sciences Program (ASSP) is the leading source of funding for U.S.-based social sciences research in the Arctic. Just as the Arctic has changed, arctic social sciences have experienced substantial growth and development, transitioning from an emerging field of research to a well-established multidisciplinary research area; yet the research priorities for NSF?s Arctic Social Sciences program were last updated in 1999.  <br/><br/>The Arctic Horizons project will bring together members of the Arctic social science research and indigenous communities to reassess the goals, potentials, and needs of these diverse communities and ASSP within the context of a rapidly changing circumpolar North.

Preliminary results show that fluxes                 through roots may constitute a significant percentage of the                    total carbon budget of these ecosystems, thus this research project             has implications beyond the immediate questions of forest                       successional dynamics, pertinent to the broader topic of dynamic                ecosystem modelling and global land-atmosphere carbon exchanges.                %%%                                                                             This belowground research instrumentation to be used at the                     Bonanza Creek Long-term Ecological Research site will provide new               insights into the structure and function of taiga ecosystems and                serve to couple many of the research disciplines on the LTER                    project.

The SAR images from ERS-2 and RADARSAT will be acquired at the McMurdo ground station, and processed at the Alaska SAR Facility.  These will provide information about the large-scale ice motion field and the small-scale ice deformation field, both of which contribute to the observed ice thickness distribution.  In addition, a study of the spatial and temporal variation of the backscattered microwave energy will contribute to the development of numerical models that simulate the dynamic and thermodynamic interactions among the sea ice, ocean, and atmosphere.

The scarce observations available from the Bering Sea indicate that ice algal production may be as high as 30% of the phytoplankton production; during times of ice cover, ice algal biomass can be nearly as high as integrated pelagic algal biomass. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that sea ice algae are the major food source for pelagic and benthic herbivores in spring, specifically during periods of ice melt. In addressing this hypothesis, this proposal aims at providing information on the spatial and temporal patterns of abundance, biomass, community composition and productivity of sea ice algae and phytoplankton just below the ice in relation to the physical and chemical environment. Environmental measurements will include salinity, temperature, and nutrient concentrations in ice cores and under-ice water, as well as ice thickness, snow cover and light regime. Sedimenting material, stable isotope ratios (d13C, d15N) and algal community composition will be used as three lines of evidence to follow the fate of ice algal production through the pelagic and into the benthic food web of the Bering Sea. Field work conducted during different ice cover regimes will be augmented with experimental work on pelagic and benthic herbivores, producing the first-ever stable isotope turnover rate measurements for any Bering Sea invertebrates. The combined data set will allow for a refined interpretation of the relevance of the sea ice produced organic matter for the food web structure in the Bering Sea.<br/><br/>This project is part of a larger program designed to develop understanding of the integrated ecosystem of the eastern Bering Sea shelf, a highly productive region of US coastal waters.  This ecosystem is home to a major portion of the commercial fisheries of the US and also provides significant resources to subsistence hunters and fisherman of Alaska.  Understanding role of sea ice algae in this system is essential to being able to predict how and why the system may respond to changes in sea ice conditions, such as have been observed in recent years.<br/>"

Both projects will contribute to an understanding of religious phenomena occurring in the interstices between more readily recognized spaces of organized and institutionally supported religion. One of these projects will investigate new religious movements, voluntarism and social mechanisms of durability in Kamchatka by focusing on the local meaning of the building of religious structures. The durability of religious experience will be contrasted with notions of heritage and tradition, especially in smaller indigenous communities.  The PI will examine memory, participation and anticipation as experiential modes of past, present and future. This will elucidate the particular temporal qualities associated with religious experience and practice. The other project will investigate missionaries, humanitarian aid, and the ideology of neoliberalism by exploring the connections between missionary groups in Alaska and their target communities in Magadan. Rather than focusing on the religious aspects of the conversion experience, the project examines the impact of missionary activity on local economic ideology and practice. Understanding the social dynamics of the missionary encounter in the Russian Far East is particularly important in the context of moves by the Russian government and the Russian Orthodox Church to inhibit foreign missionary activity in Russia."

The hypothesis is that the distribution of basal stress is related to the internal deformation field, and that temporal changes in basal conditions manifest themselves not only as changes in surface motion, but as changes in internal deformation. Such changes in internal deformation can be relatively large given the non-linear rheology of ice and the sensitivity of basal processes to variations in effective pressure. The Principal Investigators will investigate the mechanisms of basal motion using these ideas on Black Rapids Glacier, Alaska. They have previously documented the presence of a subglacial till layer and have some knowledge of its properties. Observational and modeling studies have shown that water pressure fluctuations cause changes in the strength of this till, and that these spatial and temporal changes in basal conditions then lead to measurable changes in the ice deformation field.  Six boreholes will be drilled along a cross section where the till exists, and a seventh will be drilled further downglacier. They will be instrumented with tilt sensors for continuous monitoring of borehole deformation and with pressure transducers for monitoring basal water pressure. They will also measure surface velocities across the transects, and their temporal fluctuations. The observational study will be initiated before the annual spring speed-up event and carried through the summer, when various motion events occur. Logging will then continue through the more steady conditions of the winter season. A finite element model of ice deformation will then be used to interpret these data in terms of the distribution of basal shear stress and the underlying mechanisms of basal motion throughout the annual cycle. The proposed project will take full advantage of synergetic collaboration with an existing, funded program to install tilt sensors deep in the underlying basal till at the same location as our central borehole. Taken together, the Principal Investigators will be able to obtain a more complete picture of basal processes and of the interdependence of basal  motion and ice deformation. Such interdependence is usually neglected in simple models of ice flow and the response of glaciers to climate variations.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

These results will then be compared with findings from ongoing research across the interior of Alaska.  <br/><br/>Some of the questions that will be answered by this research are; ""Have past changes in precipitation-evaporation balance occurred in the upper Yukon and have they occurred on time scales relevant to humans? Did these changes occur synchronously and in the same direction across the Yukon?  Were they synchronous with changes in other regions? Did vegetation respond to climate change?"""

Wrangell Volcano, Alaska. Changes in heat flux have previously been observed at Mt. Wrangell following large earthquakes in 1964 and 1979. The earthquake of 3 November 2002 on the Denali Fault, Mw = 7.9, may have had a similar or stronger effect on heat flux because the shaking was more intense. The hypothesis to be tested is that seismic shaking opens convective channels beneath the ice-filled North Crater. This in turn allows glacier melt water to circulate more efficiently, and deeply enough to increase heat flux to the base of the glacier ice. This shows up as a change in the ice volume, which will be measured by photogrammetry in summer 2003. Seismic behavior will also be monitored with stations on the volcano's summit and flanks. In terms of broader impacts, this proposal crosses three disciplines--volcanology, glaciology and seismology-and seeks to establish a physical basis for interactions among these generally separate lines of inquiry. Two UAF graduate students will be involved in the data and interpretations, and public lectures will be given in the Glenallen and Copper Center communities, as well as at the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park visitor center. <br/>"

Basaltic magmas from the subduction wedge are<br/>channeled to volcanoes separated by tens or hundreds of kilometers and evolve<br/>into silica-rich compositions associated with dome growth, pyroclastic flows<br/>and explosive eruptions. Decades of geochemical research have outlined a suite<br/>of processes which control the chemical and spatial evolution of these<br/>volcanoes. These ideas, which rely heavily on processes in the lowermost crust,<br/>have evolved with limited input from geophysics because the deep crust has been<br/>difficult to probe with seismics, gravity, and/or electromagnetics. The Colima<br/>Deep Seismic Experiment is one of the first to target the deep crustal<br/>processes which create discrete volcanoes and ultimately control eruptive<br/>behavior. In conjunction with the Observatorio Vulcanologico of Colima<br/>University in Mexico, the PI will install and maintain a seismic array for 18<br/>months in the vicinity of Colima Volcano. The Observatorio is responsible for<br/>monitoring Colima Volcano, which is in the midst of an on-going eruption cycle,<br/>and seismicity throughout the state of Colima which has had two earthquakes<br/>greater than magnitude 7.5 in the last ten years. This project will be<br/>co-deployed with the arc-scale network of Grand and Ni (EAR #0335782) which is<br/>serendipitously centered on Colima. This array of intermediate-band instruments<br/>will be wider than a typical volcano monitoring array and is designed to<br/>optimize seismic tomography and receiver functions of the deep crust.<br/>Teleseismic data, together with seismicity in the local crust and subducting<br/>slab, will be used to map the temperature and melt conditions beneath Colima<br/>Volcano. The results will be interpreted in the context of existing geochemical<br/>models for the Colima complex to address two primary questions. (i) Is the<br/>location and longevity of an arc volcano governed principally by diapirism in<br/>the mantle wedge or by deep crustal conditions and Moho topography? (ii) What<br/>are the relative roles of magma ponding at the base of the crust and magma<br/>storage in the lower crust in controlling the evolution of subduction basalts<br/>into more silicic arc volcanics? These questions, though ideally suited to<br/>Colima, have implications at all arc volcanoes.

Two minerals that commonly show these features are plagioclase and amphibole, exhibiting sieve, dusty, and patchy zoning (dissolution and growth) and reaction rims (degassing and heating) respectively. These textures are often used to estimate the rates of magma mixing and magmatic ascent processes. We propose to experimentally constrain the rates at which these textures form at conditions applicable to shallow-level crustal reservoirs, using natural (rhyo)dacite and andesite starting material, and clean, unzoned, euhedral seed crystals. Our goal for this proposed study is to provide the vital calibrations needed to make observations of these reaction textures quantitatively useful for volcanologists when examining the products of crustal magma reservoirs. Previous work (refs) investigating the rates and causes of these textures have provided a good basis for our proposed study.  However, limitations to this work exist, necessitating further study to make constraints useful to a wide range of mineral-melt compositions and P-T conditions applicable to crustal magma reservoirs. We will accomplish our goals in two tasks that are designed to experimentally constrain the rates of dissolution and regrowth textures in plagioclase resulting from heating and compositional disequilibrium, and amphibole reaction rims produced by melt degassing or heating. The first task will focus on plagioclase dissolution and rim growth in Aniakchak rhyodacite and andesite, using plagioclase seed phenocrysts of An20, An37, and An80 composition, at pressures between 0.1 and 300 MPa and temperatures between 825 and 1100 degrees C. The goal of this task is to constrain rates of plagioclase dissolution as a function of heating above the plagioclase solidus, and to examine dissolution and re-growth of plagioclase due to chemical disequilibrium in melts in which plagioclase of another composition is stable.  The second task will investigate pargasite and hornblende amphibole breakdown in Redoubt dacite and andesite at P-T conditions appropriate for amphibole stability in these compositions. The goal of this task is to extend known calibrations of this reaction to different melt compositions and magmatic conditions. In addition, the thermal breakdown of amphibole will be investigated in order to help petrologists distinguish between decompression and heating rims. The results of these studies will be constraints on the rates of formation of important plagioclase and amphibole reaction textures in shallow-level crustal reservoirs.<br/><br/>"

The boreal forest plays a central role in global biogeochemical cycling due to its abundance and because it stores approximately 30% of the earth's reactive carbon. Hence, fungal diversity and function in the boreal forest are compelling subjects for metagenomic scrutiny.  This project will undertake the most detailed examination to date of fungal diversity, genetic relationships and substrate specificity within a single geographic region. In the first step, 32,000 clones from PCR libraries of fungal ribosomal gene-regions amplified from soil DNA extracts will be sequenced. The DNAs will be extracted from key soil substrates (e.g. leaf litter, humus, wood, roots) within each of three forest types that are important components of the northern boreal forest. Discovery of novel fungi and their substrate preferences are anticipated.  In the second step, the same ribosomal region will be sequenced in 4000 dried fruitbodies (e.g. mushrooms) maintained within the UAF Mycological Herbarium. The herbarium specimen sequences will permit below-ground and above-ground views of diversity to be compared, will help identify unknown fungi, and will provide a powerful database for identification of the constituent fungi observed in 'community fingerprints' from a variety of related ecological studies."

It is a mystery how shocks can accelerate particles to energies higher than their own shock potential energy reserve. This project will investigate irregularities in plasma flows ahead of shocks moving into the magnetosphere, studying plasma bubbles and hot flow anomalies. The results of this project have direct applications in space weather models; it thus addresses one of the goals set out in the National Space Weather Action Plan. The project will also help understand shock acceleration throughout the universe. Three early career researchers and a graduate student will receive support.<br/><br/>The key objectives are (i) to determine the role of upstream electron energization on space weather phenomena that result from inward penetration of energetic particles; and (ii) to provide new insights in the classic pre-acceleration need for Fermi type shock acceleration processes. For the first time high quality and resolution THEMIS and MMS data from the foreshock region are available. THEMIS provides data on large scale magnetic structures along with high-frequency magnetic fluctuations and superthermal particles ( >25 keV), while MMS is capable of resolving small scale (10-100 km) high time resolution (30 -150 ms) providing microscale and electron dynamics quantities. The observations will be supplemented by Cluster and DMSP which monitor the energetic particle flux in the cusp and from all sky imagers and NSF-funded SuperDARN data providing signatures of accelerating particles. Combining these observations is a challenging task. The proposal utilizes a well-tested 3D global hybrid simulation code to organize the data and achieve the desired results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, much of the energy input into them is in the first few modes, which can propagate 1000's of kilometers before breaking. As a result, little is known about where and how they break, in spite of the known sensitivity of global circulation models to the geography of mixing. Therefore, this study will construct a global map of low-mode internal tide energy flux and dissipation by application of state-of-the-art techniques to a combination of satellite altimetry, moorings, and a numerical model. The approach captures both the non-uniform barotropic-to-baroclinic tide conversion near rough topography as well as patchiness due to the non-uniform dissipation of low-mode internal tides.<br/><br/>The global coverage of satellite altimeters makes them the only practical observational tool available for the task. However the poor spatial resolution of any single satellite, and the inability of altimetry to detect temporally incoherent signals, have hampered the interpretation of past altimetric estimates of low-mode internal tide energy and energy flux. This study addresses these shortcomings in order to produce the needed global maps:<br/>(1) To address the low-resolution problem, the team will expand on their previous work (in which they used the T/P-Jason tandem mission) by combining multiple satellite altimetric data from T/P- Jason, T/P-Jason tandem, GFO, and ERS. The multi-satellite technique was recently demonstrated in the North Pacific, and showed that spatial resolution is improved to the point where the altimetric estimates agree with high-resolution numerical models.<br/>(2) To understand the loss of coherence of internal tide propagating in an ever-changing ocean, the PIs will analyze a new high-resolution global simulation that includes a realistic internal tide field as well as realistic meso- and large-scale ocean circulations. The model estimate of how the non- uniform moving ocean makes internal tide incoherent will be validated by the analysis of several long moored time series collected around the globe.<br/><br/>With these improvements, the techniques should now be up to the task of mapping the low-mode internal tide's energy flux and dissipation on the globe. In doing so, this project will lead to a better understanding of the processes that affect the propagation and dissipation of internal tide on a global scale.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The primary broader impact of this work will be an improved understanding and a parameterization of the magnitude and geography of dissipation, of known importance to general circulation models. In addition, the team will provide maps of altimetrically-observed internal tide quantities to all researchers as well as the public via a website and/or direct communication with the PI's. In addition to being of great use in planning experiments, such maps will be of relevance for a variety of physical and biogeochemical studies. The maps and the model simulations will be used in community outreach programs such as APL's K-12 volunteer list and Seattle's Pacific Science Center. The study will also educate three undergraduate students as part of the Washington Space Grant program, a joint program between Washington State and NASA seeking to encourage students at the University of Washington to pursue science careers."

A large 15 January 2009 Mw 7.4 thrust earthquake in the same region demonstrated the heightened seismic hazard. The Kuril GPS Array was installed several months before the 2006?2007 earthquakes in collaboration between US and Russian scientists. Observations on the array documented coseismic and postseismic surface deformation following the great Kuril earthquakes. The immediate focus of this final phase of the project is on acquiring irreplaceable, transient postseismic data spanning the time period 2007?2014. This project will continue collaboration between US universities and institutions of the Russian Academy of Sciences.<br/>The data from the Kuril GPS Array collected in 2006?2011 allowed us to develop models of coseismic slip and models of postseismic mechanisms. It was shown that most of the postseismic motion was caused by the viscoelastic relaxation of shear stresses in the weak Maxwell viscosity asthenosphere. From experience with other postseismic studies, longer time series will allow us to develop more robust models of postseismic deformation and models of interseismic frictional coupling on the subduction interface. The complete 8-year-long data set is required to address fundamental problems: How much of the strain built up from subduction of the Pacific plate beneath the North American plate (the Sea of Okhotsk) has been released in the 2006 and 2007 Kuril earthquakes coseismically and postseismically? Is it possible to explain postseismic surface deformation at the Kuril subduction zone with the linear viscous mantle or a stress-dependent rheology is required?

These blackouts severely impact the public, commerce, and government and are a vulnerability in the nation's infrastructure.  Rather than focusing on the detailed causes of individual blackouts, this project addresses the global, complex system dynamics of a long series of blackouts. New models, simulation and analysis methods will be developed to capture the essentials of criticality, self-organization and cascading failure. Particular attention will be given to the power tails of probability distributions of blackout sizes that occur in North American blackout data and generally in systems at criticality.  These power tails imply that large, catastrophic blackouts are much more likely than predicted by conventional risk analyses. The project will develop new risk analysis methods and explore operating techniques to mitigate the risks of major blackouts.  Communication networks such as the Internet also develop major cascading disruptions and work will also be pursued in this application to maintain some focus on universal features of disruptions in large, engineered networks of societal importance. The expected outcomes are the ability to understand, statistically analyze and to some extent mitigate major cascading disruptions in power transmission and communication networks.  The scientific outcomes are an improved understanding and new application of complex system dynamics to the engineering and analysis of stressed networks. Educational outcomes include the training of undergraduate and graduate students in a multidisciplinary team."

How this below-ground allocation of carbon responds to altered availability of resources such as nitrogen is fundamental to our understanding of ecosystem function. There are currently two competing theories: (1) increased N availability decreases C allocation to roots; and (2) increased N availability increases C allocation to roots. Understanding fine root production and mortality is at the heart of this conflict. The overall hypothesis of the PIs is that the type of root-mycorrhizal association is a dominant factor controlling carbon allocation to roots, root longevity and the response to root systems to changes in N availability. The PIs propose to directly and independently quantify root production and mortality, mycorrhizal community composition and abundance, root respiration, soil CO2 flux, and above-ground litterfall at four long-term study sites that represent a range of ecosystems typical of North America. The study sites capitalize on contrasts between ectomycorrhizal (EM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) conifers and hardwoods and represent a wide range of environmental conditions. Experimental additions of N are designed to address the issue of C allocation to roots at a scale that will resolve the controversy about how root growth and turnover at the ecosystem level responds to increasing N availability. By comparing and contrasting EM and AM dominated ecosystems under a variety of climatic and edaphic regimes, we will be able to make more universal statements about the factors controlling fine root turnover."

The collaborative project builds on the knowledge gained by the highly successful West Antarctic Ice Sheet program and is being jointly sponsored with NASA.  Recent observations indicate a significant ice loss, equivalent to 10% of the ongoing increase in sea-level rise, in this region. These changes are largest along the coast and propagate rapidly inland, indicating the critical impact of the ocean on ice sheet stability in the region.  While a broad range of remote sensing and ground-based instrumentation is available to characterize changes of the ice surface and internal structure (deformation, ice motion, melt) and the shape of the underlying sediment and rock bed, instrumentation has yet to be successfully deployed for observing boundary layer processes of the ocean cavity which underlies the floating ice shelf and where rapid melting is apparently occurring.  Innovative, mini ocean sensors that can be lowered through boreholes in the ice shelf (about 500 m thick) will be developed and deployed to automatically provide ocean profiling information over at least three years.  Their data will be transmitted through a conducting cable frozen in the borehole to the surface where it will be further transmitted via satellite to a laboratory in the US.  Geophysical and remote sensing methods (seismic, GPS, altimetry, stereo imaging, radar profiling) will be applied to map the geometry of the ice shelf, the shape of the sub ice-shelf cavity, the ice surface geometry and deformations within the glacial ice.  To integrate the seismic, glaciological and oceanographic observations, a new 3-dimensional coupled ice-ocean model is being developed which will be the first of its kind. NASA is supporting satellite based research and the deployment of a robotic-camera system to explore the environment in the ocean cavity underlying the ice shelf and NSF is supporting all other aspects of this study.  <br/> <br/>Broader impacts:  This project is motivated by the potential societal impacts of rapid sea level rise and should result in critically needed improvements in characterizing and predicting the behavior of coupled ocean-ice systems.  It is a contribution to the International Polar Year and was endorsed by the International Council for Science as a component of the ""Multidisciplinary Study of the Amundsen Sea Embayment"" proposal #258 of the honeycomb of endorsed IPY activities.  The research involves substantial international partnerships with the British Antarctic Survey and the University of Bristol in the UK.  The investigators will partner with the previously funded ""Polar Palooza"" education and outreach program in addition to undertaking a diverse set of outreach activities of their own.  Eight graduate students and one undergraduate as well as one post doc will be integrated into this research project.   <br/>"

This investigation is possible through the cooperation of colleagues across Europe and Africa. The goals are twofold. The first is historical, i.e., to provide additional information about this migration, whose effects on Africa's  linguistic, cultural, and genetic landscapes remain evident today. The second goal involves the environment which affects human adaptation and in turn is affected by humans. Minimal resources may have initially encouraged Bantu migration. Exploitation and over-exploitation of new lands followed, compelling continuing migration. After several millennia, the result was the modern distribution of sub-Saharan peoples.<br/><br/>The term ""Bantu"" identifies a language group spoken by most sub-Saharan Africans. However, early ethnographic studies revealed that Bantu-speakers were relative newcomers to this region. Linguistic and archaeological evidence sets their homeland in western Africa. Their ""expansion"" is believed to have begun 4,000-3,000 years ago. Most researchers accept this scenario. However, the fields of linguistics, archaeology, and genetics, which account for most Bantu research, often yield conflicting hypotheses concerning:  the scale of migration(s), number, routes, timing, and influence on the migrants and the region's original inhabitants. <br/><br/>An alternate approach is proposed to provide fresh insight, i.e., using the Arizona State University Dental Anthropology System (ASUDAS) to assess population variation. The ASUDAS returns analogous findings to genetic research, often yields superior results to other skeletal analyses, and is time-tested. Specifically, dental study holds a key advantage over traditional fields of Bantu research -- the ability to examine primary evidence. Samples will comprise remains of premodern individuals involved in or influenced by the migrations, along with their descendants who lived before recent detribalization and admixture. Other methods also have potential in this regard (e.g. aDNA); however, ASUDAS results can be obtained at a fraction of the cost, and the method is nondestructive. <br/><br/>Traits will first be recorded in proto-Bantu, Bantu, and non-Bantu samples (n>4,000 individuals.), and added to those already collected by Irish (n=845). These data will identify trait frequencies beyond that already known. Next, distance statistics will assess trait variation to estimate inter-sample relatedness. Results will be used to address region-specific hypotheses and formulate new ones. Finally, findings will be contrasted with published linguistic, archaeological, and genetic data to evaluate inter-method concordance. Beyond Bantu-specific issues, data analysis can also answer theoretical and methodological questions about human affinity and migration on a broader scale (incl. global). <br/><br/>Several broader benefits may be realized. Beyond training and experience for Dr. Irish's students, he is collaborating with African colleagues. He will also train African students, reach out to an interested lay audience -- including Africans who wish to better understand their past, and give public talks at African institutes. All findings will be communicated through peer-reviewed publications, and international and national fora. These results will add to the knowledge base on a vital historical issue, and contribute information on environment/human interaction."

Understanding subglacial hydrology, the persistence of life in extended isolation and the evolution and stability of subglacial habitats requires an integrated, interdisciplinary approach. The collaborative project, Minimally Invasive Direct Glacial Exploration (MIDGE) of the Biogeochemistry, Hydrology and Glaciology of Blood Falls, McMurdo Dry Valleys will integrate geophysical measurements, molecular microbial ecology and geochemical analyses to explore a unique Antarctic subglacial system known as Blood Falls. Blood Falls is a hypersaline, subglacial brine that supports an active microbial community. The subglacial brine is released from a crevasse at the surface of the Taylor Glacier providing an accessible portal into an Antarctic subglacial ecosystem. Recent geochemical and molecular analyses support a marine source for the salts and microorganisms in Blood Falls. The last time marine waters inundated this part of the McMurdo Dry Valleys was during the Late Tertiary, which suggests the brine is ancient. Still, no direct samples have been collected from the subglacial source to Blood Falls and little is known about the origin of this brine or the amount of time it has been sealed below Taylor Glacier. Radar profiles collected near Blood Falls delineate a possible fault in the subglacial substrate that may help explain the localized and episodic nature of brine release. However it remains unclear what triggers the episodic release of brine exclusively at the Blood Falls crevasse or the extent to which the brine is altered as it makes its way to the surface. <br/><br/>The MIDGE project aims to determine the mechanism of brine release at Blood Falls, evaluate changes in the geochemistry and the microbial community within the englacial conduit and assess if Blood Falls waters have a distinct impact on the thermal and stress state of Taylor Glacier, one of the most studied polar glaciers in Antarctica. The geophysical study of the glaciological structure and mechanism of brine release will use GPR, GPS, and a small passive seismic network. Together with international collaborators, the 'Ice Mole' team from FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences, Germany (funded by the German Aerospace Center, DLR), MIDGE will develop and deploy innovative, minimally invasive technologies for clean access and brine sample retrieval from deep within the Blood Falls drainage system. These technologies will allow for the collection of samples of the brine away from the surface (up to tens of meters) for geochemical analyses and microbial structure-function experiments. There is concern over the contamination of pristine subglacial environments from chemical and biological materials inherent in the drilling process; and MIDGE will provide data on the efficacy of thermoelectric probes for clean access and retrieval of representative subglacial samples. Antarctic subglacial environments provide an excellent opportunity for researching survivability and adaptability of microbial life and are potential terrestrial analogues for life habitats on icy planetary bodies. The MIDGE project offers a portable, versatile, clean alternative to hot water and mechanical drilling and will enable the exploration of subglacial hydrology and ecosystem function while making significant progress towards developing technologies for minimally invasive and clean sampling of icy systems."

Such legacy boreholes have been drilled into a range of seafloor geologic settings and many of these boreholes are deep enough that natural geothermal gradients have warmed the boreholes to temperatures in the range (60-200 degrees C). Within this temperature range reactions pathways between seawater and basalt change, affecting how the basaltic crust ages through the dissolution of primary minerals and the precipitation of different minerals as veins, for example. This combination of dissolution and precipitation changes the characteristics of the ocean crust that ultimately affects how the crust is subducted and the potential for large destructive earthquakes. This temperature range also spans the thermal limits of microbial life, based on experiments (122 degrees C), theoretical calculations (150 degrees C), and anecdotal evidence (180 degrees C). However the scientific drilling community currently lacks the ability to collect such warm pristine borehole fluids because electronics fail at such temperatures. This project will solve this sampling problem by first testing shape memory alloys, which are metal alloys that can change their shape and length at a specific temperature that is a function of the alloy composition and fabrication process. Then a water sampling system will be developed that utilizes the properties of shape memory alloys to trigger the collection of boreholes fluids. The first deployment of the newly fabricated system will occur in July 2019 when the scientific drilling program re-enters a legacy borehole that is ~200 degrees C at the base of the hole. The broader impacts of this project will provide the scientific community with a new sampling system for collecting borehole fluids at elevated temperatures. Such a sampling system is not limited to oceanic boreholes, but could be used within the thousands of existing continental boreholes. This new high temperature fluid sampling system will allow the community to explore new directions in understanding hydrothermal processes. Hydrothermal processes and the thermal limits of life are exciting topics that engage the public. More specifically the proposed work will include the development of a hands-on module for a week-long summer day camp (ssrovcamp.org) for rising 3-5th and 6-9th grade students and students involved in the undergraduate marine education program at Santa Clara University. Combined, over 300 students were engaged in one of these two programs in 2018.<br/><br/>The crux of this project is to design and fabricate a fluid sampling system for high temperature 60-200 degrees C borehole applications in oceanic and continental settings. The project will build on a Provisional Patent to design and fabricate standard titanium syringe-like fluid capture systems that are triggered by a novel mechanism. This mechanism will use shape memory alloys, given that such alloys change shape at a particular temperature. The sampling system will be modular in design to allow a suite of samples to be collected on a single lowering, each sampler collecting fluid at a specific temperature depending on the particular shape memory alloy that is used in that sampler. This system will be designed to be deployable from oceanic drilling vessels, continental drilling rigs, and submersibles/remotely operated vehicles (ROVs).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The resulting variability and disturbed conditions leads to harmful impacts on technological systems and even to risk to humans. Scientific imperatives and practical concerns converge in making space weather a rising priority for society and national planners. This collaborative project provides support for a consortium of four U.S. universities to continue the operations of a suite of High Frequency coherent-backscatter radars within the NSF Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS). This extension will enable a broad range of research across the space science community. The U.S. consortium functions as part of the international Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) which encompasses more than 35 radars distributed from mid through high to polar latitudes in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The leveraged benefits of the activities include student participation in the engineering and scientific tasks required to operate the network and to achieve the desired data products.<br/><br/>SuperDARN is well known for producing maps of the large-scale circulation of ionospheric plasma that can be compared in terms of scientific significance and practical utility to maps of winds and pressure systems in tropospheric weather. The radars observe a wide range of effects in the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere thermosphere system that bear directly on understanding and modeling space weather events. The award will continue a program of continued observations while also achieving significant refurbishment of eleven U.S. radars located in North America and add the operations of two new radars in Iceland that are being built on separate support. It will also enable, with partial funding and by virtue of the availability of data, a broad range of research by the U.S. SuperDARN scientists on such new themes as convection in the inner magnetosphere, subauroral ionospheric convection, and solar flare impacts on the ionosphere. As a consequence of this award, the U.S. research community will be supplied with data from the entire set of SuperDARN radars and assisted in the application of SuperDARN data and data products. The award will provide new data products to the community include mapping of ionospheric plasma convection at much improved spatial resolution and techniques for applying machine learning to geospace datasets.

This map of ion and electron energy deposition would be combined with the convection pattern observed by the SuperDARN radar network to provide a relatively complete dynamic picture of the ionospheric signatures of dayside magnetospheric processes. Previous studies have indicated a strong relationship between the discrete aurora and the magnetospheric boundary layer processes associated with the transfer of energy from the solar wind to the ionosphere. Auroral hydrogen emission Doppler spectral profiles obtained in the magnetic zenith at Longyearbyen, Svalbard have been shown to be a direct measure of the incoming ion energy, which is correlated with changes in the interplanetary magnetic field. The observations will be made by aiming two large-aperture spectrometers in different directions (initially in the zenith) under the dayside aurora at Longyearbyen and Ny Aalesund, Svalbard to measure the H emission spectral profile simultaneously in different regions of the ionospheric signature of a merging event at the magnetopause. From these spectra, and other supporting optical data, the investigators will deduce the dispersion of ion and electron energy in the ionospheric region of the magnetospheric cusp. From this and the associated observed convection pattern, they will deduce the location and the extent of a merging event on the dayside magnetopause. Governed by Norway, Svalbard is unique in its relation to international scientific investigations of polar phenomena. Students and investigators from many countries carry out research throughout the year. Auroral research is generally restricted to the months around the solstice when it is dark enough to carry out observations of the daytime aurora unique in the northern hemisphere. During each observing season, at least one public popular science lecture is given in Longyearbyen. Visits by the local school classes occur frequently, and the observatory is used as a training laboratory by the local University Courses on Svalbard (UNIS). Svalbard is also the center of an NSF/Polar Programs program of cooperative research between Norway and the US. Advances in the study of Space Weather have led to more accurate descriptions of the production of disturbances in the solar wind due to events on the Sun. Indeed, satellites upwind of Earth continuously observe these changes, but scientists are at a loss to predict, with any accuracy, the extent of these disturbances on the ionosphere. To do so would allow the preparation of contingency plans for radio communications blackouts, electric power grid failures, and satellite subsystem demise. The two most important unknowns in the relationship between the solar wind and the Earth's ionosphere are the magnetospheric processes involved in the transfer of solar wind power to the ionosphere from the dayside magnetopause and the nightside magnetospheric tail."

Radars in the international SuperDARN network measure important properties of Earth's ionosphere, including electric fields, plasma structures, and acoustic gravity waves.  Progress in the study of Earth's near-space environment increasingly relies on the availability of these critical measurements on global scales.  The interest in SuperDARN data products has spurred the recent development of a pair of polar cap radars by Canadian colleagues, extending SuperDARN capabilities to the highest latitudes.  This MSI project, which is a collaborative effort involving four institutions, will result in eight new radars distributed over four sites situated along an arc extending from the Azores through the central United States to the Aleutian Island chain.  The new radars will provide unprecedented views of the dynamics of the subauroral ionosphere and inner magnetosphere.  The feasibility of such measurements at middle latitudes has been demonstrated with the deployments of single, isolated SuperDARN radars in the eastern United States (Wallops Island, Blackstone) and in Japan (Hokkaido).  The existing radars will be operationally folded into the MSI chain.  The realization of this large-scale and long-term observational capability will furnish the space physics community with new infrastructure and a valuable tool for engaging students in cutting-edge research.  SuperDARN data collected from high latitudes are used by space scientists all over the world.  The existing radar network was developed incrementally over 15 years with the steady addition of international partners.  This project will initiate the acquisition of comparable infrastructure at mid-latitudes thereby taking advantage of recent developments at polar latitudes and the existing high-latitude SuperDARN network to provide expanded coverage of effects in the magnetosphere, ionosphere, and neutral atmosphere.  The protocols and distribution methods currently used for SuperDARN data and data products will be utilized to ensure the same ease of access to data.  As occurred with high latitude SuperDARN, international partners are simultaneously seeking funds to build complementary radars in Europe and Asia.  The participants in this project are all associated with institutions of higher learning and view the infrastructure as both a teaching and research investment.  Data from the high-latitude SuperDARN radars have contributed to numerous advanced degrees and the mid-latitude extension will furnish many more opportunities.  Students at the collaborating institutions will be heavily engaged in the work of this project both at their home institutions and at the individual radar sites.  Measurements provided by the infrastructure will enable transformational science and support research across a broad range of topics in the physics of the magnetosphere, ionosphere, and upper atmosphere.  At the same time, this effort will: (1) provide the research community with extensive mid-latitude ionospheric and atmospheric datasets; (2) provide large-scale context for ongoing and future spacecraft and rocket missions; (3) generate new research possibilities in space science for students; (4) provide opportunities for students at U.S. universities to gain hands-on experience with radar technology and in the management of a major scientific collaboration.  All data and data products will be made freely available through the SuperDARN website."

The project will use observational analysis and modeling experiments to investigate the links between arctic sea ice trends and changes to seasonal snow cover. The autumn snow cover is of particular interest due to its persistent increases over the last two decades despite the robust warming trend and its connection to stratosphere-troposphere coupling and hemispheric variability in the subsequent winter season and that while fall snow cover has been increasing, spring snow cover has been decreasing. This work will explore the links to sea ice in terms of changes to moisture transport, synoptic activity, and soil moisture and the links to the large scale atmospheric dynamics in terms of changes to the timing and occurrence of stratosphere-troposphere coupling events. This will make it possible to evaluate better the feedback mechanisms associated with snow cover and the atmosphere, and should lead to a quantitative assessment of future trends in the Arctic. The likely influence of snow and ice cover on future global temperature trends highlights the importance of developing a fundamental understanding of regional surface-atmosphere water and energy exchange dynamics of the arctic regions. Observed data will include both remote sensing and station observations (snow cover extent of CPC/Rutgers University, snow depth, humidity and temperature data from the Russian Hydrometeorological network, and corrected precipitation) and data from NCEP/NCAR and ECMWF reanalyses. This work should result in an improved understanding of arctic climate feedback mechanisms, their association with observed past and modeled future trends, and their influence on weather and climate on a hemispheric scale."

The earthquakes, the 15 November 2006 event with the thrust-faulting mechanism and the 13 January 2007 event with the extensional mechanism, had magnitudes 8.3 and 8.1, respectively. They make one of the largest earthquake doublets to occur in the era of space geodesy. The region of the central Kurils had not experienced a single great earthquake since 1915 despite a rapid plate convergence rate. In contrast, the segments to the north (Kamchatka) and south (the southern Kurils and Hokkaido) each had several great earthquakes within the last century. The Kuril subduction zone was never studied using space geodesy before 2006, when the research team of this project installed continuous GPS stations over the whole Kuril arc, several months before both great earthquakes in the central Kurils. In 2007, additional GPS stations were installed on the Kuril Islands accessible only by ship. In total, there are now seven functioning continuous stations and several sites measured by campaign surveys. The Kuril GPS network allowed the scientists to capture static coseismic offsets and rapid postseismic deformation at many sites, and to develop a preliminary model of coseismic slip distribution in earthquake ruptures. The current phase of the project enables a detailed study of the postseismic process following the 2006-2007 earthquakes. The focus of this phase is on acquiring and investigating irreplaceable data on the early postseismic transient signal. The project has the following goals: (1) develop improved coseismic slip models for the 2006-2007 events consistent with all available geodetic and seismic information; (2) develop a consistent model of postseismic deformation including both afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation, and compare to other events. The fundamental problems addressed here are: How long-lived is the postseismic deformation following great 2006-2007 Kuril earthquakes, and how does it compare with events at other subduction zones? Are postseismic models for the Kuril earthquake doublet consistent with the apparent lack of any long-lived postseismic deformation from the 1952 southern Kamchatka earthquake with a magnitude >9? The answers to these questions will help to make a step forward in understanding of the seismic cycle at subduction zones. The scientific results will directly contribute to earthquake hazard assessments by improving the accuracy of earthquake scenarios and probabilities for the Kuril subduction zone.

Their characteristics include the complete absence of the circulating oxygen-binding protein, hemoglobin (Hb) within the Channichthyid (Icefish) family of notothenioids. Moreover, some species within the 16 members of this family have also lost the ability to express the oxygen-binding and storage protein, myoglobin (Mb) in cardiac muscle.  Our previous work has determined that the loss of Hb and/or Mb is correlated with significant increases in densities of mitochondria within oxidative tissues, and extensive remodeling of these vital organelles. To date, nothing is known about how modifications in mitochondrial architecture of icefishes affect organelle function, or more importantly, how they affect organismal-level physiology. Most critical for Antarctic fishes is that mitochondrial characteristics have been linked to how well ectotherms can withstand increases in temperature. <br/><br/>This collaborative research project will address the hypothesis that the unusual mitochondrial architecture of Antarctic Channichthyids has led to changes in function that impact their ability to withstand elevations in temperature. Specifically, the research will (1) determine if the unusual mitochondrial architecture of icefishes affects function and contributes to organismal thermal sensitivity, (2) identify differences in organismal thermal tolerance between red- and white- blooded notothenioids, (3) identify molecular mechanisms regulating changes in mitochondrial structure in icefishes. The results may establish channichthyid icefishes as a sentinel taxon for signaling the impact of global warming on the Southern Ocean. Broad impacts of this project will be realized by participation of high school biology teachers in field work through cooperation with the ARMADA project at the University of Rhode Island, as well as graduate education. <br/>"

This eruption is very well documented, and it occurred at the most dangerous of the world's Decade Volcanoes where at least 600,000 people live within 10 km of the crater. The sustained explosive eruptions, which characterize Vesuvius' history, are highly destructive events where stable eruption plumes give way to column collapse, and/or phreatomagmatism. In this context, the 79AD eruption can be considered as a ""case study"" or ""field laboratory"" for understanding such complex changes in eruption processes. Although much is known about the physical characteristics and chemistry of its deposits, many questions remain regarding the eruptions themselves:<br/>1. What was the cause of sudden early column collapse (prior to the onset of phreatomagmatism),<br/>which generated the first pyroclastic density currents (PDCs), responsible for destruction and deaths at Herculaneum and surrounding areas?<br/>2. What were the conditions of ascent and vesiculation of magma during the late, phreatomagmatic phase of the eruptions characterized by highly unstable plumes?<br/>3. What  influence did microlites in these melts, mainly leucites, have on eruption dynamics, crystallization kinetics and magma rheology?<br/>Answers to these questions will provide a more complete understanding of complex changes in eruption dynamics and style. Data sets for vesicle and microlite size, density and shape will be determined and compared with experimental data to constrain timing and rates of leucite crystallization and vesicle formation. Experiments on leucite crystallization will be conducted at UAF where studies are already underway on vesicle development [EAR 0511070]).<br/><br/>Broader impacts: By focusing on this well-constrained and famous historical eruption, the proposed work should have broad interest to the public and application to other volcanological investigations.

Results will be incorporated into teaching materials for Hawaiian and Alaskan students, and the budget includes funds to ensure the direct involvement of students in the research. Further outreach will be achieved through an educational web-page which uses the 79AD example to demonstrate geological processes through analogy with this fascinating and famous eruption to high school students. Concurrently, results will be incorporated into education and hazard communication to officials of the Italian Civil Defense plan for Vesuvius."

Heard Island is a small (367 km 2 ) subantarctic island which consists of a 2700 m high composite volcano that is glacierized on all sides..  The objective of the work is to determine the current mass balance, geometry and flow regime of Brown Glacier on Heard Island in the Southern Indian Ocean.  The work will help to establish a baseline profile of Heard Island glaciers by measuring some basic glaciological parameters (mass balance, flow velocity, ice thickness).  This will help relate the observed glacier changes to climate, and thus provide an important indicator of climate change in one of the most remote and least visited places on the planet.  The proposed work provides an excellent opportunity for U.S. involvement in an area where it would be nearly impossible to operate without local collaboration.  The intellectual merit of this study is that it adds to observations of climate change in a region of the world that is very difficult to access, and where few data have been collected. Heard Island is one of only few landmasses at this latitude, and its elevation range makes it a prime candidate for glacier study.  Documenting glacier change fills an important gap in the picture of global climate change.  The broader impacts of this work are that this is a collaborative project with the Australian Antarctic Division who will provide the logistics and some personnel. The work will be part of a Ph.D. thesis at the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Australia and will thus contribute to the education of a young scientist. The Heard Island field team includes geologists, glaciologists, and plant and wildlife biologists, studying this unique system. Much of the work is interdisciplinary, such as the study of plant re-colonization after glacial retreat. Heard Island is a World Heritage site, and it is believed that no human-introduced plant or animal life exists on the island. The Australian Antarctic Division has a long history of successful collaboration with U.S. investigators and is keen on maintaining that. It concentrates its work in and around the eastern part of the Antarctic continent, and therefore complements the U.S. work on the western part of Antarctica. The results of this work will be published in peer-reviewed journals. The investigator has also given lectures to the general public and provided feedback to journalists on glacier issues, and will continue to do so in the future."

A significant contribution during the past decades has been from mountain glaciers, but the contribution from the Greenland Ice Sheet is anticipated to become dominant in the near future.  This contribution is delivered to the ocean as both meltwater and icebergs that melt in the fjords and coastal ocean around Greenland.  These contributions vary spatially.  The proposed work will develop a model of Greenland's contribution to sea level rise, constrain the model using observed data, and estimate contributions based on scenarios of future climate.<br/><br/>The project will contribute to STEM workforce development by providing support for the training of two graduate students.  It will also provide support for a beginning investigator during the formative years of his career.  It will contribute to the community resources by maintaining and enhancing the open source Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) code for community use.<br/><br/>Four possible controls on outlet glacier systems dynamics have been identified: <br/>1) Warming subsurface ocean water and/or increased subglacial runoff may increase submarine ice melting at the glacier-fjord interface;<br/>2) Rigid sea ice and ice mélange (a mixture of sea ice and icebergs) may suppress calving, allowing for terminus advance; <br/>3) The terminus position relative to subglacial topography (e.g., over-deepenings or sills) influences rates of retreat; and <br/>4) Changes in the resistive stress caused by contact with the fjord walls and/or glacier bed can lead to terminus advance, retreat, and/or thinning.<br/>Previous simulations of ice sheet contributions to sea level rise have been limited by the insufficient spatial resolution of models and observational data, which prevented whole-ice sheet simulations to faithfully capture outlet glacier flow. Results to date are either obtained from regional models or from highly idealized flow line models that were upscaled to ice-sheet scale. Recent advances in ice sheet modeling, and the availability of high-resolution subglacial topography, now allow one to resolve individual outlet glacier flow in ice sheet-wide simulations. This project will use the framework of the open-source Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM), uni-directionally coupled to new high-resolution hindcasts of the atmosphere and ocean. This will provide a test bed for assessing, on a glacier-by-glacier basis: <br/>1) what is the relative present-day influence of the four controls on outlet glacier flow and ice discharge; <br/>2) what is the potential for a substantial increase in 21st century ice discharge; <br/>3) what conditions would precipitate large changes (e.g., spatio-temporal distribution of ocean warming, enhanced surface runoff); and <br/>4) what observations are required in support of a Greenland Ice Sheet Ocean Observing System to capture the forcing or onset of large changes? <br/>Comparison to available remotely-sensed and in-situ observations, including, but not limited to, time-series of surface velocities, surface elevation, and mass changes will serve as metrics of success. Simulations of the 21st century evolution of the Greenland Ice Sheet will then be performed, forced by available atmosphere-ocean projections, to provide realistic estimates of future ice discharge."

Polar ice core records reveal dynamic increases in atmospheric methane concentrations during this period, but the source of this methane remains the subject of much debate. This study will measure the isotopic values of methane emissions from field samples to provide region-specific estimates of methane emissions from coastal wetlands, peatlands, proglacial lakes, and other lake types (e.g. thermokarst and post-glacial lakes) since the last deglaciation for comparisons with ice core records. This research will reconstruct the past methane emissions from flooded deglacial land areas (potentially representing unknown northern sources of increased atmospheric methane concentrations during these periods) and assess their role in contributing to the abrupt methane increases observed in in polar ice core records. Knowledge of past methane emissions from newly inundated land areas flooded by sea level rise, wetland expansion, permafrost thaw, and associated lake formation will provide an improved understanding of global climate feedbacks that will likely accelerate in the region. This knowledge is critical to answering larger societal questions about the role of northern systems in global environmental change and our ability to understand the cascade of effects from sea level rise and coastal flooding.<br/><br/>This research uses comprehensive paleoecological records of (a) northern continental shelf areas and coastal wetlands inundated by rapid deglacial sea-level rise (SLR) and (b) proglacial lake areas inundated by glacier and ice-sheet melt to document their past contributions to abrupt increases in atmospheric methane concentrations. The research goals are to: (1) synthesize new and existing shelf, coastal wetland, regional SLR curves, and proglacial-lake initiation data to reconstruct newly inundated areas poleward of 30? N; (2) estimate past methane flux from inundated northern coastal regions as they evolved from methane-consuming forest and grassland areas to higher emitting mudflats, marshes, and freshwater wetlands by integrating new and existing methane fluxes into an empirical model; (3) analyze new and existing methane fluxes from proglacial lakes of different sizes, ages and geographies to build an empirical model for reconstructing proglacial lake emissions from 18 ka to present (with an emphasis on the deglacial period,18-8 ka); (4) use stable isotopes (&#8706;13C, &#8706;D) of methane and 14C dating to constrain the magnitude and timing of methane flux from these newly flooded land areas; and (5) compare our reconstructions of past methane emissions and isotope fluxes from inundated shelves, coastal wetlands, and proglacial lakes with global atmospheric methane constraints based on recent, higher resolution data of methane isotopes (&#8706;13C, &#8706;D, 14C) from Greenland and Antarctic ice cores using atmospheric box modeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These cores record an extraordinary sequence of impact and post-impact events. This project will investigate these unique cores further to understand the local and global effects of the only impact conclusively linked to a mass extinction event. This research is part of a larger international effort, including ~40 scientists from 14 countries, and also supports education and mentoring at the graduate and post-graduate level. Project researchers will continue to engage in outreach and education through media interviews, museum displays, and other activities to highlight the research to the general public.  <br/><br/>The recent IODP-ICDP drilling expedition at Chicxulub recovered the first-ever samples of an unequivocal peak ring. A peak ring is a discontinuous ring of mountains observed within the central basin of all large impact craters on rocky planets.

Tree data structures, and the algorithms used to work on these structures, are heavily used in these applications because they help to make these applications run much faster on supercomputers. However, implementing tree-based algorithms can require a significant effort, particularly on modern highly parallel computers.  This project will create ParaTreet, a software toolkit for parallel trees, that will enable rapid development of such applications.  Details of the parallel aspects will be hidden from the programmer, who will be able to quickly evaluate the relative merits of different trees and algorithms even when applied to large datasets and very computation-intensive applications. The combination of such an abstract and extensible framework with a portable adaptive runtime system will allow scientists to effectively use parallel hardware ranging from small clusters to petascale-class machines, for a wide variety of tree-based applications. This project will demonstrate the feasibility of such an approach as well as generate evidence of community adoption of this technology. If successful, this project will enable NSF-supported researchers to solve science problems faster as well as to tackle more complex problems, thus serving NSF's science mission.<br/><br/><br/>This project builds upon an existing collaboration on Computational Astronomy and the resultant software base in the ChaNGa (Charm N-body GrAvity solver) code. ChaNGa is a software package that performs collisionless N-body simulations, and can perform cosmological simulations with periodic boundary conditions in co-moving coordinates or simulations of isolated stellar systems. This project will extend ChaNGa with a parallel tree toolkit called ParaTreet and associated applications, that will allow scientists to effectively utilize small clusters as well as very large supercomputers for parallel tree-based calculations.  The key data structure in ParaTreet is an asynchronous software-based tree data cache, which maintains a writeback local copy of remote tree data. We plan to support a variety of spatial decomposition methods and the associated trees, including Oct-trees, KD-trees, inside-outside trees, ball trees, R-trees, and their combinations. Different trees are useful in different application circumstances, and the software will allow their relative merits to be evaluated with relative ease. The framework will support a variety of parallel work decomposition methods, including those based on space filling curves, and support dynamic rearrangement of parallel work at runtime. The algorithms supported will range from Barnes-Hut with various multipole expansions, data clustering, collision detection, surface reconstruction, ray intersection, etc. The software includes a collection of dynamic load balancing strategies in the Charm++ framework that can be tuned for specific problem structures.

The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, and integrates the co-production of knowledge. This award fulfills part of that aim.<br/><br/>Permafrost is ground that remains frozen for at least two consecutive years. It occurs under approximately one fourth of the northern hemisphere's land surface. In the far north, the permafrost is continuous across the landscape and contains large amounts of ice in its upper few meters. Thawing of permafrost has been observed at several locations across the Arctic in recent decades, yet the complete extent of permafrost degradation is not yet described. This is because it is difficult to directly measure permafrost. However, the presence and health of permafrost can be inferred from characteristic ground surface features. For example, permafrost can be detected from detailed satellite images through the presence of 30-meter-wide ice-wedge polygons. It is important to detect areas with thawing permafrost to identify challenges for infrastructure that depend on a foundation of solid ground. This project is developing the Permafrost Discovery Gateway, an online platform that makes permafrost information more accessible and discoverable by the public. The public includes industry, non-profit organizations, and people living and working in the Arctic. Future workforce development includes the training of graduate students and postdocs in remote sensing technology. Five early career researchers are the lead investigators. The K-12 education community are receiving virtual resources to help them interact with the Permafrost Discovery Gateway. In addition, a collaborative art exhibition, an interactive digital story, and an online Earth as Art gallery are displaying Arctic landscapes to the general public. These tools enable diverse peoples of different technical backgrounds to interact with permafrost knowledge across the entire Arctic. This project informs the economy, security, and resilience of the U.S., the larger region, and the globe with respect to Arctic change. <br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to develop supporting cyberinfrastructure to harness information from high-resolution satellite imagery. This approach is advancing the understanding of permafrost degradation across the entire Arctic. This project is: (1) utilizing existing Big Imagery, (2) refining and developing new automated remote sensing classification tools based on machine and deep learning techniques, (3) applying the mapping tools to Arctic satellite imagery, (4) making permafrost map products and tools publicly accessible, and (5) enabling discovery through visualization and analysis tools designed with users of the Permafrost Discovery Gateway. The project is producing a cyberinfrastructure framework that also includes existing Arctic map products. This framework, along with an engaged user community, is allowing researchers to better quantify the spatial extent of permafrost degradation across the Arctic. Potential controls (weather, topography, vegetation, soil properties) on permafrost degradation are also being evaluated. The Permafrost Discovery Gateway helps ensure information access to the broader research community and encourage new partnerships around knowledge of Arctic permafrost.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A shift in vegetation is one of the most important changes an ecosystem can experience, because it can alter exchanges of energy (originating from sunlight), water, and elements such as carbon and nitrogen, among air, plants, and soil. In the Arctic, a widespread shift from tundra to shrub-dominated vegetation appears to be occurring. This research project will discern whether, through complex interactions, this transition to shrublands in the Arctic is likely to result in the release of more carbon into the air (as either carbon dioxide or methane, which are both greenhouse gases). Vast amounts of carbon are stored in Arctic and northern soils, so reduced carbon storage in the Arctic may affect weather and climate in other parts of the world. <br/><br/>This project will assess the contributions of different shrub feedbacks to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Snow depth will be manipulated with existing snow fences across a natural gradient of shrub density and height, and a new snowfence experiment will be established in alders. Shrub-induced changes in soil C over the longer term in one ecosystem will be examined in an 18-year-old species removal experiment. Shrub growth, primary production, and biomass will be measured. Long-term effects of added snow on ecosystem N partitioning and shrub N uptake will be measured in a 15N tracer experiment. N fixation will be measured in alder populations and moss communities associated with shrubs. The relative strengths of different shrub feedbacks to N availability and uptake by vegetation will be evaluated. This project will improve prediction of the consequences of shrub expansion in the Arctic, and its potential impacts on regional and global climate.

Many of these water bodies traditionally freeze solid during the winter, preserving sub-lake permafrost and keeping soil carbon stocks immobile at depth.  Slightly deeper lakes maintain some liquid water beneath floating ice, causing deep thaw zones in otherwise continuous permafrost.  Evidence suggests that thinner ice growth in response to warmer, snowier winters is pushing many bedfast ice lakes to floating ice regimes.  If such a regime shift becomes pervasive across lake-rich landscapes, resulting permafrost thaw and enhanced moisture and heat flux could generate positive feedbacks, further amplifying this regime change. <br/><br/>This project examines the extent and dynamics of bedfast and floating ice lakes in relation to hypothesized interactions and feedback with permafrost and climate.  A combination of remote sensing, field monitoring and geophysical measurements, experiments and physical models are used to isolate processes, quantify interactions and project changes.  Project findings will be relevant locally for native village subsistence and for water supply to the petroleum industry, and globally for scientists studying permafrost thaw and Arctic climate change."

Additionally, occurrences of tall shrubs could be used as a readily measured proxy for subsurface properties both across space and time using remote sensing. If our observations hold true in other stream environments, the information has the potential to provide novel hydrological, permafrost, and biological process insights to complement the extensive literature on increasing Arctic shrub cover.

This team will measure additional streams with differing gradients, bed morphologies, and substrates to test the statistical significance of their preliminary observation that tall shrubs indicate losing streams, and to expand measurements to include shrub height, cover, biomass, Leaf Area Index (LAI), permafrost, and soil microbial communities. <br/><br/>The award will support three early career researchers to gather background data to enable them to explore a potentially transformative idea to set the foundation to examine the processes linking shrubs, permafrost, hydrology and microbiology. The results of this work would be disseminated directly to land management and private organizations."

The Permafrost Coastal Systems Network (PerCS-Net) project will fill fundamental knowledge gaps in science, engineering, and societal issues associated with permafrost-affected coasts in the Arctic by linking over ten existing national and international networks. PerCS-Net will position our nation alongside international collaborators to empower new research communities, diversify Arctic researchers, engage in the co-production of knowledge, and promote long-lasting team science required to face the known and emerging challenges of the changing Arctic. This network of networks will develop internationally recognized protocols for quantifying and synthesizing information on the impacts occurring in coastal permafrost systems. It will also provide a framework to assess risks to local and global economies and to transfer knowledge that will lead to adaptation strategies across Arctic regions. PerCS-Net will promote synergy across networks to foster the next generation of students, postdoctoral scholars, and early-career researchers charged with identifying potential solutions to changes occurring in the Arctic system. <br/><br/>There is no place more representative of the challenges faced at the intersection of natural, social, and built systems than the Arctic. PerCS-Net will develop a transdisciplinary umbrella network to synergize existing datasets, expand observations in space and time, integrate in-situ sensing techniques, coordinate goals among networks, and engage in synthesis efforts. The new knowledge will inform intergovernmental agencies as well as international research and outreach programs to make science-based decisions and policies in adapting to permafrost coastal system dynamics. Network activities include annual in-person meetings at national and international venues, monthly webinar meetings, outreach in Arctic coastal communities, synthesis publications, and student and early-career researcher personnel exchanges. Expected outcomes of PerCS-Net will integrate into a framework for transformative knowledge sharing from individuals and organizations cooperating across political, cultural, and disciplinary borders to address critical science, engineering, and social issues in response to permafrost coastal systems in the changing Arctic. <br/><br/>The Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations (AccelNet) program is designed to accelerate the process of scientific discovery and prepare the next generation of U.S. researchers for multiteam international collaborations.

The ionosphere is generally broken out by layers, defined according to the wavelengths of the radiation most commonly absorbed. The E-region extends from 90-150 km and is ionized through X-ray and ultraviolet radiation. The F-region (150-600 km) is ionized by extreme ultraviolet radiation. Although waves and disturbances (""structuring"") occur throughout the ionospheric medium (""plasma""), studies often focus on; either the E or F layer owing in part to limitations of experimental and theoretical; techniques employed. As a result, development of a unified view of ionospheric plasma structuring processes remains incomplete. This proposal will fill this gap by (1) developing a unified plasma instability theory applicable in the broad range of altitudes including the previously unexplored transitional valley region between the E and F region peaks and (2) observing the valley region with a radar that routinely receives returns from a broad range of altitudes. The proposed research leverages NSF assets and knowledge synthesis to contribute fundamentally to the theory of plasma instability and structuring. This knowledge is relevant to the communication and navigation industries, and therefore to society. The integrated theory will be incorporated into UAF plasma physics classes, that currently rely primarily on original journal publications rather than teaching modules. The proposal will also fund a new Ph.D. student.<br/><br/>The proposed research will address the fundamental question of what combination of destabilizing and stabilizing factors results in the plasma perturbations growing in amplitude and producing ionospheric structures. The actual proposal activity consists of three interconnected projects: 1. Development a unified theory of ionospheric plasma instabilities including thermal, inertial, and gradient effects for arbitrary altitude and propagation; 2. Determination of the critical gradient length required to destabilize plasma in the non-isothermal case for arbitrary altitude; 3. Analysis of SuperDARN and ISR data to investigate small-scale irregularity occurrence in the previously unexplored transitional ""valley"" region (~150 km).

The ionosphere is an ionized layer in the upper atmosphere (at and above ~110-km altitude) where electrical currents can flow in response to the coupling between the Earth's magnetosphere and solar wind plasma flow in the Earth's neighborhood (geospace). Many geospace phenomena are caused by solar flares and coronal mass ejections that have their effects transmitted to ionospheric layers, which are especially strong in the polar regions. The ionospheric plasma convection (that carries ionospheric currents) becomes strong during geomagnetic storms when it moves as a whole over both polar caps from dayside to nightside and then returns to the dayside via respective auroral zones. Polar ionospheres are also electrically connected via the Earth's magnetic field lines in conjugate points. The ionospheric connection plays a very important role in transporting currents and electric fields between the magnetopause and both polar regions, but these processes are still insufficiently studied. <br/><br/>The large network of SuperDARN radars already observe ionospheric convection in the northern and southern polar regions on a regular basis. Data from these radars are used to study responses of ionospheric convection to solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field changes, the relation of central polar cap convection to that of the cusp and midnight regions, and to the state of the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system. The NSF-funded Antarctic SuperDARN radars at McMurdo and South Pole contribute to the studies such as relationships between wave structures observed in the solar wind and respective responses in the polar caps, motion of plasma density structures, ion-neutral coupling, and thermospheric winds. This research effort will continue developing the NSF-funded radars, help addressing fundamental questions of the Geospace research that have not yet thoroughly examined."

The project's research will address a fundamental question of why E-region echoes from the polar cap are observed at all by the McMurdo radar. These investigations will include further examination of the previously found auroral echoes with unusual properties, e.g., velocities greatly exceeding nominal ion-acoustic speed and independent of the plasma flow angle. They will also evaluate the extent of magnetic conjugacy of the E-region radar aurora and establish the relationship between E-region irregularities and plasma drift velocities.

Implications are significant for strategic and tactical military planning; regional, and perhaps global, climate; northern ecosystems and cultures; and economic interests. Climate models qualitatively agree that these changes will persist. Projections of when specific benchmarks, such as an ice-free summer Arctic Ocean, will be reached vary by several decades. Reducing uncertainty in Arctic change projections is an important task. This project identifies tides and near-inertial (NI) waves, with periods of approximately 12 hours, as the major components of Arctic ocean velocity fields, mixing rates and ice dynamics that are not presently represented in global coupled climate models. The project will provide the Arctic community with a database of time-dependent tidal and NI energy in select current meter records. Also, it will provide a carefully-validated, high-resolution, fully-forced Arctic coupled ocean/sea-ice model (OIM) for quantifying the effects of high-frequency (HF) processes on seasonal and longer-term variability of the Arctic Ocean and its ice pack. The project will contribute to STEM workforce development through support for the training of a post-doctoral associate and a graduate student, and through support for two early-career scientists. K-12 outreach will be enabled through in-person and webinar programs at schools in AK, TX, WA and OR. A public-friendly video with visualization of model results will be prepared and distributed to schools and other communities including coastal Alaskan villages, and highlighted on the project website.<br/><br/>Motivated by observations of strong HF ocean currents and ice drift velocities that are very sensitive to<br/>changes in sea-ice state, sparse measurements of HF time series of ocean mixing and ice deformation,<br/>and coarse-grid models with parameterized tide forcing, this project tests the following hypothesis: ""Energetic, HF processes, including tides and wind-generated NI waves, are critical contributors to the seasonal cycle and longer-term trends of the Arctic's 3-D hydrography and circulation, sea-ice characteristics, and exchanges of heat, freshwater and momentum between the atmosphere, ocean and sea-ice."" The program's specific goals are to map the time-dependent distribution of HF energy in the ocean and ice throughout the Arctic; assess the role of HF processes in the Arctic ice and upper ocean; develop understanding of the HF processes coupling the sea ice, ocean, and atmosphere; and quantify the effect of HF processes on seasonal cycles and longer-term trends. Taking advantage of rapidly growing databases for ocean and sea-ice velocities, and improvements in resolution and physical realism of OIMs, it integrates analyses of tidal and NI signals in select Arctic ocean moorings and sea-ice drift data, validation of a high resolution (~2 km x 106 vertical levels) pan-Arctic OIM with full atmospheric and tidal forcing, and comparison of a suite of model simulations with different forcing to identify dominant HF processes. Simulations with simplified forcing (e.g., removing tides and low-pass filtering the winds to reduce NI forcing) will identify key factors involved in HF influence on ocean and sea-ice state on seasonal and longer time scales. Focus areas include the effect of HF processes on ice formation and dispersion of river freshwater and heat fluxes in shelf seas, on mixing of Atlantic- and Pacific-sourced waters along the Arctic continental slopes, on feedbacks between ocean and sea-ice HF processes, and on the seasonal cycle of atmospheric heat exchange with the ocean and sea ice."

The Earth is protected from the direct impact of the solar wind by its magnetic field that extends out to high altitudes and causes the solar wind to be deflected around it. When the Earth?s magnetic field becomes connected to the Sun's magnetic field through a process called magnetic merging, some of the solar wind energy enters near-Earth space.  The interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere accelerates plasma particles to energies high enough to threaten spacecraft electronics and astronaut health, and in addition, creates mega-ampere electric currents in the upper atmosphere that can disrupt power grids on the Earth's surface.  To predict space weather and thus provide some warning to implement mediation strategies, it is important to understand the conditions in the solar wind that actually hit the magnetosphere.  Complications arise because to get sufficient lead-time for the prediction to be of value, the solar wind must be measured upstream of the Earth.  However, this undisturbed solar wind is not what eventually triggers the space storming.  Instead the solar wind is modified as it forms a bow shock and a layer of shocked and heated plasma (called the magnetosheath) before arriving at the magnetosphere.  As a result, it is important to be able to relate observations of the undisturbed solar wind far upstream of the Earth with the solar wind that actually arrives and then to the space storm that is produced.  The results of this study will be used for graduate and undergraduate education purposes, and will be disseminated widely.  Taking a longer-range perspective, a better understanding of the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction will likely result in improvements to space weather forecasting of value to society and will be relevant to the study of planetary and astrophysical plasma environments.   Related space weather topics will be featured in public outreach activities in various venues.  A partnership with the Public Information and Outreach Education Office at the Geophysical Institute will significantly increase the scope of the outreach activities beyond the proposing team alone.<br/><br/>Observations indicate that a population of solar wind ions reflects from the bow shock, travels back toward the Sun and interacts non-linearly with the incoming solar wind producing a variety of transient features (i.e., hot flow anomalies, foreshock cavitons, and density holes) upstream of the bow shock.   Though these transients have been observed for decades, the underlying physical mechanisms that produce them, how they modify the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction, and the types of signatures that result within near-Earth space are still not understood. Since the interaction of the solar wind with the magnetosphere produces the transients and the transients feed back to modify the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction, these features must be studies as a connected system in order to identify the underlying mechanisms.   The present work will use observations to identify the various types of solar wind transients, and the conditions under which they are produced, and then use simulations to identify the underlying physical mechanisms. This holistic approach is expected to produce important advances."

This work builds on several ongoing studies at Siple Dome in West Antarctica and Dome C in East Antarctica.  It is well known that the microstructure of ice evolves with depth and time in an ice sheet. This evolution of microstructure depends on the ice flow field, temperature, and impurity content. The ice flow field, in turn, depends on microstructure, leading to feedbacks that create layered variation in microstructure that relates to climate and flow history. The research proposed here focuses on developing a better understanding of: 1) how ice microstructure evolves with time and stress in an ice sheet and how that relates to impurity content, temperature, and strain rate; 2) how variations in ice microstructure and impurity content affect ice flow patterns near ice divides (on both small (1cm to 1m) and large (1m to 100km) scales); and 3) in what ways is the spatial variability of ice microstructure and its effect on ice flow important for interpretation of climate history in the WAIS Divide ice core. The study will integrate existing ice core and borehole data with a detailed study of ice microstructure using Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) techniques and measurements of borehole deformation through time using Acoustic Televiewers. This will be the first study to combine these two novel techniques for studying the relation between microstructure and deformation and it will build on other data being collected as part of other WAIS Divide borehole logging projects (e.g. sonic velocity, optical dust logging, temperature and other measurements on the ice core including fabric measurements from thin section analyses as well as studies of ice chemistry and stable isotopes.  The intellectual merit of the work is that it will improve interpretation of ice core data (especially information on past accumulation) and overall understanding of ice flow. The broader impacts are that the work will ultimately contribute to a better interpretation of ice core records for both paleoclimate studies and for ice flow history, both of which connect to the broader questions of the role of ice in the climate system. The work will also advance the careers of two early-career female scientists, including one with a hearing impairment disability. This project will support a PhD student at the UAF and provide research and field experience for two or three undergraduates at Dartmouth. The PIs plan to include a teacher on their field team and collaborate with UAF's ""From STEM to STEAM"" toward enhancing the connection between art and science."

This study uses X-ray observations from an astrophysics satellite to probe the exosphere and understand how it is impacted by solar activity. The work is relevant to understanding space weather and how it affects satellites, high frequency communications, GPS, and other technological systems relevant to commercial interests and national security - a national priority set out in the National Space Weather Action Plan. The project will support an early-career tenure-track faculty member from an underrepresented group at a minority-serving institution and a graduate student's Ph.D. thesis work. This project is jointly funded by the Magnetospheric Physics program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This project will investigate solar activity impact on the dayside exospheric density by applying the methodology of Connor & Carter [2019] to the larger XMM-Newton solar wind charge exchange (SWCX) dataset. The project will answer the following three questions: 1) What is an exospheric neutral density at the nominal 10 RE subsolar location, 2) How does the density change during solar minimum, and 3) How does the density change during solar maximum? First, the XMM-Newton dataset will be analyzed to make a list of the strong SWCX events during relatively constant solar wind conditions. Only the stable solar wind conditions will be considered to avoid the complexity of magnetosheath modeling. Then, the PI will select at least 10 strong SWCX events, 5 for solar minimum and 5 for solar maximum, and simulate those events using a global MHD model. They will compare the modeled magnetosheath parameters with contemporary in-situ observations of the heliospheric spacecraft missions such as Cluster, THEMIS, and MMS. After the validation test, they will calculate the magnetosheath contributions from the MHD model and subtract their effect from the SWCX observations. Finally, the exospheric densities will be calculated at 10 RE subsolar location and investigate the density variation between solar minimum and solar maximum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Four key quantities that may be measured from Lagrangian data are the diffusivity, the Lagrangian integral timescale, the spin parameter and the spectral slope or (equivalently) the fractal dimension. The first three are of active interest to the oceanographic community due to their relevance for increasing the fidelity of the ocean circulation in large-scale ocean and climate models. The fourth quantity, the spectral slope, is potentially of equal importance, yet both its values and it meaning are largely unexplored, and it has yet to be examined on global scale. These Lagrangian characteristics are central to a number of important hypotheses; yet the difficulties in estimating them from data are well known and lead to outstanding uncertainties. As shown herein, these four quantities are tightly connected because they describe the four most important features of the frequency spectrum of Lagrangian velocities - a fact which suggests a new and unified approach to their analysis, by directly investigating the details of the spectrum itself. The proposed study will apply rigorous techniques from Big Data to estimate all four Lagrangian characteristics simultaneously from all available Lagrangian data. The result will be the highest resolution maps yet made of the Lagrangian characteristics, both at surface and at depth. The overarching goal of increasing the realism of the ocean circulation in climate models is a topic of great societal interest, because it would bolster climate variability adaptation and mitigation efforts. More immediately, this project will contribute to the maintenance, improvement, and broader distribution of the only active archive of acoustically tracked float data, one of the most valuable in situ windows into the ocean circulation. Innovative analysis algorithms developed or refined throughout this project will be openly shared with the community, contributing to the software infrastructure that supports scientific research. A new, highly optimized implementation of idealized numerical models for geophysical fluid dynamics will similarly be further developed, and distributed to community, during this project. The application of Big Data techniques to model output, allowing very large datasets to be reduced to much smaller numbers of parameters, will be particularly useful in future model/data intercomparisons. Finally, this project will support a graduate student, who will be trained in the application of Big Data techniques to analyzing numerical model output, as well as an early-career scientist.<br/><br/>The approach will build on previous work in several important ways: (i) by making best use of available statistical information, thereby increasing the effective spatial resolution, perhaps dramatically; (ii) by avoiding potentially serious estimation errors arising from interactions of the four parameters; (iii) by allowing quantification of uncertainty; and (iv) by permitting the formal and systematic testing of a number of important physical hypothesis. A parallel analysis of a vastly larger ensemble of trajectories from a realistic model will allow quantification of uncertainties arising from data sparsity, and will enable the model's skill at reproducing observed Lagrangian features to be closely scrutinized. Finally, idealized numerical modeling and theory will provide the bridge to directly connect the observable features of Lagrangian trajectories with the underlying physics. The main intellectual contribution will be to answer a number of important questions, framed in detail herein, such as: Can the influence of surface quasigeostrophy, interior quasigeostrophy, and other processes be distinguished on the basis of their Lagrangian spectra? What does the Lagrangian spectral slope tell us about the nature of ocean turbulence? When and where is anisotropy necessary to effectively describe diffusivity? Does the spin parameter accurately capture the effect of coherent eddies on the background spectrum? These and other questions can be answered with the first global study of Lagrangian velocity spectra, with careful attention to quantifying errors and to establishing the correct physical interpretations of the controlling parameters in different regimes."

This has led to increased glacier melt, widespread glacier retreat, ice-shelf collapses, and glacier speed-ups. Many of these changes are driven by changing precipitation and increased melt due to warmer air temperatures. This project will use a combination of two models - a regional atmospheric model and a model of processes at the glacier surface - to simulate future changes in temperature and snowfall, and the resulting changes in glacier mass. The combination of models will be tested against the observational record (since 1979 when satellite observations became available), to verify that it can reproduce observed change, and then run to the year 2100. Results will provide better estimates of the impacts of future climate changes over the Antarctic Pensinsula and the expected glacier mass changes driven by the evolving climate. <br/><br/>The project will use the large changes observed on the Peninsula to validate a model framework suitable for understanding the impact of these changes on the glaciers and ice shelves there, with the goal of developing optimally constrained future climate and surface mass change scenarios for the region. The framework will provide both a coherent picture of the impacts of past changes on the region?s ice cover, and also the best available constraints on forcings that will determine ice mass loss from this region going forward under a standard scenario.  The Weather Forecasting and Research (WRF) Model will be used over the domain of the Antarctic Peninsula and neighboring islands to quantify trends in spatio-temporal patterns of mass change with a focus on surface melt. The WRF model will be enhanced to account for the specific conditions of glacier surfaces, and the modified model will be used to simulate climate conditions and resulting surface mass budgets and melt over the period 1979-2100. Tying modeled past climate changes to the surface and satellite-based observational record will provide a foundation for interpreting projected future change. Results will be validated using available weather station observations, surface mass-balance data, and satellite-derived records of melt.  The activity will foster partnerships through collaboration with colleagues in Spain, Germany and The Netherlands and will support an early-career postdoctoral researcher and two graduate students, introduce undergraduate and high-school students to original research and provide training of students through inclusion of data and results in course curriculums."

Observations of this region, known as the thermosphere, commonly show long periods (days to weeks) of relatively placid conditions, punctuated by large disturbances that can only be described as ""storms"". However, even quiet times exhibit a substantial and often seemingly random background of day-to-day variability. In the troposphere, large storms develop internally, without a requirement for sudden impulsive changes by externally imposed forcing or regional boundary conditions. While internal instability does also play a role in Earth's ionosphere and thermosphere (especially at low latitudes); much of the thermospheric weather is instead directly driven from outside by forcing from regions above and below. Upward propagating waves and tides make a ubiquitous contribution to the low-level day-to-day variability, whereas fluctuations in the solar radiation, solar wind, and Earth's magnetosphere dynamics drive a broad spectrum of thermospheric perturbations - and are entirely responsible for driving storms and other large events. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to understand the origins of day-to-day fluctuations in thermospheric weather, both large and small. Two state-of-the-art remote sensing instruments measuring thermospheric wind and temperature will be deployed in Antarctica, at latitudes that have been shown by previous studies to host the most extreme and complex thermospheric weather behavior. While previous work has measured thermospheric winds and temperatures across the globe for many years, there have never been instruments at these geomagnetic latitudes with anything even close to the proven sensitivity, resolution, and field of regard that are achieved by the proposed all-sky imaging design. Demonstrated performance of these new Fabry-Perot Spectrometers exceeds that of the previous generation of instruments at the Antarctic McMurdo and South Pole stations by more than two orders of magnitude, which will open revolutionary new insights in the fluid dynamics of Earth's polar-cap thermosphere. <br/><br/>This award will address a number of specific outstanding questions of aeronomical research: What is the main source of complex day-to-day variability that has been observed in the generally anti-sunward neutral flow across the polar cap? What are the mechanisms responsible for discrepancies between observed and modeled temperatures and tidal amplitudes within the polar cap? Do thermospheric gravity waves, propagating poleward from the auroral oval, deposit a significant flux of heat and/or momentum into the polar cap thermosphere? Are there any signatures of anthropogenic climate change and/or declining solar activity in the long-term record of thermospheric temperatures at South Pole?<br/><br/>Cutting-edge science, international partnership, and travel to Antarctica provide an ideal opportunity to achieve the project's education and outreach goals. Anticipated broader impacts from this project include training of a Ph.D. graduate student, furthering international scientific collaboration and cooperation in Antarctica, and providing real-time and archive data that will be of operational value to satellite operators, communicators, and navigators."

A soliton is a special type of wave that shows a remarkable stability when traveling through various media. Examples include such well-known phenomena as tsunami waves and pulses in optical fibers. The first observation and scientific description of a soliton was given by Scott Russell in 1834. The equation describing what Russel had observed was derived in 1895 by Korteweg and de Vries but it was not until 1967 when this equation, now called Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), was solved in closed form by Gardner, Greene, Kruskal, and Miura. Their method is regarded as a major achievement of the 20th century science. It gave rise to soliton theory, applicable to broad classes of physically important evolution partial differential equations, ranging from hydrodynamics of water waves (rogue waves in the ocean) and nonlinear optics (propagation of information in optical fibers) to astrophysics, atmospheric sciences, and elementary particle theory. This project will develop novel approaches to extend the theory to the physically and practically important cases of slowly decaying waves, which are still beyond the reach of the current methods. The project will have a very large educational component. The investigator is committed to continuing his research experience for undergraduates program on nonlinear wave phenomena. This program is designed to identify and mentor young scholars in the field of applied mathematics. It is his intent to attract a diverse (gender, ethnicity, disability) group of talented undergraduates into the program to broaden the participation of underrepresented in the mathematical sciences groups.<br/><br/>Integrable systems have been primarily studied in the connection with propagation of waves initiated from rapidly decaying or periodic initial data. In the KdV context, the corresponding solutions have a relatively simple and well understood wave structure of running solitons accompanied by radiation of decaying waves, or periodic wave-trains and their modulations. However, any deviation from such data meets principal difficulties. The main thrust will be put on understanding of the effect of slower decay (or even no decay) at spatial plus infinity. Physical motivations include modeling rogue waves, nonlinear wave propagation in (pseudo) periodic media with slowly decaying amplitude, integrable turbulence, and propagation of coherent structures in noisy media. From the mathematical viewpoint, it is an uncharted territory. Slower decay at plus infinity causes serious complications at every step of the IST. The main effort will be put on understanding how to make the method of the Riemann-Hilbert problem, a modern powerful machinery of asymptotic analysis, work far outside of the realm of classical problems. To this end, developing direct/inverse scattering theory for long-range potentials will be required. The investigator expects to find new types of solutions with far-reaching practical applications, which include, but not limited to, the understanding of rogue waves, soliton propagation on different backgrounds, and the study of propagation of more general coherent structures in noisy media appearing in such diverse disciplines as hydrodynamics, telecommunication, atmospheric sciences, nonlinear optics, plasma, astrophysics, and other areas where integrable systems naturally arise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some work suggests that river flow is a stronger determinant than the quantity of plant production on the flow of energy through the food web, but little is known about how the quality of plant food affects food chains and biodiversity.

Extreme event statistics and spectral analyses will characterize properties of flood intervals and flow regime shifts across 12 study sites spanning a gradient in timing of rainfall and hydrologic variation (monsoon vs. winter precipitation dominance) in Arizona. Derived hydrologic metrics will be used in combination with measures of ecosystem metabolism, N supply, secondary consumer energetic efficiencies, resource stoichiometry, and the proportion of autochthonous energy sources as predictor variables of food chain length and trophic structure to understand the mechanisms linking energetics and hydrology to food chain length. This comparative study includes 12 streams within the same biogeographic province that feature an algal-dominated food source and similar ecosystem size (1st-3rd order streams).

It aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders.  This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.<br/><br/>Working together in this Collaborative Research Action, the partner agencies have provided support for research projects that utilize existing Arctic observing systems, datasets and models to evaluate key sustainability challenges and opportunities in the Arctic region, to innovate new sustainability science theory and approaches to these challenges and opportunities, and support decision-making towards a sustainable Arctic environment.

This unique permafrost-based ecosystem is currently threatened by global warming. In addition to the direct effects of this warming, permafrost degradation may cause further change in vegetation and carbon budget and greenhouse gas emission that may then feedback to the climate system.  In this vulnerable region, considerable economic and demographic change is taking place as populations within the cities of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) expand and increase their carbon emissions, while smaller settlements decline and struggle to afford heating fuel due to rising costs associated with the urban demands for energy.  The environmental impacts of population and emission growth in this environmentally vulnerable region and the need for viable low carbon energy solutions for Arctic residents drive the COPERA project.  The collaborative research team from the US, Russia, and Japan will establish a permafrost, hydrological, and meteorological observing network in cooperation with local communities to estimate CO2 sequestration by the permafrost ecosystem (tundra and taiga) and CO2 emission form cities and villages. In this study, the carbon budget (CO2 sequestration by ecosystem and CO2 emission through human activity) is estimated as a measure of two different points of view. One is a measure of impact on climate and environment, and the other is that of living cost because more fuel combustion means higher cost for energy. Both of these measures have impacts well beyond the local effects in the Sakha region. Data gathered during this project will be translated into publicly accessible materials and shared with local residents and government to inform municipal, regional, or Republic governmental committees and/or council meetings."

The EEB acts like a railroad switch, controlling where that freshwater moves within the Arctic Ocean and sub-polar seas. The freshwater input from rivers is increasing as the Arctic warms. This makes understanding processes in the Eastern Eurasian Basin especially important. This study aims to understand how the EEB redistributes ice and fresh water between the eastern and western Arctic in response to changes in the atmosphere. Three biennial cruises, planned for August-September, will take measurements between Franz Josef Land and the central East Siberian Sea, following a path that moves from shallow water to the deep sea. The sampling program connects observations using moorings, ship sampling, and drifters. These efforts will inform the scientific community and the broader public about major changes in the EEB that could impact the state of Arctic ice cover, marine ecosystems, and areas further south. The proposed observations are also important for developing estimates for future summer sea-ice conditions, which are valuable information for national security, the transportation industry, and weather forecasting. A graduate student and a K-12 teacher will join the cruises to engage in research. Together with a researcher, they will share and reach out to classrooms and the general public. The project will support one graduate student. <br/><br/>The eastern Eurasian Basin (EEB), including its shelves distributes ice and Arctic riverine water between the Eastern and Western Arctic. This provides the shortest pathway for Arctic freshwater to the sub-polar seas where weak stratification leads to deep convection, a key mechanisms of global thermohaline circulation. Recent observations have captured unprecedented changes in the EEB, likely representing a fundamental shift to a new, less stable, more dynamic mode. The goal of our study is to develop a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of how the EEB functions, accumulating and releasing major Arctic riverine transports and redistributing ice and fresh water between the Eastern and Western Arctic in response to atmospheric and oceanic forcings. Quantifying EEB freshwater inventories and transports, following alternating atmospheric regimes, will be critical to future understanding of the Arctic Ocean's oceanography.

The objectives of the project are: (1) to obtain new measurements of duct widths, density enhancements, and occurrence patterns and morphology as a function of geomagnetic and solar activity; (2) to gain new understanding of physical processes that lead to the formation, sustenance, and decay of ducts; and (3) to gain a new understanding of the role of ducts in inner magnetospheric processes. An approach involving data analysis and ray tracing simulations will be used to achieve the objectives described above. The WM and ZM radio sounding and passive measurements from RPI/IMAGE will be the principal source of data used in this research.

The main objective is to understand how breaking gravity waves produce SGWs and then to assess the subsequent effect of SGWs on the mesosphere and lower thermosphere region. Studying the process of developing SGWs is necessary because these waves would potentially transport momentum to higher altitudes than the primary GW. The science plan of this project would also consider whether some of these SGWs could propagate even through a critical layer. These are important aspects of the coupling processes between different atmospheric layers. This question of energy transfer between atmospheric regions is a potentially transformative area of research and is an active topic in atmospheric research now that observations and models have recently become available. This project would help support two early career researchers with the lead Principal Investigator (PI) being a woman thus improving the gender diversity within the space physics community.<br/><br/>While theory and modeling demonstrate the presence of secondary gravity waves, there are few observational, statistical, and combined modeling and observational studies on SGW generation and associated momentum flux and influences within the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region. The research aims to answer the following questions: 1) How do stratospheric and mesospheric conditions play a role in the evolution and propagation of gravity waves into the MLT and the progression of breaking conditions leading to SGW generation? 2) What are the implications of gravity wave breaking and resulting secondary gravity waves on momentum transport in the MLT? 3) What is the correlation between strong orographic gravity wave activity observed in the Northern hemisphere and observations of different gravity wave spectra in the MLT?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project promises to reduce the uncertainty in climate prediction associated with the smallest scale physical processes that cannot be explicitly solved by climate models. The project will address three aspects of ocean mixing: near field mixing at internal wave generation sites, mixing due to breakdown of internal wave energy transported in the wave field, and far field mixing due to breakdown of internal wave energy away from sources. Parameterizations will be based on data-based relations for wave physics, radiation balance theory, and results from process models. In addition to be being based on sound theoretical ideas, the parameterizations will also be based on observational results from the growing data set of microstructure observations."

By combining statistical modeling, stochastic analysis, and the tools of computational science together with a widely-used volcanic particle dispersion code, this grant will provide tools to assess real time predictions of ash cloud motion that accounts for varying wind conditions and a range of model variables. More specifically, the PUFF computer code will be used as the ash cloud simulation tool. PUFF, which propagates an airborne ash plume, will be integrated with a volcanic eruption model called BENT. BENT outputs ash distribution as a function of time and height. This integration substitutes for the unknown PUFF input parameters several BENT inputs that are better (but not entirely) constrained by physics.  This integrated model will be used to develop a framework for analyzing the effects of uncertain parameters and of differing windfield models, on the output distribution for the cloud location. Polynomical chaos quadrature and stochastic integration techniques will be used to provide a quantitative measure of the reliability (i.e. error) of those predictions.  <br/><br/>Understanding the effects of uncertainty in dispersion model predictions are important to assess and mitigate potential hazards associated with volcanic ash clouds. There are economic and sociologic impacts both near the volcano and far downwind from the eruption. For example, the airline industry decides flight schedules, routes, and fuel consumption estimates, based in part on dispersion model forecasts.  The results of this research will provide decision makers and civil protection authorities with a framework for evaluating hazard risk. Importantly, this methodological development is independent of the specific PUFF code, so the framework for prediction and reliability analysis can be directly applied to other ash cloud codes, and more generally to other hazard models -- such as radiological and chemical plume dispersion, and gas release from truck or rail accidents."

Canyon-associated biological hotspots have persisted for thousands of years Along the Western Antarctic Peninsula, despite significant climate variability. Observations of currents over Palmer Deep canyon, a representative hotspot along the Western Antarctic Peninsula, indicate that surface phytoplankton blooms enter and exit the local hotspot on scales of ~1-2 days. This time of residence is in conflict with the prevailing idea that canyon associated hotspots are primarily maintained by phytoplankton that are locally grown in association with these features by the upwelling of deep waters rich with nutrients that fuel the phytoplankton growth. Instead, the implication is that horizontal ocean circulation is likely more important to maintaining these biological hotspots than local upwelling through its physical concentrating effects. This project seeks to better resolve the factors that create and maintain focused areas of biological activity at canyons along the Western Antarctic Peninsula and create local foraging areas for marine mammals and birds. The project focus is in the analysis of the ocean transport and concentration mechanisms that sustain these biological hotspots, connecting oceanography to phytoplankton and krill, up through the food web to one of the resident predators, penguins. In addition, the research will engage with teachers from school districts serving underrepresented and underserved students by integrating the instructors and their students completely with the science team. Students will conduct their own research with the same data over the same time as researchers on the project. Revealing the fundamental mechanisms that sustain these known hotspots will significantly advance our understanding of the observed connection between submarine canyons and persistent penguin population hotspots over ecological time, and provide a new model for how Antarctic hotspots function.<br/> <br/> <br/>To understand the physical mechanisms that support persistent hotspots along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), this project will integrate a modeling and field program that will target the processes responsible for transporting and concentrating phytoplankton and krill biomass to known penguin foraging locations. Within the Palmer Deep canyon, a representative hotspot, the team will deploy a High Frequency Radar (HFR) coastal surface current mapping network, uniquely equipped to identify the eddies and frontal regions that concentrate phytoplankton and krill. The field program, centered on surface features identified by the HFR, will include (i) a coordinated fleet of gliders to survey hydrography, chlorophyll fluorescence, optical backscatter, and active acoustics at the scale of the targeted convergent features; (ii) precise penguin tracking with GPS-linked satellite telemetry and time-depth recorders (TDRs); (iii) and weekly small boat surveys that adaptively target and track convergent features to measure phytoplankton, krill, and hydrography. A high resolution physical model will generalize our field measurements to other known hotspots along the WAP through simulation and determine which physical mechanisms lead to the maintenance of these hotspots. The project will also engage educators, students, and members of the general public in Antarctic research and data analysis with an education program that will advance teaching and learning as well as broadening participation of under-represented groups. This engagement includes professional development workshops, live connections to the public and classrooms, student research symposia, and program evaluation.  Together the integrated research and engagement will advance our understanding of the role regional transport pathways and local depth dependent concentrating physical mechanisms play in sustaining these biological hotspots.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ocean general circulation models are sensitive to the magnitude and geography of deep mixing, but very few observations of this process exist.  Understanding the location and mechanisms of tidal dissipation is necessary for their continued improvement.  The Tasmanian Tidal Dissipation Experiment?s (T-TIDE) hypothesis is that significant tidal dissipation takes place where propagating low-mode internal tides impinge on steep continental slopes.  Slope geometry affects wave reflection, transmission, scattering, and breaking, which in turn determine the spatial distribution of mixing.  Important breaking mechanisms may include lee effects at small-scale bathymetry and nonlinear bore formation near critical slopes.  We propose a coordinated observational/modeling effort to understand the physics geometry, and magnitude of dissipation and mixing.  The goals are to 1) identify where mixing occurs on the continental slope, 2) determine the dominant dissipative processes, 3) assess the amount of energy transmitted onto the shelf and reflected back into the deep sea to be dissipated elsewhere, and 4) generalize these results as a parameterization of topographic scattering and dissipation in numerical models, which ideally depends on the topography, stratification, and the barotropic and/or low-mode baroclinic tides.  The three main components to the experimental plan are 1) intensive 2D and 3D modeling before and after the fieldwork to plan and contextualize the measurements; 2) a glider based Scout Experiment to identify dynamic processes, evaluate models, and finalize mooring sites; and 3) a comprehensive Process Experiment using ships, gliders, and moorings with the time and space resolution to address T-TIDEs hypothesis and achieve its goals.  An array of profiling and fixed-sensor moorings will be combined with gliders acting as virtual moorings.  Tidally-resolving or higher-frequency observations will measure internal wave motions, energy fluxes, and dissipation and mixing either directly or via finescale parameterizations.  An altimetric analysis of internal-tide sea surface height will assess mesoscale refraction of the incident internal tide along with Australian gliders, which will monitor hydrography and internal tidal displacements in the Tasman Sea.  <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>The proposed work will provide global insights on the dissipation of tidal energy. Specifically, inclusion of tidal dissipation on continental slopes may be an important component of the next generation of mixing parameterizations in climate models.  Graduate students will be trained as part of the experiment.  In addition to its scientific import, T-TIDE will sponsor and participate in two training seminars with high school science teachers who are charged with delivering the earth science program in San Diego Unified School District.  This effort will be performed in conjunction with the Birch Aquarium at Scripps. Finally, an essential element of the project is the development of strong collaboration and resource sharing with Australian and Canadian scientists."

In particular, 3-D simulation of reconnection is                       innovative and it is expected to yield new and significant                      results in this field.  Previous research considered only two-                  dimensional MHD models of reconnection for the FTE (flux transfer               events).  The 3-D simulation is capable of showing longitudinal                 effects, thus enabling global studies of the reconnection                       process.  Other aspects of FTE studies will include electron heat               flux, evolution of helical flux tubes and ground signature.  In                 the magnetotail region, development of saugage and tearing modes                will be studied.  A simulation code based on the electromagnetic                particle code will be used for the study of the pulsating aurora.

Brown macroalgae (seaweeds) form extensive undersea forests in the northern portion of this region where they play a key role in providing both physical structure and a food (carbon) source for shallow water communities. Yet between Anvers Island (64 degrees S latitude) and Adelaide Island (67 S latitude) these macroalgae become markedly less abundant and diverse. This is probably because the habitat to the south is covered by more sea ice for a longer period, and the sea ice reduces the amount of light that reaches the algae. The reduced macroalgal cover undoubtedly impacts other organisms in the food web, but the ways in which it alters sea-floor community processes and organization is unknown. This project will quantitatively document the macroalgal communities at multiple sites between Anvers and Adelaide Islands using a combination of SCUBA diving, video surveys, and algal collections. Sea ice cover, light levels, and other environmental parameters on community structure will be modelled to determine which factors have the largest influence. Impacts on community structure, food webs, and carbon flow will be assessed through a mixture of SCUBA diving and video surveys. Broader impacts include the training of graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher, as well as numerous informal public education activities including lectures, presentations to K-12 groups, and a variety of social media-based outreach.<br/><br/>Macroalgal communities are more abundance and diverse to the north along the Western Antarctic Peninsula, perhaps due to the greater light availability that is associated with shorter period of sea-ice cover. This project will determine the causes and community level consequence of this variation in algal community structure. First, satellite data on sea ice extent and water turbidity will be used to select study sites between 64 S and 69 S where the extent of annual sea ice cover is the primary factor influencing subsurface light levels. Then, variations in macroalgal cover across these study sites will be determined by video line-transect surveys conducted by SCUBA divers. The health, growth, and physiological status of species found at the different sites will be determined by quadrat sampling. The relative importance of macroalgal-derived carbon to the common invertebrate consumers in the foodweb will be assessed with stable isotope and fatty acid biomarker techniques. This will reveal how variation in macroalgal abundance and species composition across the sea ice cover gradient impacts sea floor community composition and carbon flow throughout the food web. In combination, this work will facilitate predictions of how the ongoing reductions in extent and duration of sea ice cover that is occurring in the region as a result of global climate change will impact the structure of nearshore benthic communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solving global sanitation challenges significantly reduces economic burdens that manifest as health problems, productivity losses, and shortened life spans. The global water and wastewater treatment market will balloon past $674.72 billion by 2025, driven by the ever-increasing demand for freshwater used for drinking, industrial processes, and agriculture. Niche-based wastewater treatment needs such as hydraulic fracturing (a.k.a., fracking) are expected to expand on a massive scale and pose major commercial opportunities. Innovative, affordable, and scalable wastewater treatment technologies, such as those under development here, offer the only potential means of treating heterogeneous wastewater from a broad array of sources across a number of markets.<br/> <br/>This I-Corps project assesses early-stage commercial potential for supercritical water (sH2O) technology in water treatment applications. Rather than remove the water, the water is used to destroy wastes via heat and pressure above water's critical point (3,210 psi and 374 degrees C), where it becomes supercritical. The unique qualities of sH2O are that it penetrates like a gas, but dissolves like a liquid, making it a very useful destruction medium for any organic substances (e.g., fats, oils, greases, biomass, paper, and plastics), quickly turning these substances into fuel gases, leaving behind only clean water and value-added minerals. This project leverages advanced manufacturing processes to redefine scale and efficiency of wastewater treatment, taking a system from building-sized down to the size of a dining table. Doing so enables development of turn-key systems for market penetration at very high volumes (e.g., fracking or landfill leachate) all the way down to very low volumes, such as recreational-vehicle or single-household sewage treatment. Unlike current products, limited by conventional manufacturing practices, that can only be served at an industrial scale (individual components the size of buildings), this project's additive-manufacturing-enabled scalability can potentially disrupt traditional economies of scale throughout the global wastewater market.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

From these spectra, and other supporting optical data, the investigtors will deduce the location and the extent of the reconnection event on the dayside magnetopause, and the direction of convection.

Of great concern is the capacity of these fishes to withstand increases in temperature as the region of the Western Antarctic Peninsula warms at a rate faster than any other area in the Southern hemisphere. One particular group of Antarctic fishes, known as the icefishes, are particularly vulnerable to increases in temperature because unlike all other vertebrates on earth, icefishes are white-blooded due to their lack of the oxygen-binding protein hemoglobin. This greatly reduces their capacity to transport and deliver oxygen to tissues compared to red-blooded Antarctic fishes. Previous studies have shown that icefishes are indeed less tolerant to elevations in temperature but the underlying factors are completely unknown. Additionally, it is not understood if red- or white-blooded Antarctic fishes can adjust, or acclimate, to modest increases in temperature, similar to those changes in temperature the animals might experience as the earth warms. The investigators will determine if heart function and/or nervous system function limits thermal tolerance of Antarctic fishes, and will determine their capacity to acclimate to warmer temperatures.  The project will further the NSF goal of training new generations of scientists by training graduate and undergraduate students.  In addition, the project will collaborate with a high school biology teacher from a school which serves a largely minority student body. The students will learn about the marine environment, and will construct a camera to be used in the field to learn more about Antarctic fishes. Two students and the teacher will also attend a summer marine biology internship program.<br/><br/>Antarctic fishes within the suborder Notothenioidei (called ""notothenioids"") are among the organisms on earth least able to deal with changes in temperature. The hemoglobinless icefish are even less able to withstand temperature changes than are red-blooded notothenioids. While this is well documented, the underlying physiological and biochemical mechanisms responsible are unknown. The investigators will test the hypotheses that cardiac work is significantly greater in icefishes compared to red-blooded species, and that as temperature increases, the greater cardiac work of icefishes, coupled with reduced blood oxygen-carrying capacity, results in cardiac failure at a lower temperature compared to red-blooded species. They also hypothesize that neuronal function limits thermal tolerance of red-blooded notothenioids. These hypotheses will be tested using a wide variety of experiments. For example, the investigators will measure heart rate concurrently with critical thermal maximum. They will also characterize metabolic and gene-expression responses to elevated temperature and determine if mitochondrial function contributes to thermal tolerance using a variety of techniques. To determine if neuronal function limits thermal tolerance they will quantify behavioral responses to warming of whole animals and to warming of only the brain area. They will also determine if acclimation to warmer temperatures impacts heart function and they will measure activities of a variety of enzymes from central metabolic pathways."

The ionosphere, thermosphere, and magnetosphere comprise a tightly coupled system at high latitudes. The ionosphere is the mediating element in this view, facilitating the transfer of free energy generated by solar wind-magnetosphere coupling into heat and bulk motion of the neutral atmosphere. This mediation occurs through electric fields, particle precipitation, diffusion, and field-aligned currents, agents that act collectively to structure the plasma density and composition within the system. Although elements of this system have been studied in considerable detail, their nonlinear interactions, and the global implications of these regional processes, remains poorly understood and inadequately observed. The electronic steering capability of PFISR offers a unique diagnostic to fill this gap. Using a dense grid of beams, a three-dimensional, time dependent view of the ion-neutral interactions can be developed. These results, in coordination with observations by common volume optical, and VHF and HF radar observations, allow access to system dynamics and system responses which were previously unobservable. The experimental campaign, involving twenty researchers from nine institutions, will be carried out over two winter seasons. The results will be used to address fundamental questions of the physics of the upper atmosphere and its coupling to the magnetosphere and the lower atmosphere, which have remained obscured for lack of key data. As a result, although it is understood that small-scale processes play critically important roles in this coupling, they have been difficult to include in quantitative models. The new information will be implemented in the GITM model validating the new understanding of the coupled magnetosphere, ionosphere and thermosphere, and thereby providing enhanced simulation capabilities."

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, the release of which from Arctic sources is poised to increase with climate warming. This project will expand upon a successful pilot study that included the initial testing of autonomous continuous fluid sampler and sensor systems. The proposed expansion will involve additional capabilities and the deployment of a sampling unit in each of six small lakes along a north-south gradient in the Mackenzie River delta in the Canadian Arctic for a nine-month period, spanning the winter season. With these data the investigators aim to characterize the physical, chemical, and microbial conditions in the water column to elucidate hydrologic, microbial, and weathering processes during the winter season, when methane builds in lake water under the ice cover. The investigators hypothesize that sudden (week, days, or even hours) releases of methane, following spring flooding and ice cover breakup, produce a distinct atmospheric flux from Arctic lakes that would otherwise be missed, since most logistically reasonable sampling occurs in the summer months when methane concentrations in these lakes are low or below detection.<br/><br/>The majority of methane flux to the Arctic atmosphere is estimated to come from soils and small lakes, although these estimates are based on few direct observations with large uncertainties. This proposed study, using in situ samplers and sensors, will allow an extensive microbial, gas and ion analytical program coupled with a network of physical and chemical sensor data to assess temporal conditions during winter months; to confirm fundamental processes and rates; to determine the interplay among microbial, geochemical and physical processes; and to develop a plan for a more inclusive study that takes advantage of low cost proxies for significant processes that best characterize temporal aspects of lake conditions. The project will enhance infrastructure for future research in the Arctic through the development of novel in situ sampling. The project will support several undergraduate and graduate students, providing valuable lab-based experience for students from non-research-intensive institutions. The investigators also will conduct two informal outreach activities to communicate the importance of Arctic climate change to primary school students while also teaching them about design and engineering. They also intend to work closely with Aurora College and Aurora Research Institute based in Inuvik, Canada, to engage First Nations youth."

Fluids that were trapped in the pores and minerals of the Pacific Plate are liberated during this subduction. These fluids react with rock in the overriding Philippine Plate to produce a slurry of mud and fluids that are very alkaline (with a pH up to 12.5, more alkaline than Clorox), yet support microbial life that thrives in such extreme environments. The discharge produces the largest mud volcanoes on Earth, some spanning 50 km in diameter and several kilometers in height. Probing the mud volcanoes by sampling fluids from boreholes drilling into them, provides the means to examine processes that occur at depth during subduction. The subduction zone environment is the epicenter for most large earthquakes on Earth, and the fluids that flow through subduction zones can be connected with that earthquake generation. Moreover, the reactions that occur to produce the fluids provide energy that can support a wide variety of microbes, a subseafloor biosphere that is present throughout what has been referred to broadly as a ""deep crustal aquifer"".<br/><br/>The research team proposes to the sample fluids and dissolved gases from this ascending slurry in three mud volcanoes that tap different pressure (depths ranging from 10 to 20 km) and temperature conditions at depth. These ascending fluids discharge from scientific boreholes that were emplaced during International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 366. Prior to sampling these fluids, CORK-Lite instruments will be deployed to enable sampling operations. This infrastructure will also provide for a range of potential experimentation and monitoring efforts that can be used in the future. Specifically, the project will: (i) design, fabricate, and deploy CORK-Lites, (ii) sample discharging fluids with gas-tight and large volume sampling systems, (iii) analyze collected fluids for a range of solutes, dissolved gases, and isotopes, and (iv) measure borehole pressure and fluid discharge rates. The CORK-Lites will be sealed at the end of the field program for future experimentation and monitoring efforts. Results from this effort will test a model of abiotic methane formation, constrain the extent of serpentinization during the initial stages of subduction, set limits on potential microbial metabolic capabilities, and resolve water-rock reactions and solute sources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, in the ocean this seawater circulation, many times heated by buried magmatic bodies, transports and releases 25% of the Earth's heat. The rate of fluid flow through ocean crust is estimated to be equal to the amount of water delivered by rivers to the ocean. Much of what we know of this subseafloor fluid flow comes from studies in the eastern Pacific Ocean on ocean crust created by medium and fast spreading mid-ocean ridges. These studies indicate that seawater and its circulation through the seafloor significantly impact crustal evolution and biogeochemical cycles in the ocean and affect the biosphere in ways that are just now beginning to be quantified and understood. To expand this understanding, this research focuses on fluid flow of seafloor generated by slow spreading ridges, like those in the Atlantic, Indian and Arctic Oceans because it is significantly different in structure, mineralogy, and morphology than that formed at fast and intermediate spreading ridges. This research returns to North Pond, a long-term; seafloor; fluid flow monitoring site, drilled and instumented by the Ocean Drilling Program in the Atlantic Ocean.  This research site was punctured by boreholes in which fluid flow and geochemical and biological samplers have been deployed for a number of years to collect data and samples. It also provides resources for shipboard and on-shore geochemical and biological analysis.  Broader impacts of the work include sensor and technology development, which increases infrastructure for science and has commercial applications. It also provides training for students and the integration of education and research at three US academic institutions, one of which is an EPSCoR state (Mississippi), and supports a PI whose gender is under-represented in sciences and engineering.  Public outreach will be carried out in conjunction with the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations.    <br/><br/>This project completes a long-term biogeochemical and hydrologic study of ridge flank hydrothermal processes on slow-spreading, 8 million year old crust on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The site, North Pond, is an isolated northeast-trending sediment pond, bounded by undersea mountains that have been studied since the 1970s. During Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 336 in 2011 and an expedition five months later (2012), sensors, samplers, and experiments were deployed in four borehole observatories drilled into the seafloor that penetrated into volcanic crust, with the purpose of monitoring changes in hydrologic properties, crustal fluid composition and mineral alteration, among other objectives. Wellhead sampling in 2012 and 2014 already revealed changes in crustal fluid compositions; and associated pressure data confirm that the boreholes are sealed and overpressured, reflecting a change in the formation as the boreholes recover from drilling disturbances. This research includes a 13-day oceanographic expedition and use of on-site robotically operated vehicles to recover downhole instrument packages at North Pond. It will allow the sampling of crustal fluids, recovering pressure data, and measuring fluid flow rates. Ship- and shore-based analyses will be used to address fundamental questions related to the hydrogeology of hydrothermal processes on slow-spread crust."

Despite the significance of these processes, little is known about the mechanics of ridge-flank circulation, including the physical and chemical nature of discharge and recharge sites, the pathways and lateral length scales of flow, and the depth extent of penetration into the oceanic crust. Global fluxes of major and trace elements through ridge flanks are also uncertain. We propose to investigate patterns of vigorous fluid circulation and associated fluxes on the eastern flank of Juan de Fuca Ridge. Results from a recent drilling transect in this area produced evidence for two important and unexpected ridge-flank hydrothermal processes: (1) upwelling of deeply-sourced hydrothermal fluids that penetrate an area also hosting shallow circulation, and (2) significant axis-parallel recharge in shallow basement, allowing recharging seawater to flow along strike over several to tens of kilometers. We will investigate the extent and efficiency of fluid, heat, and solute transport (a) across the strike of the basement relief (i.e., along a crustal aging profile, perpendicular to the spreading axis), (b) along the strike of the buried and partially buried basement ridges, including along deep axis-parallel faults, and (c) within the vicinity of conical basement edifices, probably small, long-extinct volcanoes, that penetrate through the nearly continuous sediment on the ridge flank. This work will document and evaluate these interpretations, to test competing hypotheses regarding the geometry of ridge-flank circulation, to constrain ridge-flank flux estimates, and to help select sites for a return of the drill ship for additional sampling and downhole experiments."

Within two days of the eruption onset the lava flows had already traveled nearly 10 km, covering an area of ~14 km2. The eruption has formed a series of cinder cones that feed lava flows, which at the time of this writing extend for nearly 20 km over the barren slopes of the volcano down into snow-covered forests. The investigators will join an international team of volcanologists who are monitoring the ongoing activity, and will focus on two important aspects of the eruption: (1) interaction of lava with snow and ice, and (2) temporal variations of the composition of erupted lavas and their crystal cargo.<br/><br/>Both of these topics are timely for improving our understanding of volcanic eruptions. Gaining a more quantitative understanding of how lava flows interact with snow and ice is critical for assessing hazards at snow and ice covered volcanoes and for improving our ability to recognize ancient deposits formed by lava-snow interactions. Few if any quantitative studies have been attempted in the field to quantify heat transfer from lava to snow or ice; this requires direct field measurements at the front of an active lava flow propagating through the snow/ice-dominating environment. While these conditions are highly ephemeral, they are now present at Tolbachik as the eruption began after much of the surrounding landscape had been covered by seasonal snow, which has created a unique opportunity to measure heat transfer between lava and snow/ice and provide more accurate constraints for experimental and theoretical modeling of their interaction. Having a better understanding of how lava flows rapidly melt snow and ice is important for identifying hazardous areas around snow and ice-covered volcanoes such as Mt. Rainier in the Cascades. Similarly, collection of lava and ash samples during and immediately after their eruption is important because: (i) their juvenile origin can be established unequivocally and (ii) their time of eruption is known precisely. These characteristics are critical for using a series of erupted products to observe compositional trends in the eruptive sequence and to identify magma processes that triggered and currently drive the eruption at Tolbachik. This RAPID award will allow sampling of the eruptive products before they are buried by ash or later lava flows."

However, the difficulty of obtaining accurate, real-time, and continuous volcanic emissions measurements is well known. Relating infrasound, or low frequency sound, to volcanic emissions shows particular promise towards quantifying and understanding volcanic emissions, suggesting that infrasound may provide a tool to indirectly quantify and characterize volcanic emissions. In this project we will perform a detailed, quantitative analysis of the diverse infrasound signals from Karymsky Volcano, Kamchatka, Russia with corresponding measurements of volcanic emissions. The primary objectives are to 1) identify and characterize the infrasound signals from the diverse activity at Karymsky, 2) collect detailed volcanic emissions data (both gas and tephra), 3) identify infrasound signals characteristic of certain types of emissions; and 4) quantitatively correlate temporal trends in infrasound signals with the mass flux of volcanic emissions. We aim to develop quantitative relationships between volcanic emissions and infrasound based both on theoretical and empirical analysis. An additional goal of this project is to validate a multi-spectral infrared camera technique for measuring volcanic emissions with established tephra sampling and ultraviolet remote sensing SO2 measurement techniques.<br/>This project addresses important questions in volcanology and geophysics regarding infrasound signals, volcanic emissions, and eruption dynamics. To address these questions an unprecedented multiparameter dataset will be collected and analyzed, which will lead to a better understanding of the release of volcanic emissions and their observable infrasound signals. This understanding will improve monitoring and detection of volcanic hazards and the viability of using infrasound as a remote, continuous tool to detect and characterize volcanic emissions will be evaluated. This project will also increase our understanding of eruption source mechanisms, which will benefit a wide variety of volcanologists and geoscientists. Collaboration amongst a highly qualified international team of scientists will occur. Education is emphasized heavily as students from the International Volcanological Field School will participate in the field experiment and will gain invaluable experience in active volcanism and international collaboration."

Knowing their history is necessary to understand the ancient, adjacent continents. The Amerasia Basin of the Arctic Ocean is a mystery. While it is an ocean basin, the familiar patterns created by seafloor spreading are not obvious. As a result, it has not been possible to understand the basin history. This project will study the history of three adjacent features in the Amerasia Basin: the Chukchi Borderland, the Alpha Ridge and the Canada Basin This project plan to use the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) portable, flexible multi-channel seismic reflection (MCS) system on a research vessel. This system, which has been successfully operated in thick pack ice, will collect MCS data, for stratigraphic and structural interpretation, and provide sufficient source strength for full crustal refraction work. Stronger constraint on the deep crustal structure will be obtained in two locations in the Canada Basin with ocean bottom seismometers (OBS). Refraction data will also be acquired with sonobuoys during MCS profiling and will be used to model upper crustal structure. The collection and analysis of the data will provide new knowledge about the formation of the Amerasia Basin and improve our understanding of the history of northeast Eurasia and northwest North America. This project will also help educate a new generation of Arctic marine geoscientists, support scientific ocean drilling to sample the sediments below the seafloor and help define the extent of US territory in the Arctic Ocean. <br/><br/>For the most part, current understanding of the Amerasia Basin is based on observations made on the adjacent continents and an assumption about the tectonic displacements that formed the basin. A new approach based on establishing critical relationships between adjacent features will make it possible to recreate the tectonic history of the ocean by scaling up from local relationships. The Chukchi Borderland is a block of extended continental crust embedded in the deep water Amerasia Basin. To understand the basin opening, it is necessary to restore the Borderland to its pre-opening position. The choice of this position distinguishes tectonic models of the basin which are not well constrained by observations. In previous work, a 2- MCS survey across the transition from the Chukchi Shelf to Borderland established that there have been only slight displacements across this boundary since Early Cretaceous. Understanding the structure and history of the northern edge of the Borderland, known primarily from bathymetric data, is the next step. In this area, three of the major structures of the Amerasia Basin intersect: the Borderland, Alpha Ridge and the Canada Basin. A dedicated MCS survey in this area will improve our understanding of these structures and their termination or continuation below the sediment cover to the north and east. In this project, MCS and refraction surveys will elucidate the relations between the overtly continental, high-standing block and the surrounding crust, which may be, in part, of continental composition as well. Observing the northern edge of the Chukchi Borderland and adjacent deeper water areas will, by distinguishing crustal types, provide new constraints on the history of the Amerasia Basin.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much attention has been given to how this will affect shelled animals like corals, but acidification also affects the algae that form the base of the ocean food chain. It is possible that future algal communities will look very different than they do today, with potentially negative consequences for fisheries, recreation, and climate. Alternatively, it is possible that these algae will be able to adapt rapidly enough to avoid the worst of it.  This study looks at algae adapting to acidification in real time in the lab, focusing on ""marketplace"" interactions between the algae and the bacteria they live alongside. The researchers also go to sea to learn whether adaptations from the lab experiments are beneficial under real-world conditions. Ultimately, this project is helping scientists better understand how the ocean's most important and most overlooked organisms will respond to the changes humans are causing in their habitat. The researchers also use their scientific work to create fun educational opportunities from grade school to college, including agar art classes where students learn about microbial ecology by ""painting"" with freshly-isolated ocean bacteria.<br/><br/>The effect of ocean acidification on calcifying organisms has been well-studied, but less is known about how changing pH will affect phytoplankton. Previous work showed that the mutualistic interaction between the globally abundant cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus and its ""helper"" bacterium Alteromonas broke down under projected future CO2 conditions, leading to a strong decrease in the fitness of Prochlorococcus. It is possible that such interspecies interactions between microbes are important for many ecological processes, but a lack of understanding of how these interactions evolve makes it difficult to predict how important they are. This project is using laboratory evolution experiments to discover how evolution shapes the interactions between bacteria and algae like Prochlorococcus, and how these co-evolutionary dynamics might influence the biogeochemical processes that shape Earth's climate. Four research cruises to the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series are also planned to study how natural algal/bacterial communities respond to acidification, and whether evolved microbes from laboratory experiments have a competitive advantage in complex, natural communities exposed to elevated CO2. The ultimate goal of this project is to gain a mechanistic understanding of microbial interactions that can be used to inform models of Earth's oceans and biological feedbacks on global climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

DENs are metric graphs with differential equations defined on the edges coupled by matching conditions at the vertices. DENs play a fundamental role in many problems of science and engineering. On the atomistic scale, physicists work with quantum dots and quantum waveguides. On the nanoscale, chemical engineers are interested in mechanical properties of nanorods. On the mesoscale, fiber networks modeled by strings and beams are crucial for tissue engineering, whereas on the macroscale grid structures involving pipes, plates and shells appear in civil and mechanical engineering. Control and inverse theories of DENs constitute an important part of the rapidly developing area of analysis on graphs. Being tremendously important for applications, these theories have not been, however, sufficiently developed. Control, observation and identification problems were studied almost exclusively for trees, i.e. graphs without cycles, although general DENs, which may contain cycles, are more important for applications. The project provides excellent training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>In this project, the principal investigator (PI) and his collaborators will develop a unified approach to control, observation, and identification of general DENs. This approach is based on the Boundary Control (BC) method in inverse theory, which uses deep connections between observability and identifiability of dynamical systems. The main results of the project will be: (a) uniqueness and stability conditions for solving inverse problems for DENs and effective algorithms for identifying the systems' parameters; and (b) controllability and observability conditions of the dynamical systems described by DENs and the methods for constructing the corresponding control and observation. The central idea is a proper choice of observations in the form of directional derivatives of the solutions to PDEs on graphs at some boundary and internal vertices to guarantee observability and identifiability of the corresponding systems. For general DENs, we will specify the sets of vertices where sensors and/or actuators should be situated. Another component of our approach is a new effective leaf-peeling (LP) method for solving inverse problems for differential equations on trees that has been recently developed  by the PI and his collaborators. In the current project we plan to extend this method to general graphs with cycles. Based on the BC and LP methods, numerical algorithms for solving inverse and control problems for general DENs will be developed and extensive numerical experiments will be performed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solitons are very special solitary waves that move with constant speed without changing their shape; the most prominent example is a tsunami wave. The first scientific description of a soliton was given in 1834 by Scott Russell. The equation describing what Russel had observed was derived in 1895 by Korteweg and de Vries (KdV), but it was not until 1967 when the KdV equation was solved in closed form. The method of solution, the inverse scattering transform (IST), is regarded as a major achievement of the 20th century mathematics. It gave rise to soliton theory that is dealing with broad classes of physically important differential equations which can be solved by a suitable IST (such equations are also called completely integrable systems). The range of applications is enormous: from hydrodynamics and nonlinear optics to astrophysics and elementary particle theory. Integrable systems have been primarily studied in the connection with propagation of waves initiated by rapidly decaying or periodic initial data (the ""classical"" data). The corresponding solutions have a relatively simple wave structure of traveling solitons accompanied by radiation of decaying waves, or periodic wave-trains and their modulations. However, any deviation from classical data leads to fundamental difficulties; it is the main focus of the project to overcome them. Entirely new types of solutions, with much more complicated wave structure and far-reaching practical applications, are expected to arise. The results could be used for understanding rogue waves, soliton propagation on different backgrounds (including noisy), tidal waves, certain meteorological phenomena (i.e. morning glory), or the study of propagation of coherent structures in noisy media (or in a general wave setting), in such diverse disciplines as hydrodynamics, telecommunication, atmospheric sciences, nonlinear optics, plasma physics, astrophysics, etc. The project will have a very large educational component. The principal investigator (PI) will continue his research experience for undergraduates program to identify and mentor young scholars in the field of applied mathematics. <br/><br/>In the KdV setting the PI has reformulated the IST in terms of Hankel operators and Weyl m-functions. It lets one extend the IST to a surprisingly broad class of initial data. The PI plans to continue using these powerful tools to identify the broadest possible class of initial data for which a suitable analog of the IST exists. Another objective is asymptotic analysis of the underlying solutions. The most powerful approach is based on the Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problem which also breaks down on such initial data in a number of serious ways. The main thrust will be put on understanding how to make the RH problem work far outside of the realm of classical problems. The results are expected to be instrumental for various applications. The accompanying mathematical problems are also very important to the theory of the Schrödinger operator, and the theory of Hankel and Toeplitz operators, fundamental objects of operator theory. Uncovering connections between soliton theory and Hankel operators is of great independent interest and could potentially have a profound influence on both theories. "

Orographic precipitation gives rise to the largest climatic and ecological gradients on Earth.  Air ascending on the windward side of the mountain range expands and cools, condensing the water vapor it carries and producing heavy rain- or snow-fall. As the air descends on the leeward flank, the air warms and dries out, leaving little-to-no precipitation.  This pattern of snowfall, caused by the interaction of winds and the landscape, is hypothesized to control the shape of the ice cap itself. The investigators hypothesize that feedbacks between precipitation and topography control ice flux and temperature, impacting basal conditions (frozen versus wet) and motion, which over long time scales can affect basal topography via erosion.<br/><br/>The authors propose to investigate the feedbacks between orographically driven precipitation, ice dynamics, thermodynamics, and basal erosion and uplift over the northern Antarctic Peninsula by coupling an orographic precipitation model to the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM). Using idealized and more realistic geometries, they will begin with a 2-D flow band model, which will be expanded into three dimensions to determine the strength of the feedbacks as a function of bedrock geometry and the intensity of the orographic precipitation gradient. The Antarctic Peninsula is targeted as the ideal case study, in the context of its rapid modern and future change as well as its deflation since the Last Glacial Maximum.  The broader impacts of the work include the strengthening of predictive models by capturing feedbacks related to orographic precipitation not included in current models. This is likely to provide a more realistic assessment of the impacts of orographic precipitation in a regime of changing climate. The project will support an early career scientist and a female mid-career scientist and will support one PhD student, and provide summer research experience for one undergraduate student as an REU supplement.  The project does not require field work in the Antarctic."

In total, the ice sheet stores enough water to raise sea level by approximately 6 meters.  However, how surface meltwater generated in the summer makes its way from its location on the ice sheet to the ocean is not well understood.  Two competing but not mutually exclusive theories are 1) the meltwater percolates into the ice sheet pores and is stored for a relatively long time.  2) The initial infiltrating meltwater refreezes at shallow depth in the firm, forming a hard pan that prohibits further infiltration.  In this latter case, the meltwater quickly moves downslope along the surface of the ice sheet until it drains into the ocean.  Rennermalm will test these hypotheses through a combination of field work, remote sensing from satellites, and modeling.  Moreover, Rennermalm believes that during the most recent warming, the shallow refreezing mechanism has been playing a lesser role in the delivery of meltwater to the ocean than in previous times. To explore this hypothesis Rennermalm will compare the physical characteristics of modern cores with those extracted from earlier expeditions.<br/><br/>The project will involve graduate and undergraduate student training.  The PI?s will collaborate with the Rutgers Film Bureau to ensure effective communication with the public.  The PI?s expect that the Rutgers Film Bureau director will seek to showcase the documentary at film festivals and other venues. In year one, two Rutgers Film Bureau members (the director and one student) will travel to Greenland to capture the day-to-day choices of scientific research in an extreme environment and produce a short multimedia narrative. <br/><br/>Sea level is expected to rise in the decades to come, partially due to the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.  However, we do not fully understand how meltwater generated on the surface of the ice sheet makes its way to the ocean.  One line of thinking is that surface meltwater makes its way into the porous ice sheet where it is stored, either refrozen or in a liquid state, for relatively long times.  Alternatively, as proposed by these investigators, the first seasonal meltwater that makes its way into the shallow ice, refreezes and blocks further infiltration, resulting in water that quickly moves down the surface ice sheet until it enters the ocean.  Knowing the fate of meltwater is imperative if we are to understand how fast sea level will rise in the future.  These investigators will integrate field work, computer modeling, and analyze data from satellites."

NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, and integrates the co-production of knowledge. This award fulfills part of that aim.<br/><br/>The Arctic is warming on average twice as rapidly as the rest of the planet, which is leading to significant changes in sea ice to which local communities must respond.  Beringia, a region of the Arctic encompassing US and Russian territory, is expected to experience some of the highest variability in sea ice conditions in the coming century. This project focuses on the question: how do we design better and more flexible governance and infrastructure to adapt to changing Arctic conditions?  To answer this question, the team is taking a convergence approach to forecast potential changes in the Arctic sea ice environment and the impacts on social and ecological systems resulting from those changes and identify adaptive strategies to enhance resilience to those impacts.  The project fully engages local and Indigenous communities and decision makers in the Arctic throughout the research process to generate information and models about critical hot spots of sea ice change relevant to local communities. This will help build local and regional governance capacity and allow the researchers to model and predict the robustness of communities to forecast changes.<br/><br/>Coproduction of knowledge between local and Indigenous communities and scientists, and collaborative research across disciplinary and national boundaries, will be used to address four key research questions:  1) How do people understand and perceive changing sea ice, and how do they adapt to variability in ice conditions? 2) Where are the current critical hot spots of variability in sea ice, and where will they be in the future as the environment and communities change? 3) How will governmental and non-governmental organizations in the region navigate changing sea ice conditions and interact with communities to respond to their changing needs? and 4) What features of the existing, and potential, social-ecological systems are robust/fragile to forecast changes in sea ice? This project will document diverse narratives and critical policy challenges around biogeophysical changes and associated livelihood and economic opportunities/costs between and within communities through grounded ethnography and cultural consensus analysis. Satellite data will be used to highlight ""hot spots"" of sea ice variability and provide a starting point for community and stakeholders' discussions of ""change"". Interviews with governance actors will identify priorities and responses and generate spatially explicit policy networks. A multi-agent model will link these analyses and be utilized to explore the diversity of issues, projections of change, and fragility or robustness of communities and the infrastructure systems they rely on. Through this research, the project will derive new understandings of community and institutional responses to change, the impacts of spatial and temporal variability within a trend, and robustness-fragility trade-offs that can be applied to other regions as they navigate transitions around the globe in the Anthropocene.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is intimately connected to the global system via ocean, land, and air masses, as well as the people that inhabit and/or are connected economically to the Arctic region. This is an unprecedented time in terms of rapid changes occurring in the Arctic, and our abilities to understand, predict, and respond to those changes are of US and international strategic interest. No single country is able to support the level of research necessary to keep pace with the changing Arctic, and therefore organizations like the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) represent vital platforms for discussing scientific issues and promoting international, interdisciplinary, and in some cases large-scale projects in the region. The impacts from melting sea ice on biogeochemical cycles, thawing permafrost and resulting change to the carbon cycle, biodiversity and northward species migration and ecosystem reorganization, and associated human interactions and response all link the Arctic to the global system and represent issues so important and so large that no one country can adequately address them in isolation. Additionally, new opportunities for economic development, fisheries, resource extraction and tourism carry a relatively high risk because Arctic science remains relatively immature. To this end, this project provides national support to maintain and enhance US leadership and partnerships in IASC, as well as our planning and coordinating roles for research efforts in the international arena.<br/><br/>The International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) is a non-governmental international membership organization that encourages and facilitates cooperation in all aspects of Arctic research, in all countries engaged in Arctic research, and in all areas of the Arctic region. IASC was established in 1990 and today comprises twenty-two member countries. IASC is an international associate of the International Council for Science (ICSU) and an observer in the Arctic Council and has connections to numerous other international Arctic organizations. The US is one of eight Arctic nations in the Arctic Council, with IASC playing a role in providing scientific input to this international policy organization. IASC assists with science development by providing scientific advice as well as coordination to support international science development. Since the founding of IASC, the scientific, environmental, economic and political realities of the North have changed dramatically. New problems and challenges demand new and improved scientific knowledge and enhanced coordination and communications. This grant provides funds to enable the President of IASC and the US delegates to IASC to implement the activities and execute the responsibilities of IASC.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will develop a unique long-term dataset to investigate how the speed and pattern of water-mediated glacier motion changes as a glacier?s shape and plumbing system adjust to a changing climate. The work will allow better prediction of future glacier change and enhance understanding of how glaciers shape landscapes over geologic time.

At present, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) is vastly undersampled throughout the oceans. This is due to conventional sampling approaches that rely primarily on discrete water sample collections from dedicated research cruises, underway measurements of surface ocean properties from transiting vessels, or time series measurements from in situ sensors on fixed moorings.  This sparse sampling coverage greatly limits the understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of carbon dioxide, the processes that control its cycling, and how its accumulation in the ocean impacts marine life via ocean acidification.  The researchers will develop a Carbon Seaglider that will, for the first time, be capable of autonomously measuring pCO2 at high resolution throughout the water column. Once available to the community, the Carbon Seaglider will advance the understanding of regional and global carbon cycling, ocean productivity, ocean acidification, and the ocean?s role in mitigating climate change. The Carbon Seaglider could also be applied to remote monitoring of the chemical habitat of CO2-sensitive organisms and thereby refine the understanding of ecosystem responses to ocean acidification. Enhanced monitoring of subsurface waters is also important to advance the early warning system for shellfish hatcheries and fishermen.<br/><br/>The researchers will develop an autonomous Carbon Seaglider by integrating a robust, proven and highly accurate pCO2 sensor (Kongsberg CONTROS HydroC CO2) into a highly capable, state-of-the-art autonomous coastal underwater glider (Kongsberg Seaglider C2). The primary products of this project will be a proven, science-ready pCO2-sensing Seaglider that is commercially available for a variety of ocean observing missions. This Carbon Seaglider will be accompanied by all of the software packages and operational documentation necessary to ensure user-friendly operation and high-quality data products. The new Carbon Seaglider will for the first time provide the ability to autonomously conduct high-resolution and adaptively sampled pCO2 measurements throughout the water column and across large range of spatial and temporal scales. Successful completion of this project will advance the Carbon Seaglider system to its final form and one that is proven to work effectively and reliably under a wide range of environmental conditions. This involves the final integration of these proven components into a fully functional system, optimization of its performance and operation, and rigorous developmental testing, evaluation, and operational demonstration during scientific mission. The proposed science mission in glacial meltwater affected Prince William Sound challenges both the pCO2 sensing capabilities (i.e. dynamics and variations) as well as the glider platform? capability (i.e. strong currents and density gradients). If these demonstration experiments are successful, it would prove that the Carbon Seaglider can be used for a variety of other scientific and monitoring missions, most of which would involve operations in much less demanding environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An increase in woody vegetation would reduce surface reflection of light and heat (albedo), and increase atmospheric water vapor, a positive feedback that is currently poorly included in climate models. In the Eastern Canadian Arctic (ECA) stratified sediment in lakes spanning the current interglacial and the warmer previous interglacial, preserve sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) and organic molecules that can be used for reconstruction of past ecosystems and their dependence on temperature and hydroclimate. By combining data from these sediments with modern vegetation studies and climate monitoring, an empirically based ecosystem-climate model will be developed to predict the likely evolution of Arctic ecosystems by 2100 under a range of climate trajectory scenarios. <br/><br/>This will be the first integration of sedaDNA-based vegetation records with biomarker-based climate records in lake sediment containing records of a much warmer Arctic. There are few ecosystem studies for the thin soils on crystalline terrain of the ECA. Floristic studies and vegetation-environment analyses around targeted lakes across a strong climate gradient establish the current relation between plant assemblages and summer temperature and define the relation between sedaDNA and nearby plant communities. Temperature loggers in soils, air, and lake- water, and analyzes of DNA and biomarkers in modern soils and lake surface sediment will enhance understanding of promising new molecular proxies and facilitate the development of regional training sets. The project brings together experts and state-of- the-art facilities in Arctic plant ecology, Paleoclimate, sedaDNA, and Organic Geochemistry to derive transformative new insight into the complex interplay between climate and biogeography at high latitudes, and will lead to a robust perspective on the potential response of ecosystems to anticipated future warming across the ECA. <br/><br/>The project team is committed to sharing research results with the broader public through outreach among local communities in the Canadian Arctic as well as at home. The team will work closely with Inuit guides and assistants during fieldwork, much of which is near traditional hunting and fishing lands, and will share results with nearby Inuit communities through displays at Parks Canada offices. A strong partnership with Nunavut Research Institute and its affiliated Arctic College has been developed over several decades, and this partnership will be expanded by establishing an interactive lake-monitoring program in collaboration with the Environment Technology Program students and staff of Arctic College. In Boulder, Colorado, a scholarship-supported summer field and lab course for underrepresented high school students will be developed based on paleoecological and paleoclimatic perspectives on climate change. This project will help launch two early-career scientists, one female and one Latino, as well as a career scientist and two postdocs, two of whom are female, and two new graduate students. The laboratory component will support several graduate and undergraduate assistants, who will gain valuable research experience and have the opportunity to complete theses based on their research activities."

In the contiguous US, nitrogen inputs have tripled relative to levels during pre-European settlement, primarily due to synthetic fertilizer production, atmospheric deposition from the combustion of fossil fuels, and through agricultural practices.  Consequently, many streams have dramatically higher nutrient concentrations than they did historically, which can lead to algal blooms, fish die-offs, and increased export of nutrients to marine ecosystems.  Streams can be important for regulating nutrient exports from continents to oceans, but the functioning is, in part, mediated by biodiversity, and rates of species losses in streams are among the highest on the planet.  Therefore, understanding interactions among changing nutrient inputs, and declining biodiversity are major and immediate challenges for conservation and management of freshwater ecosystems.  The number of available datasets on stream nutrient concentrations, stream flow, and biodiversity has increased rapidly, but many have yet to be evaluated for temporal or spatial trends, analyzed with state of the art statistical and modeling techniques, or compared across regions.  Further, many large datasets are coming online in the near future, and stream ecologists need to develop strategies to best utilize this emerging information.  The  goal of the Stream Resiliency Research Coordination Network is to link stream ecologists with hydrologists, statisticians, modelers, and resource managers to develop a synthetic understanding of how streams and river ecosystems will respond to chronic nutrient inputs and changing species diversity.  The network will meet through a series of workshops and webinars to develop new approaches to analyzing existing and forthcoming stream nutrient and organism datasets, and conduct state of the knowledge syntheses.  An initial one-day planning workshop associated with the 2014 Joint Aquatic Sciences meeting will be hosted to engage the research community.  Following the planning meeting, four three-day workshops will be held addressing topics focused on understanding long-term change in stream ecosystems, how ecosystem processes vary across river networks from small headwater streams to larger rivers, and the interactions among organisms in the context of changing climate, altered land-use, and loss of biodiversity.  Each workshop will include one day focused on training in data analysis and modeling approaches not typically used by stream ecologists, and two days focused on data analyses and synthesis.  In the last year of funding, a workshop will be hosted at the annual meeting of the Society for Freshwater Science to report back to the scientific community the activities of the network, and host a series of presentations about the state of knowledge.<br/><br/>Key functions of the network include enabling interactions among researchers and managers, and providing opportunities for young scientists to collaborate with established scientists.  The network will focus on developing novel conceptual frameworks and new analytical approaches to facilitate the synthesis of a wealth of existing datasets, as well as to provide the foundations for interpreting and guiding new research projects and sampling, and training opportunities for the next generation of scientists in the methods needed to deal with long-term datasets spanning large spatial scales.  Each workshop will include training of a targeted statistical or modeling approach, provide educational opportunity for both graduate students and established researchers, and produce tangible applied products for natural resource managers and policy makers.  In addition, an online graduate level seminar will be hosted focusing on stream functioning in a changing environment, providing an opportunity for students across the globe to learn about the activities and findings from the network."

Northern Asia, and particularly the subarctic zone of southern Siberia and northern Mongolia, has experienced rates of warming that are so far unprecedented elsewhere and provide an opportunity for the early study of human and environmental impacts due to global warming.  A Mongolian-American collaborative research team will investigate the three way relationship between pastoral nomadic food production, environmental robustness, and climate fluctuation in order to better understand principles of human organization that serve to sustainably manage this complex relationship.  Pastoral nomadism is an indigenous Arctic and subarctic subsistence economy that sustains numerous populations from Mongolia to the Arctic Ocean and is known for its flexibility, stewardship of rangelands, and productive success within small-scale societies as well as nation states.  By comparing early historical pastoralism and its socio-economic organization to environmental conditions and climate variation over more than a millennium, this project provides a deep-time perspective on sustainable and unsustainable practices in use today under a changing climate regime.  This research aims to promote successful adaptation to environmental change on behalf of a broad spectrum of communities and lifeways and across national borders.  The researchers believe that this research will help to sustain systems of indigenous food production throughout northernmost Asia with emphasis placed on maintaining local environments.  The results have broader applicability to other pastoral nomadic regions of the world, most notably the African continent in terms of environmental and land use policy making.  The project strengthens interdisciplinary collaboration and provides hands-on training for U.S. and Mongolian junior scholars, undergraduates, and graduate students in climatic bio-social science and cross-disciplinary research integration.<br/><br/> The project framework relies on a combination of high-resolution historical and environmental data that will be analyzed as time series and compared across two time scales: a short sequence of 25 years (1990 to present) and a long-sequence of 1300 years (700 AD to present).  Data from the past quarter-century will comprise 1) trends in forest productivity as revealed by the tree-ring record; 2) trends in steppe productivity; 3) ethnohistorical and ethnographic evidence of human use of these ecosystems in relation to recent socio-economic change; and 4) livestock population and mortality data. Contemporary patterns will be contextualized by more than one thousand years of climatic and socio-cultural observations. These will be compiled from tree-ring analysis, lake core and palynological studies, and from archaeological research, all of which provide alternate environmental indicators as well as a record of the relationship between nomadic pastoralists and the northern forest ecosystem.  By juxtaposing the trajectory of the forest-steppe and human communities over time, this research develops new approaches and insight to the linkages between ecosystems, climate, human culture, and policy that promote long-term sustainability.  Data and results will be widely disseminated through publications and public outreach but principally will be shared with and developed for the indigenous communities that rely on pastoralism across the Asian Arctic and subarctic biomes."

It serves as an important platform for the accumulation and transport of dissolved and particulate material, retained in the sea ice cover via atmospheric deposition, fluid exchange with the underlying ocean, sediment inclusions, and biological activity. This material, including nutrients, serves key functions in the Arctic Ocean ecosystem. However, the influence of sea ice processes on nutrient cycling and the seasonal cycle of important biogeochemical processes is poorly understood, especially as related to changes in Arctic sea ice. This project will quantify and track changes in the inventory and fluxes of key biogeochemical and physical parameters above, within and below the sea ice through a full year. Data collection and numerical simulations will improve modeling of key processes and projections of future states of the Arctic Ocean and its role in the Earth system. <br/><br/>The planed Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) project provides an opportunity to address pressing scientific questions revolving around the rapid transformations underway in Arctic marine physical and biogeochemical environments, linked to major losses in summer sea ice. This study contributes to the broader MOSAiC goals set by the research community, focusing on improved understanding and prediction of the Arctic through improved sea ice/ocean and earth system model parameterizations of key physical and biogeochemical processes. Collection of biogeochemical and physical data over an annual cycle at MOSAiC's central Arctic drifting ice camp will be informed by modeling needs, and apply community-endorsed standards and best practices for sample acquisition, processing and analysis. Field measurements and sampling will be closely coordinated with the MOSAiC team, with broad, rapid data sharing to inform field studies and modeling work. The extended observation period is essential to improve model parameterizations of snow-ice-ocean cycling of macro- and micronutrients and their impacts on Arctic ecosystems. This project will collect standardized ice data that are directly comparable with those of other participants and that are guided by and improve model simulations and projections. <br/><br/>This field effort will greatly enhance our understanding of sea ice seasonal cycles, including physical and biogeochemical seasonal evolution. Standardized field data will be made available to a broad international community. This project will leverage previously developed sampling schemes, protocols, custom-made equipment and a biogeochemical model as a strategic US contribution to the vast investment put forth by the international community towards the MOSAiC expedition. Educational impacts include the training and support of a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher.

Previous and ongoing studies have laid the foundations for improving the understanding of arctic carbon sinks and sources using observational studies, regional ice-ocean modeling, and recent global carbon cycle simulations.  However, there remain large uncertainties in the understanding of variability and change in the arctic marine carbon budget that are difficult to reconcile with existing tools.<br/><br/>This project will use the Regional Arctic System Model, comprised of marine biogeochemistry components in the eddy-resolving ocean and sea ice models to advance understanding and prediction of the arctic biogeochemical system, including shelf-basin and vertical nutrient exchange, the subsurface chlorophyll maximum, ice edge and under ice blooms and their role in ecosystem response to climate change.  It builds on the recent and ongoing research by the team of investigators, including the development and evaluation of the marine biogeochemistry components for global sea ice/ocean models and the high resolution Regional Arctic System Model.  The model simulates mass and energy exchange between sea ice, ocean, atmosphere and land on decadal timescales, with regionally constrained variability using observationally based atmospheric and oceanic datasets at lateral boundaries.  The research will: (i) evaluate and refine the established ocean marine biogeochemistry model, and (ii) add a newly developed sea ice algal biogeochemistry component within the existing model infrastructure. These model enhancements will help better quantify variability, complexity, and change in arctic marine primary production.  The overarching goal of this study is to achieve a comprehensive understanding of interactions between physical system components and the arctic marine carbon cycle, and to advance arctic system prediction at seasonal to centennial time scales with quantified uncertainty."

This process, called ocean acidification, decreases the pH and consumes carbonate ions. Ocean acidification is further enhanced as the Arctic Ocean?s sea ice cover is reduced over longer periods of time each year. The fast chemical changes of the waters are detrimental to many marine organisms. In particular, it makes it more difficult for calcifying organisms to build their calcium carbonate shells or skeletons. Since many of the calcifying organisms exist at the base of the food chain, there are potentially important, but poorly understood, consequences for the marine ecosystem.  This project will utilize and improve a numerical model of the physical circulation and biogeochemistry of the Chukchi Sea, a shallow sea peripheral to the Arctic Ocean, to study carbon dynamics and ocean acidification throughout the annual cycle.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to STEM workforce development through the provision of support to two early-career scientists during their formative years.  It will also provide support for the training of a graduate student.  Outreach to a local K-12 Aleut community will be enabled by participation in classroom activities during the annual ""Bering Sea Days"" on St. Paul Island.  The resulting model results will be a resource for related studies of the marine carbon cycle in the Arctic, such as the international Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) program and the Arctic Marine Biodiversity Observing Network (AMBON).<br/><br/>Little is known about the carbon dynamics of the Chukchi Sea in fall, winter and spring due to limited spatial and temporal data coverage in this remote and often inaccessible area. This project will utilize moderately high-resolution three-dimensional ocean and ice circulation regional physical-biogeochemical numerical model (ROMS + COBALT) integrations to study Chukchi Sea carbon dynamics and ocean acidification throughout the year. Hindcasts (1979-present) will be forced by meteorological reanalysis products and will account for lateral transport from the Bering Sea and central Arctic as well as input of organic and inorganic carbon from rivers and sea-ice melt water. Specific project tasks will include: data-based evaluation of the simulated ocean biogeochemistry system fields; characterization of the patterns of carbon dioxide system variability for the Chukchi Sea across time-scales; partition of the underlying physical and biological mechanisms; quantification of the downstream transport of organic and inorganic carbon using dye tracers and Lagrangian floats; and analysis of the sensitivity of ecosystem processes to ocean acidification."

Moths and butterflies are a conspicuous component of terrestrial habitats and one of the most diverse groups of plant-feeding animals worldwide. This group insect includes species of great economic importance. Their juveniles feed on plants useful to humans, including grains, cotton, tobacco, and timber and shade trees. However, many of the adults are beneficial as pollinators and are icons of conservation as evidenced by Monarch butterflies. Given their economic importance and sheer beauty, butterflies and moths are one of the most abundant insect group in museum collections, but only a fraction of the approximately 15 million specimens in non-federal collections have had their specimen label information digitally recorded and accessible to researchers and educators. Of those specimens that have been digitized, fewer than 10% of the North American Lepidoptera species have sufficient, accessible occurrence data to make reliable predictions about habitat use, susceptibility to global change impacts, or other ecologically important interactions. This project will digitize and integrate existing, unconnected collections of lepidopterans to leverage the outstanding potential of this group of organisms for transformative research, training and outreach. <br/><br/>The Lepidoptera of North America Network (LepNet) comprises 26 research collections that will digitize approximately 2 million specimen records and integrate these with over 1 million existing records. LepNet will digitize 43,280 larval vial records with host plant data, making this the first significant digitization of larvae in North American collections. LepNet will produce ca. 82,000 high-quality images of exemplar species covering 60% of North American lepidopteran species. These images will enhance remote identifications and facilitate systematic, ecological, and global change research. In collaboration with Visipedia, LepNet will create LepSnap, a computer vision tool that can provide automated identifications to the species level. Museum volunteers and student researchers equipped with smartphones will image >132,000 additional research-quality images through LepSnap. Up to 5,000 lepidopteran species will be elevated to a ""research ready"" status suitable for complex, data-driven analyses. LepNet will build on the existing data portal (SCAN) in consolidating data on Lepidoptera to the evolution of lepidopteran herbivores in North America. Access to these data will be increased through integration with iDigBio. Data for a broad range of research, including the evolutionary ecology of Lepidoptera and their host plants in the context of global change processes affecting biogeographic distributions will be generated. The LepXPLOR! program will spearhead education and outreach efforts for 67 existing programs, engaging a diverse, nationwide workforce of 400+ students and 3,500+ volunteers. Overall, LepNet will generate a sustainable social-research network dedicated to the creation and maintenance of a digital collection of North American Lepidoptera specimens (http://www.lep-net.org/)."

The volcano's proximity to the United States Antarctic Program McMurdo Station, its longstanding experimental infrastructure, and prior studies present opportunities to develop and apply cutting edge imaging methods to understand a persistently active volcanic system. This project will utilize data from a renovated five-station near-summit seismic network of Mt. Erebus plus three additional stations sited on the flanks of the volcano. This wide aperture network, paired with modern instrumentation and techniques to enhance seismic signal, will provide unprecedented imaging into the deep volcanic plumbing system at crustal scale, which will help researchers understand the volcano's complex structure and processes. Additionally, the network provides year-round seismic data to be used in temporal monitoring efforts for eruptive and other activity. All data from this network will be openly available in near real-time. The real-time data along with an existing catalog of archived data will be analyzed using recently developed methods to generalize, recognize, quantify, and catalog eruptive events. The project objectives are to study the response of the magmatic system to such events and use continuously recorded background noise and eruption signals to infer concurrent structural changes. These seismic investigations into the long-term changes of the volcano, tracking broad phenomena such as the subsidence of Ross Island, will also be complemented by GPS recordings of deformation. These activities will help test hypotheses related to the structure of the deeper magmatic system of Erebus and the properties of the material surrounding this system. The project funds two early-career scientists and three graduate students, contributing to the development of the next generation of volcanologists and seismologists.<br/><br/>This award results in the establishment of a first-tier monitoring system and catalogues eruptive events using real-time seismic and infrasound data. Synoptic analysis of broadband signals recorded by the updated seismic network will allow monitoring and interpretation of pre and post eruptive response and conduit evolution via measurements of systematic timing changes of short-period (explosion) versus very long-period (conduit) seismogram signatures. These observations will be supplemented by the interpretation of broadband seismic tilt in association with existing UNAVCO-supported GPS data over time scales from hours to years. Longer-period coda correlation back projection will be used to refine upper edifice structural information and teleseismic signals will be analyzed to examine the bulk and discontinuity structure of the underlying crust. The work includes a reanalysis of archived TOMO Erebus broadband, as well as extensive short-period data collected in 2007-2008. This effort will allow new imaging and interpretation of deeper (e.g., crustal to Moho-or-deeper scale) structure than has been previously imaged at Erebus in consort with other constraints, such as emerging magnetotelluric imaging results for Erebus and Ross Island. The researchers will use the year-round continuous stations to time-lapse interrogate prominent and repeatable structural/internal scattering features revealed by both ambient noise and eruption or other signal coda correlations. Joint inversions of H/V ratios for both coda and ambient noise coupled with dispersion curves assembled from the fusion of ambient noise (low frequency) and coda (high frequency) will complement direct imaging of strong near-surface scatterers and will be applied to archived ETB/ETS data sets. Cutting edge reflection matrix techniques will continue to be developed in collaboration with independently funded groups in France to further isolate and define high scattering bodies within the top 10 kilometers of the crust and edifice. This award is cofunded by the Prediction of and Resilience against Extreme Events (PREEVENTS) program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In high frequency ionospheric modification experiments interesting and potentially useful effects can be produced. For example, under suitable ionospheric conditions, operating the transmitter in a mode that couples the energy into the D-region can alter the ionospheric conductivity and modulate the electrojet currents, which then radiate electromagnetic waves at the modulation frequency. Waves generated in this manner have been measured with significant amplitudes both on the ground and in space. Other effects include the generation of field-aligned irregularities of the plasma, large-scale modification of the plasma density, and stimulated electromagnetic emissions. There is a community of researchers dedicated to understanding these effects and an annual meeting provides a forum for communicating their results.

By observing ionospheric plasma motion, a multitude of geophysical processes can be studied. These processes range from E-region plasma instabilities, to the relationships between auroral luminosity and electric fields, to the global-scale convective response to changes in the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field. Each of these areas of study contributes to the overall goals of space physics: developing an understanding of the coupling of energy from the solar wind into Earth's upper atmosphere and its effects on man or manmade systems. Currently, SuperDARN covers nearly 15 hours of local time in the northern hemisphere, and close to 12 hours in the southern hemisphere. As the network has grown and demonstrated its potential, the number of scientist working with SuperDARN data has increased annually as has the number of scientifically significant publications. Addressing many of the goals, however, requires larger-scale coverage. Specifically, the continuous monitoring of convective flows requires radar observations that circumscribe the magnetic poles. The radar proposed for South Pole Station, along with the other new radars currently being proposed by our international collaborators for other locations on the Antarctic continent, will achieve this goal in the southern hemisphere.<br/>Under the proposed program, the HF radar will be constructed Amundsen-Scott South Pole station. Data from the radar will be used, in conjunction with data from the rest of the SuperDARN network and the wealth of other space physics instruments in Antarctica, to study a variety of topics, including: responses of global convection to solar wind and IMF changes, plasma entry into, and exit from, the polar cap, and the accompanying response of the magnetotail, magnetospheric cusp response to changes in the solar wind, the motions of plasma patches through the polar cap, mesospheric winds, and thermospheric gravity waves. In addition, by establishing global-scale coverage in the southern hemisphere, the radar will help addressing questions about geomagnetic conjugacy, and the differences caused by the asymmetry of solar illumination. There are two main areas of broader impact in this proposal. First, as an international network of radars, SuperDARN fosters collaboration among member nations. There are currently eight nations that support SuperDARN work in Antarctica. It plays an important role in space physics research programs in each of these nations. The international cooperative scientific effort fostered under this program will have broad societal impacts. Another broader impact aspect of this proposal is its contribution to the education of the next generation of space physics scientists. Over the lifetime of the program, it will contribute to the education of a number of students and postdoctoral fellows.<br/><br/><br/>"

Accordingly, with involvement of indigenous peoples, Arctic and non-Arctic states have begun to develop national and international management regimes to address emerging issues, impacts and resources in the Arctic Ocean. In every case, there will be challenges to implement agreements in the face of political and financial constraints. ""Pan-Arctic Options - Holistic Integration for Arctic Coastal-Marine Sustainability"" is designed in an international, interdisciplinary and inclusive manner, involving cost-effective collaboration with currently funded projects to contribute to informed decision-making by policy makers from government and industry. The core team includes natural and social scientists from Canada, China, France, Norway, Russia and the United States who will integrate document collections, geospatial data and stakeholder perspectives. This integrated decision-support tool will involve users in the co-design and co-production of options for both policy and built elements that are needed together for sustainable infrastructure development in the Arctic Ocean. A unique observational contribution from Pan-Arctic Options will be the analysis of Automatic Identification System (AIS) data of ship traffic across the Arctic Ocean collected from polar-orbiting satellites from 2009 forward. Results will be disseminated via journals (e.g., Science, Nature) and books as well as less-conventional methods involving facilitated dialogues in annual venues (e.g., Arctic Frontiers, Arctic Circle) and in the 2016 Arctic Expedition Summit involving the National Geographic Society and Google Ocean program. Management of this holistic project will be in the hands of a Steering Committee and an international Advisory Board involving global thought leaders and organizations (e.g., Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme), contributing to Arctic Ocean sustainability on a pan-Arctic scale."

This research will develop new methods and data to measure terrestrial carbon cycling through freshwaters. This project will also train diverse students and professionals to conduct research linking terrestrial and freshwater carbon flows. Educators will complete summer research projects using environmental sensors and public datasets to enhance K-12 student understanding of research. Collaborations with industry partners will create common standards for freshwater sensor measurements. The project will also develop open-source software to improve water quality and carbon cycling research with data collected by sensors. <br/><br/>The movement of terrestrial carbon across land-water boundaries controls the carbon balance of watersheds and the metabolism of freshwater ecosystems. Streams are the primary interface between terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. They are ideal testbeds to advance understanding of land-water carbon transfers and meta-ecosystem ecology (i.e., the study of multiple ecosystems linked by energy and material transfers). This research seeks to answer the questions: (1) What is the magnitude and variability of land-to-water carbon transfers and stream carbon emissions in watershed carbon balances? (2) What controls carbon form, cycling, and fate in meta-ecosystems? (3) How does meta-ecosystem carbon cycling in different parts of the United States vary within and among years? The factors regulating carbon metabolism and emissions are predicted to operate at different spatial and temporal scales. Environmental sensors and water chemistry sampling will capture the temporal variability in carbon cycling and losses in soils and streams at paired terrestrial-aquatic National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) research sites across the United States. Project outcomes will advance a predictive understanding of the daily, seasonal, and annual processes controlling watershed carbon cycling through measurements and models that cross land-water boundaries and approaches that integrate biology, geology, and chemistry across space and time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Funds are provided to address:: 1) How should measures of fundamental properties of streams and effects of animals on those properties be scaled up to predict ecosystem characteristics of stream networks. 2) How do patterns of scaling compare across the wide array of ecological systems (from tundra to tropical forest) that occurs across North American? The SCALER experiment will be done in tropical forest, temperate mountainous forest, prairie, northern boreal evergreen forest, and tundra areas. Streams in each of these five areas will be examined at scales of centimeters to 10?s of meters in small, medium and large streams.  Rates of stream metabolism (photosynthesis and respiration) and nutrient uptake will be measured as well as the way these rates respond to animal exclusions (used to mimic loss of animal diversity in streams). These local results will be linked to the scale of watersheds and regions by modeling. Watershed scale predictions will be verified by broader, but less intensive sampling. Mechanistic explanation of how ecological measurements and experiments in streams can be scaled to watersheds will be provided. This scaling will be characterized in each of the five areas across the continent to explore how scaling differs across natural habitats.  The knowledge that will be generated by this project is essential to quantify controls on stream ecosystem processes as well as to manage human impacts on entire watersheds. The experimental and modeling results will be relevant to general ecology because few nested, and experimental and theoretically coupled scaling experiments have been undertaken in any environment. Results will inform those involved in conservation, management, and restoration of freshwater resources. Resource managers will gain a quantitative rationale and framework to link local measurements to regional patterns. The highly collaborative team will train six graduate students, five post doctoral students, and mentor three early career faculty members. Additional collaborations will be encouraged to collaborate and perform similar projects at additional sites through workshops related to the objectives and research design."

While this is a critical component of their preparation, it is an incomplete introduction to the process of doing science at sea. Most students are unfamiliar with the proposal process and the role of being chief scientist aboard a research vessel. Many students spend their time at sea performing assigned tasks without responsibility or participation in cruise planning and execution. This award is designed to complete their introduction to seagoing science by giving the students the opportunity<br/>to plan and execute a science cruise based on existing data.  In the future, this will provide an enhanced understanding of how to fully utilize expensive research vessels to the greatest extend possible.  <br/><br/>The students will do this by defining a hypothesis, planning a survey and executing the data collection to test the hypothesis. The project will address all of the scientific process through the combination of classroom instruction and experiential learning. The survey will be subject to the time constraints imposed by the ship schedule and the physical constraints imposed by the ship?s equipment.<br/>The educational process will begin with applicants responding to a request for proposals (RFP), which will provide a framework for the scientific possibilities for the cruise. The participants will meet in Dutch Harbor for two days prior to boarding the ship to refine a testable hypothesis and develop the cruise plan. During this time, the students will briefly present their responses to the RFP. The PIs will provide guidance on proposal writing, accessing existing data, and shipboard capabilities.<br/>The participants will board the ship early on the mobilization day. During this day there will be presentations on life at sea, safety and the initial introduction to the equipment on RV Sikuliaq. The students will be divided into two 12-hour watches. Once underway, each student will have the opportunity to be ""chief scientist for the day,"" making decisions about the execution of the cruise and directing participants. The other students will be assigned a particular instrument for their watch. They will be responsible for monitoring this instrument, documenting that it operates correctly and reporting significant observations to the chief scientist. Students<br/>will cycle through the instruments, so each one encounters each piece of underway gear at least once during their time at sea.<br/>The PIs will supplement the watch-standing and chief scientist experiences with presentations about the operational principles of the instruments, data reduction and interpretation, and the geology of the seabed as we transit it. These lectures will occur daily during a change of watch. The second change of watch will consist of a review of the data collected during the previous 24 hours.<br/>As the ship  approached Honolulu, the process of preparing the cruise report will begin. Each student will have a writing assignment, which contributes to the final product from the cruise, the preliminary results of their survey, and the cruise assessment."

Losses of these ""ecosystem engineers"" can have profound impacts to how ecosystems function. Coastal kelps provide excellent examples of organisms whose structure modifies the physical characteristics of their habitats (light, nutrients, water motion) and supports enhanced biodiversity.  The kelp forests in the coastal waters of the Aleutian Archipelago have suffered large-scale declines over the past several decades. This project will examine how these losses impact patterns of ecosystem production and biodiversity using a combination of techniques ranging from in situ benthic chambers and shipboard incubations to remote sensing using satellite imagery.  The results will provide an understanding of how such events may impact this and other ecosystems. This project will support graduate students and will introduce the public to the Aleutian ecosystems in a series of videos. The investigators will also work with a San Diego high school teacher to integrate project findings into classroom activities, and they expect to involve a teacher in their field program. <br/><br/>The investigators will ask two highly integrated questions: 1) How do the widespread losses of kelp forests impact benthic productivity across the Aleutian Archipelago? 2) How do the widespread losses of kelp forests impact benthic biodiversity and community structure across the archipelago? To address these, the investigators will estimate changes to productivity at ten islands where they have historic data on seaweed community composition and estimates of kelp canopy cover. They will use in situ benthic chambers placed in both kelp forests and urchin barrens to measure plot-scale patterns of net ecosystem productivity (NEP), and shipboard incubations to examine net primary productivity (NPP) for the dominant macroalgae. Data for individual species rates of NPP will be scaled by their biomass and combined with in situ plot-scale benthic chamber experiments of whole communities to estimate NEP at the islands visited. These estimates will be scaled up to calculate NEP across the entire archipelago by first extrapolating results from the study sites to entire islands, and then across the archipelago. They will also estimate broad-scale patterns in production by characterizing water column irradiances across the archipelago and modeling NPP using species-level relationships between irradiance and photosynthesis. Coupling these with estimates of water column irradiance and community respiration will allow modeling of NEP across this region. Benthic biodiversity will be assessed using diver surveys and shipboard benthic trawls. Following these activities, satellite remote sensing of the kelp canopies dating back to the 1980s and the investigators' own historical data on benthic macroalgal abundances at these and other islands will be used to estimate the temporal and spatial patterns of change across the archipelago."

When these infrastructures are vulnerable, so is society as a whole. Both the social and the engineered infrastructural systems are complex in their own right and since the systems are interconnected (coupled), the combined system is even more complex. Much of the complexity stems from the humans. <br/><br/>Infrastructural failures are often studied primarily as technical engineering matters, missing the human element. Understanding the dynamics and vulnerabilities of these coupled systems is becoming more important as the degree of coupling increases and as they are put under increasing stress. As this occurs, there is a concomitant increase in the flow of information, which can make the human element even more significant.<br/><br/>To advance understanding of the dynamics in human/infrastructure systems: <br/>1. We will investigate the dynamics of an integrated system comprised of power networks, communication networks, and a dynamic model of social interactions with these other infrastructure systems. This will build on previous work on the complex system dynamics of the individual power transmission networks, communication networks and human decision-making systems. <br/><br/>2. Simultaneously, we will develop a hierarchy of simple models to represent the key human reaction and decision-making dynamics identified in the observations of the real systems.  These will be coupled to models of the complex engineering infrastructure. <br/><br/>3. Finally we will develop tools to analyze the real systems and to quantify and predict regimes of behavior, both to understand the real systems and to assess the validity of our models. <br/>Coupled system behavior is of basic scientific interest as a problem in complex systems dynamics.  Complementing the scientific goal of improving understanding of coupled system behavior is the practical goal of developing predictive models of these systems, since their dynamics have major implications for society as a whole. The improvement in basic understanding will allow for improved risk analysis as well as the development of operational techniques to reduce the risks of major disruptions to the infrastructure.  <br/>"

The majority of fisheries in Iceland are managed under a nationwide privatized program where access to the right to fish is limited, and these limitations can negatively impact small-scale fishing operations. This project aims to better understand the opportunities and constraints that varying management schemes have on the cultural dimensions of small-scale fisheries. The economic literature that fisheries privatization is based upon assumes the primary motivation for fishing to be profit maximization. However, research from around the world suggests that a wide range of motivations for engagement in fisheries exists outside profit generation. This research compares individuals engaged in non-privatized small-boat fisheries with those participating in the small-boat privatized fisheries in a two-phase design that uses methods of semi-directed interviewing and the deployment of a questionnaire to gather qualitative and quantitative data. Results will add to new knowledge exploring the effects that the privatization of marine resources has on individuals? abilities to access marine resources. This research will also bring a new perspective to fisheries management in Iceland and abroad by providing a better understanding of the variations of motivations in fisheries and exploring the ways political and social institutions affect how humans organize around resources."

Some examples of the important role olfaction plays in human behavior include detecting the fat content of food, directing food (and possibly mate) preference, and assessing health. Human olfaction is different from our closest living ape relatives, but it is not yet known if it is similar to or distinct from our extinct hominin relatives. The fundamental issue addressed by this project is whether or not genetic variation underlying odor detection receptors in the noses of modern humans, Neandertals, and Denisovans led to differences in how each species smelled the world. The investigators will use an innovative bioinformatics and laboratory approach to uncover rebuild key components of ancient noses. On a broad scale, the project promotes progress in the science of ancient genomes and evolutionary biology by assessing gene function in extinct populations. The data generated will contribute to human evolutionary genetics, biology, and anthropology. Application of these methods to other ancient genes has potential to transform our understanding of key evolutionary changes in humans, including genes implicated in human health and disease susceptibility. Finally, the project engages in public outreach to promote science education via a variety of national and international events, and includes funding to support training and professional development for under-represented individuals in STEM disciplines. <br/><br/>This EAGER project will investigate whether the olfactory repertoires of ancient hominins are distinct from or overlap with modern humans. Specifically, the investigators will determine if novel variants in the paleogenomes of Altai Neandertals and Denisovans resulted in distinct olfactory repertoires, using variant calling in the paleogenomes of these two hominins, reconstruction of 30 paleo-olfactory receptors via overlap extension polymerase chain reaction, and experimental validation of functional responses to odorants via a high throughput Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System. The study will be one of the first to validate function of paleogenes and the first to do so on a large number of genes related to olfaction, an understudied area of human evolution. Identifying variation in olfactory repertoires within a comparative evolutionary framework may advance our understanding of hominin dietary evolution and evolutionary ecology. The investigators introduce a method that could be used by other researchers to validate function in other paleogenes that might shed light on modern human health problems, using paleospecies as a model (alongside others) for gene function."

However, these models lack detail concerning the GIS basal boundary condition, which is a critical control upon ice flow. They also do not take advantage of the wealth of information contained in its internal radiostratigraphy, but that could become a key component of their validation and application as predictive tools.<br/><br/>To address this need for new constraints on ice-sheet models, funds are provided to develop, validate, and analyze a new radiostratigraphic database of the GIS. The database will be derived from past (e.g., PARCA, CReSIS) and ongoing (e.g., IceBridge) airborne radar-sounding campaigns. The research objectives are three-fold:<br/>1. Development of novel automated layer-picking techniques. Picking widespread layers in radar data is often a time-intensive process. Recent advances permit dramatic improvements in automated layer picking, which will yield both insights into the nature of ice-sheet radiostratigraphy and accelerate a more precise study of ice-flow history from it.<br/>2. Holocene surface and basal mass balance of the GIS. The picked radiostratigraphy will be combined with strain-rate modeling to map both Holocene surface-accumulation and basal melt rates across the GIS. This proven method will be extended beyond its previous application to northern Greenland, with uncertainties quantified using their knowledge of past ice-flow conditions. This study will both inform understanding of Greenland?s subglacial geology and provide key boundary conditions for ice-flow models of the GIS.<br/>3. LAYERMAP: A dated radiostratigraphic model of the GIS. The radiostratigraphic database will be gridded in a manner similar to that for bed elevation underneath ice sheets. LAYERMAP will contribute to the advancement of IPCC-level ice-sheet models of the GIS, whose projections of its future evolution will hinge on data validation of its modern state. In addition, LAYERMAP will provide a means of mapping basal conditions and englacial drainage features across the GIS.<br/><br/>Observations suggest a recent acceleration of the contribution of a degrading Greenland Ice Sheet to global sea level rise.  Present projections of the rate of sea level rise are bounded by broad error bars, preventing accurate assessment of the response necessary to mitigate the impact of sea level rise.  This project will develop data sets needed to validate and constrain models of the Greenland Ice Sheets contribution to future sea level."

In addition to this study, NSF is also supporting a seismological survey of the GSM under award number 0537371. Major international partners in the project include Germany, China, Australia, and the United Kingdom. For more information see IPY Project #67 at IPY.org. In terms of broader impacts, this project also supports postdoctoral and graduate student research, and various forms of outreach including a focus on groups underrepresented in the earth sciences.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>"

Experiments using both single crystal substrates and nanoparticle composites of hematite will be used to determine reactivity trends with respect to adsorption of contaminant metal ions, and how these vary with surface orientation, surface quality, and reaction with ""surface modifying species"". The complementary nature of the proposed techniques will allow multiple avenues of investigation to be pursued in a coherent and synergistic effort and will result in a better understanding of the systems under investigation as compared with decoupled, independent studies. The proposed methodology also overcomes current limitations on in-situ surface structural studies of nanoscale particles by taking full advantage of recent advances in synchrotron-based surface structural techniques and periodic ab-initio methods. One of the main contributions of this work will be to explain reactivity trends in terms of molecular scale surface structure and nanoscale surface topography/defect density. This will allow the important question of scaling to be addressed since the effects of surface defects on reactivity are anticipated to increase dramatically as particle size decreases to the nanometer scale. This research team is particularly well qualified for an interdisciplinary collaboration aimed at obtaining fundamental information on mineral surface structure and reactivity relevant to the environmental interface chemistry.<br/>Broader impacts of the proposed activity: Chemical processes at nanoscale solid/aqueous solution interfaces have far-reaching impacts in environmental chemistry and geochemistry, as well as in various areas of technology that depend on surface reactions, such as heterogeneous catalysis and corrosion control. The work proposed here will lead to improved predictions about metal ion sequestration on (and release from) mineral surfaces, which will ultimately lead to improvements in quantitative models used for assessment of contaminant risk and the design of contaminant remediation strategies. While pursing the technical goals of this project, a major emphasis will be placed on providing educational opportunities to undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students. Student participants will be involved in all aspects of this project, thereby providing research experience in synchrotron-based experimentation, ab-initio electronic structure calculations, and analytical laboratory practices. Thus one of the main impacts of this project will be to produce the next generation of scientists, including women and minorities, who are well trained in the theory and techniques of molecular environmental science, which is highly interdisciplinary and presents major challenges in terms of understanding fundamental chemical processes due to the complexity of environmental systems. Additional educational impact of this work will be reflected in the development of facilities and expertise at the member institutions and by dissemination of results to the broader scientific and general community through peer reviewed publications and presentations."

Fjords (long, narrow, deep inlets of the sea between high cliffs) along the central coast of the Peninsula appear to be intense, potentially climate sensitive, hotspots of biological production and biodiversity, yet the structure and dynamics of these fjord ecosystems are very poorly understood. Because of this intense biological activity and the charismatic fauna it supports, these fjords are also major destinations for a large Antarctic tourism industry. This project is an integrated field and modeling program to evaluate physical oceanographic processes, glacial inputs, water column community dynamics, and seafloor bottom community structure and function in these important yet little understood fjord systems. These Antarctic fjords have characteristics that are substantially different from well-studied Arctic fjords, likely yielding much different responses to climate warming. This project will provide major new insights into the dynamics and climate sensitivity of Antarctic fjord ecosystems, highlighting contrasts with Arctic sub-polar fjords, and potentially transforming our understanding of the ecological role of fjords in the rapidly warming west Antarctic coastal marine landscape. The project will also further the NSF goal of training new generations of scientists, providing scientific training for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students. This includes the unique educational opportunity for undergraduates to participate in research cruises in Antarctica and the development of a novel summer graduate course on fjord ecosystems. Internet based outreach activities will be enhanced and extended by the participation of a professional photographer who will produce magazine articles, websites, radio broadcasts, and other forms of public outreach on the fascinating Antarctic ecosystem. <br/><br/>This project will involve a 15-month field program to test mechanistic hypotheses concerning oceanographic and glaciological forcing, and phytoplankton and benthic community response in the Antarctic fjords. Those efforts will be followed by a coupled physical/biological modeling effort to evaluate the drivers of biogeochemical cycles in the fjords and to explore their potential sensitivity to enhanced meltwater and sediment inputs. Fieldwork over two oceanographic cruises will utilize moorings, weather stations, and glacial, sea-ice and seafloor time-lapse cameras to obtain an integrated view of fjord ecosystem processes. The field team will also make multiple shipboard measurements and will use towed and autonomous underwater vehicles to intensively evaluate fjord ecosystem structure and function during spring/summer and autumn seasons. These integrated field and modeling studies are expected to elucidate fundamental properties of water column and sea bottom ecosystem structure and function in the fjords, and to identify key physical-chemical-glaciological forcing in these rapidly warming ecosystems."

Synthesizing perspectives on social-environmental challenges in the context of place-based and problem-focused research promises progress in solving problems that cannot be achieved by separate disciplines working in relative isolation. The arts and humanities, and the numerous subdisciplines included in these generalized disciplinary headings, will offer a productive source of ideas and approaches to the grand challenges of this era. The workshop is risky; many of the proposed participants have never worked together before. A strategic agenda will guide the 3-day workshop and clear goals are identified. These include the outlines of a common research agenda, a roadmap for future activities to achieve this agenda, and co-authorship of manuscripts.  The workshop will be held at the Nevada Museum of Art - Center for Art and the Environment and attended by 25-30 individuals who will chart a new frontier that directly implements the Memorandum of Understanding recently signed by the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities."

One of the most widespread and ecologically important types of these mutualisms in nature are associations between fungi in the soil and the roots of plants, known as mycorrhizae (fungus-roots): the fungus exports mineral nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen to the plant and the plant exports sources of energy based on carbon to the fungus.  However, as in other types of exchanges, the actual net benefits to each partner in these associations can depend upon the current costs of exports and value of imports. The associations may even grade into parasitism of one partner on the other and fall apart when, for example, a rise in the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil makes export from the fungus superfluous to the plant. One difficulty in understanding and predicting when resource exchanges between organisms will be truly beneficial is the problem of comparing apples to oranges: how does one compare the cost of exporting one element, such as carbon, to the benefit of importing a different one, such as nitrogen or phosphorus? This project will try to solve this problem by using economic models to calculate a ""price of resource exchange"" between species. Laboratory experiments will measure resource exchange prices between the Monterey pine and eight of its mycorrhizal fungi and show how those prices vary over time, as abundances of the resources change, and between the species of fungi.  This will test whether scientists can use economics to understand and predict the interactions between species as different as fungi and plants.<br/><br/>The project will also help us understand how economically important trees such as the pine respond to changes in soil fertility, and help us more accurately model global cycles of elements such as carbon and nitrogren. In addition, the project will train graduate and undergraduate students from groups that are under-represented in science, and work with teachers in two local high schools to teach younger students about the vital role of fungi in the soil, through a field trip and a year-long experiment right in the classroom."

When these species inflict damage on human resources, their population ""explosions"" become a practical concern. It is often difficult to study populations when they are very small because individuals are so rare and hard to find. Yet, understanding what keeps a species rare and what happens to shift populations into periods of rapid growth is important for predicting and controlling outbreaks of many kinds. This research examines possible reasons for dramatic cycles of abundance in the aspen leaf miner, a tiny species of moth that is usually rare but can outbreak and cause extensive damage to aspen trees. In particular, investigators will test whether females in small populations are unable to mate as often and lay as many eggs as females in large populations.  If confirmed, low mating success in small populations may be important in controlling other forest pests and slowing the spread of invasive species. <br/><br/>Due to its high level of polyandry and sustained low and high population phases, the aspen leaf miner (Phyllocnistis populiella) feeding on quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) provides an excellent system for exploring potential demographic impacts of mate-finding Allee effects on large amplitude population fluctuations. This project will use a combination of experimental and observational approaches to address whether mate-finding Allee effects and polyandry contribute to sustaining low phases of the aspen leaf miner. Specifically it will employ: 1) mating experiments to examine whether multiple mating increases female fecundity, and 2) observational studies across populations with varying densities to address whether potential and realized polyandry increases with population density. A better understanding of the mechanisms keeping populations at low density or releasing them into growth phases will aid predictions of where and when outbreaks are likely to occur."

These include extreme swings in weather and daylight hours and the isolation of many Arctic communities from the main transport network and electrical grid. As a result, islanded communities are especially vulnerable to fluctuations and disruptions in supplies of food, energy, and water. Short growing seasons make agriculture difficult, water pollutants and hygiene are constant concerns, and imported energy costs are exorbitant. In addition, the local renewable energy sources are sporadic in nature and difficult to maintain. These issues make it incumbent upon the research community and the nation to find ways to improve the stability, efficiency, and affordability in all three areas of the nexus for islanded communities. The growing emphasis on the food-energy-water nexus has yet to be extended to islanded communities, making these areas both a crucial and fertile area for examination and research. Furthermore, the self-contained nature of these communities makes them excellent places to examine the FEW nexus as a relatively closed system. The workshop is organized around three areas: 1.

From the examination of these hypotheses, new mechanisms will be derived and old ones re-evaluated. Existing numerical models will be used to assess the relative importance of these mechanisms. Existing conceptual models will be tested, and new conceptual models of carbon and energy flow will be developed. Such a study of the eastern Bering Sea shelf ecosystem is timely. Some of the most direct effects of changing climate will be on sea-ice - its extent, duration, timing of retreat, and inter-annual variability. Sea ice in turn controls ocean temperature/salinity, timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom and thus the extent of export/remineralization of fixed carbon. Crustacean zooplankton can be a choke-point in the flow of carbon and energy through the food chain.<br/><br/>The Bering Sea ecosystem provides roughly half the commercial seafood landings in the United States, as well as significant resources for subsistence fishermen.

Thwaites and neighboring glaciers in the Amundsen Sea Embayment are rapidly losing mass in response to recent climate warming and related changes in ocean circulation. Mass loss from the Amundsen Sea Embayment could lead to the eventual collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, raising the global sea level by up to 2.5 meters (8 feet) in as short as 500 years. The processes driving the loss appear to be warmer ocean circulation and changes in the width and flow speed of the glacier, but a better understanding of these changes is needed to refine predictions of how the glacier will evolve. One highly sensitive process is the transitional flow of glacier ice from land onto the ocean to become a floating ice shelf. This flow of ice from grounded to floating is affected by changes in air temperature and snowfall at the surface; the speed and thickness of ice feeding it from upstream; and the ocean temperature, salinity, bathymetry, and currents that the ice flows into. The project team will gather new measurements of each of these local environmental conditions so that it can better predict how future changes in air, ocean, or the ice will affect the loss of ice to the ocean in this region.  <br/>  <br/>Current and anticipated near-future mass loss from Thwaites Glacier and nearby Amundsen Sea Embayment region is mainly attributed to reduction in ice-shelf buttressing due to sub-ice-shelf melting by intrusion of relatively warm Circumpolar Deep Water into sub-ice-shelf cavities. Such predictions for mass loss, however, still lack understanding of the dominant processes at and near grounding zones, especially their spatial and temporal variability, as well as atmospheric and oceanic drivers of these processes. This project aims to constrain and compare these processes for the Thwaites and the Dotson Ice Shelves, which are connected through upstream ice dynamics, but influenced by different submarine troughs. The team's specific objectives are to: 1) install atmosphere-ice-ocean multi-sensor remote autonomous stations on the ice shelves for two years to provide sub-daily continuous observations of concurrent oceanic, glaciologic, and atmospheric conditions; 2) measure ocean properties on the continental shelf adjacent to ice-shelf fronts (using seal tagging, glider-based and ship-based surveys, and existing moored and conductivity-temperature-depth-cast data), 3) measure ocean properties into sub-ice-shelf cavities (using autonomous underwater vehicles) to detail ocean transports and heat fluxes; and 4) constrain current ice-shelf and sub-ice-shelf cavity geometry, ice flow, and firn properties for the ice-shelves (using radar, active-source seismic, and gravimetric methods) to better understand the impact of ocean and atmosphere on the ice-sheet change.  The team will also engage the public and bring awareness to this rapidly changing component of the cryosphere through a ""Live from the Ice"" social media campaign in which the public can follow the action and data collection from the perspective of tagged seals and autonomous stations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed work leverages and extends a substantive oceanographic investigation established as part of a Greenlandic-Danish IPY initiative, FRESHLINK, which attempts to assess the freshwater balance of the Godthåbsfjorden drainage in southwestern Greenland. This proposal adds tightly integrated glacier and inner-fjord components to this multidisciplinary effort. The specific goals are to 1) establish observations of glacier flow variability and patterns of change of the main glacier entering the fjord and quantify ice discharge on seasonal and annual time scales and relate these to fjord and off-shore oceanographic measurements; 2) quantify submarine melting at the calving terminus as a function of water temperature and glacial freshwater discharge; and 3) compare these results to other outlets and assess the implications for glacier-ice/ocean interaction on the scale of Greenland. The underlying assumption, that oceanographic forcing controls aspects of outlet glacier flow, is suggested in many areas of Greenland. Understanding recent outlet glacier retreat requires a study of the entire glacier-fjord-open ocean system. Such an integrated approach is the goal of this proposal. The combination of detailed seasonally-distributed oceanographic transects with measurements from moorings will allow quantification of marine melting of glacier ice as well as subglacial discharge. The suite of glaciological measurements will quantify the response of the glacier system as well as constrain surface melting. The satellite time series of the system, analyzed with the goal of finding remotely measurable characteristics that scale with the processes measured in situ, may allow extension to other fjords around Greenland."

In common with other national initiatives in the International GEOTRACES Program, the goals of the U.S. Arctic expedition are to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions. Some trace elements are essential to life, others are known biological toxins, and still others are important because they can be used as tracers of a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the sea. Lead is an important substance to measure because it is a toxic trace element, ranked 2nd in the US Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry, and can be utilized as a tracer of ocean processes. The study will provide for the training and support of graduate and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>Lead (Pb) is emitted into the atmosphere by high temperature industrial activities and leaded gasoline consumption and is globally dispersed by the atmosphere. High concentrations of Pb have been observed in Arctic ice cores and aerosols, and there are significant concerns about Pb, mercury, and other toxic trace elements in Arctic ecosystems. However, there remain significant questions about how these toxic trace elements and their isotopes currently exist in the Arctic, as well as how they will change in the future Arctic as a result of retreating summer sea ice and extensive drilling, mining, and industrialization. This proposal is aimed at remedying this deficiency in scientific knowledge by measuring Pb and Pb isotopes from seawater profiles, sea ice/seawater interface, snow and aerosols that will be collected during the U.S. GEOTRACES western Arctic transect.  Specifically, researchers will gain knowledge on 1) the penetration of anthropogenic lead into the Arctic Ocean, 2) the primary sources of lead to surface waters, 3) the distributions of lead and their relation to scavenging processes and rates, 4) how the exchange with sinking particles contributes to lead?s distribution, and 5) ocean circulation in the Arctic using lead as a tracer. Results from the study will have important implications for human health by increasing understanding of the distribution and abundance of a toxic trace element."

Therefore, funds are provided to elucidate how the ocean?s response to variable atmospheric forcing affects the distribution of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) eggs and larvae on the eastern Bering Sea shelf. The proposed approach builds on advances made under the BEST-BSIERP program and will use a combination of new modeling results and recent observations to examine historical dispersal pathways of pollock eggs and larvae and will simulate how these might change in the future under various scenarios.<br/><br/>Advection, the transport of material or a property by the movement of a fluid, plays a major role in the life cycle of many fish populations because early life history stages depend on quasi-passive transport from spawning areas to suitable nursery grounds. Drift trajectories of eggs and larvae and the physical and biological conditions they encounter during the first few months after spawning are highly variable and are linked to regional and broad-scale climate conditions. Thus atmospheric and oceanographic variability affects the survival of early life stages and the resulting year class strength of fish populations, such as walleye Pollock, on the eastern Bering shelf.  The results of this project will improve our understanding of the interactions of physical and biological processes on walleye Pollock and, consequently, lead to better management of this important fishery."

This conference will provide an opportunity for US-based scientists to interact with colleagues from around the world to develop Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) models. Determining the mass balance trend and fluctuations of the Earth's cryosphere in a warming climate is a topic of great interest in the Earth and environmental sciences communities.  Present day measurements of changes in the cryosphere do not uniquely constrain the present-day mass balance, because of the long-lasting effects of past mass changes - GIA.  GIA is caused by the combined elastic and viscoelastic responses of rock beneath glaciers and ice sheets. Developing these GIA models requires accounting for the mass load history and the physical properties of the earth, integrating glaciology, geodesy and seismology through numerical modeling over a variety of timescales, from the elastic response to the viscoelastic response over decades to centuries to millennia. Results from theses studies are needed for understanding postseismic deformation after earthquakes and reconciling the response of the cryosphere and sea level to climate change.  <br/><br/>This proposal will support the participation of US-based scientists, especially early career scientists, in a focused international conference. They will have the opportunity to present their work and interact with global experts in their related fields.

Where this deformation occurs within the Plateau is still mostly unknown, as are the basic physical mechanisms driving it.  The work supported by this funding intends to attack both of these mysteries by improving mathematical models of crustal deformation to include edge and surface effects hypothesized for the Himalayan boundary, and by making direct measurements of the velocities of remote parts of Tibet using GPS geodesy.  Existing models of Tibetan dynamics have not yet addressed the development of the shape of the Himalayan arc.  Existing maps of observed Tibetan surface velocities are still mostly blank.  It is currently impossible to differentiate among competing hypotheses of how Tibet grows and moves based on predictions of surface motions or of geographic shapes."

GPS observations of postseismic transients after large subduction earthquakes provide a natural experiment to study rheology of the megathrust and of the sublithospheric mantle. Scientists still disagree on what mechanism prevails in the postseismic transients: frictional afterslip on the coseismic rupture, viscoelastic relaxation in the asthenosphere, or poroelastic rebound. In 2006-2007, a doublet of great earthquakes (Mw > 8) struck in the center of the Kuril subduction zone at the northwest Pacific Ocean: a thrust event at the subduction interface followed by an extensional event beneath the oceanward flank of the Kuril trench. It is probably the greatest doublet that has been observed in the era of satellite geodesy and broadband seismology. In 2006, the Kuril GPS Array was installed, which allowed to measure all components of the earthquake cycle. The data collected in 2006-2009 before and after the 2006-2007 earthquakes outlined a broad zone of postseismic deformation with initial horizontal velocities as fast as 100 mm/a, and a regional uplift. Most of the postseismic signal after the great Kuril doublet is caused by the viscoelastic relaxation of shear stresses in the weak asthenosphere. Viscoelastic relaxation was discriminated from other candidate mechanisms by the pattern of horizontal and vertical motions. We predict that the postseismic deformation will die out in about a decade after the earthquake doublet, so the preferred mechanism can be tested with observations continued for several years. Our initial results suggest large variations among subduction zones in the upper mantle viscosity, one of the most important parameters that governs the stress distribution.<br/><br/>The focus of work during this 1-year proposal period will be to: (1) Guarantee continuity of the postseismic time series, without which all future work would be handicapped. (2) Analyze and develop models of postseismic transient deformation for a period 4?5 years after the great 2006?2007 Kuril earthquakes, revisiting or testing several assumptions made in the work so far. (3) Compare and assess geodetic and seismologic models for the two events, and include the effect of the outer rise event in models. (4) Map the space-time distribution of frictional afterslip, and in particular study how stress changes from the second event affected ongoing afterslip. (5) Model the deformation caused by the eruption of Sarychev volcano (Matua Island in the central Kurils).<br/><br/>The project continues collaboration between the scientists of the US and Russia. The results of the project will have an impact on the region subject to disastrous earthquakes. This work and the methods we will develop are expected to lead to generally improved understanding of the earthquake potential of subduction zones and may thus ultimately lead to improved hazard estimation and mitigation elsewhere."

How does MCOG influence physical and biogeochemical tracers that have fluxes between ice and ocean? How much can MCOG reduce uncertainties in climate models?

In nutritional physiology, for example, researchers are only starting to appreciate the complexity of how animals meet requirements for essential amino acids and fatty acids, and how meeting those requirements can generate physiological interdependency.  In arctic ecosystems, amino acids are a key source of nitrogen for boreal plant communities, but how they are supplied to soil is unclear.  Nutritional associations between plants and root-fungi (mycorrhizae) are common, but the details of nutrient exchange between the partners are not well known.  In all these cases, progress is limited by the available tools for tracing nutrient exchange.  This research develops a new approach to tracing amino acid biosynthetic sources, using the variation generated by organismal metabolism in the carbon isotopic signatures of amino acids. These suites of isotopic signatures can be thought of as a biosynthetic ""fingerprint,"" and these fingerprints may be diagnostic of the type of organism that produced them.  The proposed research will characterize the amino acid isotopic fingerprints of select microorganisms, plants, and fungi.  These organisms can synthesize de novo all twenty amino acids found in proteins, and potentially supply amino acids to animals, soil nutrient pools, or symbiotic partners.  If these fingerprints prove to be robust, reproducible indicators of biosynthetic sources, they would transform the ability of researchers to address questions about nutrient flow in natural systems that cannot be answered with present technology. Such a tool will be of great interest to scientists studying physiological ecology, evolutionary ecology, plant-insect interactions, plant biology, ecosystem ecology, and biogeochemistry.  The analyses used to measure isotope signatures in amino acids are becoming increasingly available.  However, the lack of comparative data has contributed to a growing literature that is rife with poorly validated assumptions.  Thus, this research will significantly advance our understanding of the variability of amino acid signatures within and among organisms, and will provide the foundation for a methodology with wide ranging applicability. This research project will involve training of a graduate student in the development of this novel tool.<br/><br/>"

It is leveraging the power of modeling technology (COLLADA and GigaPan) and virtual globes such as Google Earth. A project-related Penrose professional conference at Google Headquarters is enabling a paradigm-shift among a cohort of academic experts and research assistants who are designing, developing, and implementing innovative virtual field trips.  The virtual field trips are allowing geoscience students to act as free-agent learners guided by distributed teacher networks. The project is enabling students to explore a geoscience-enhanced Google Earth experience using models or ""avatars"" to represent themselves and their field vehicles. The virtual terrain is peppered with computer-generated rock outcrops and rock specimens that students are discovering and collecting as they solve problems as virtual detectives. The virtual activities are enabling students to lift and examine specimens, and allowing them to perform virtual physical and chemical analyses that are helping to guide their field mapping decisions. In addition to traditional field destinations, the project is providing a mechanism that allows students to visit and examine virtual places where real field trips cannot take them, including the vents of active volcanoes and the deepest ocean trenches. Students are playing the roles of first-responders in natural disaster scenarios and are exploring Paleo-Google Earths that correspond to a number of past geologic periods, thus expanding their appreciation and understanding of ""deep time"". The project is also enabling students to virtually explore the past and present environments of the Moon and Mars.  Strong formative evaluation components are embedded throughout the project and are informing its development.  A key feature guiding the development of the project is the use of technology to track students' actions and to log and scaffold their virtual field activities. By analyzing their actions and - by comparing of novice versus expert tracks - the project is assessing, in real time, the potential of each exercise to improve student learning while also providing instant feedback, encouragement, and guidance to the students."

It combines future climate projections, remote sensing and hydrological data together with hydrological, geophysical, agroecosystem and economic modeling to characterize the relative importance of local precipitation, runoff, groundwater mining, interbasin water transfers, and agricultural and non-agricultural water use for the region's water supply-demand balance.  The project goal is to estimate how effects of climate change on high-elevation snow, ice, and permafrost hydrology will affect downstream water resources and food production, and through scenario analyses with regard to e.g. dam construction and other large-scale water engineering efforts. <br/><br/>The project is assessing current and projected water resources in the watersheds of the major rivers draining from the Asian High Mountains (principally the Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Salween, Mekong, Yangtze, Yellow, Amu Darya, Syr Darya, and Irtysh Rivers), with a particular focus on the climatic change and variability impacts on runoff from the highlands. Irrigated agriculture is widespread in the study region, and water resources are tightly linked to food supplies.  Agricultural economies support the majority of the regional population, so water and food resources are a key factor in the regional economy.  This project is linking water supply and potential food production to an economic model, enabling assessment of water use, cropping intensity and yields in each of the various crop production sectors of the economy. The project is characterizing the response of downstream water demand and agricultural production to increased population, economic activity expansion and constrained water supplies, and assessing the implications of improvements in irrigation and crop water use efficiency, proposed major interbasin water transfer projects and dam construction, and deep groundwater depletion for food security and trade in the region's economies.  Simulation uncertainties are assessed by sensitivity analyses driven by uncertainties in both model parameters and agricultural and hydrological databases. The project has collaborative ties with researchers in several countries in the study region, and they are contributing to efforts to obtain relevant data on regional land and water use.<br/>Water and food security in Asia in the face of climate change and rising populations is an issue of global importance. Much of the study region is already experiencing physical or economic water scarcity, and major water engineering works are planned in both India and China. This broadly interdisciplinary project (geosciences, agricultural sciences, social sciences) is quantifying contemporary water resources, water use for agriculture, and food production, and the economic consequences of future climate change on water and food prices in the study region.  Knowledge gained in this study will improve the capacity of integrated assessment modeling to account for the physical constraints of water resources on future economic and social activity, and mitigation and adaptation strategies. This project includes graduate student education & training and undergraduate research opportunities. In addition, the project is developing learning modules on global change in Asia, with a focus on water and food resources and sustainability, for an NSF-sponsored K-12 global change education outreach program.  The project is contributing to stronger and deeper international collaborations with researchers in Asia.  Finally, the project is contributing to the global change research community's capacity to integrate physical and social sciences, which is essential to address the broadly interdisciplinary issue of water, climate, and sustainability."

Though seismology remains one of the primary tools for tracking and understanding volcanic behavior, this fact is responsible for more false eruption forecasts than any other. Non-eruptive earthquake swarms at volcanoes have caused countless false alarms, economic impacts, and community responses. By addressing eruptive and non-eruptive earthquake swarm characteristics, this project attacks one of the fundamental challenges in volcano science. We will improve capabilities for interpreting the numerous sources of volcanic earthquake swarms by characterizing them with simple, but quantitatively repeatable, parameters. Funds will be used almost exclusively to support a post doctoral researcher.<br/><br/>Objective 1: Quantify the defining characteristics of volcanic earthquake swarm mechanisms. Comparisons between volcanic swarms have historically been challenging because each swarm has been studied with a custom technique. We plan to reanalyze swarms from a wide suite of volcanoes using a uniform methodology. Beginning with the original continuous seismic records, automated techniques will be used to create new earthquake catalogs that span the swarms of interest. Using the new catalogs, a suite of quantitative parameters will be derived based on rates, magnitudes, and waveform characteristics. Principal component analysis of the parameter space, paired with traditional and Bayesian hypothesis testing, will be used to identify the defining characteristics of each swarm mechanism. As a byproduct of this research, earthquake swarm catalogs will be made openly available on the web as they are produced. For most of the swarms proposed here, the new catalogs will contain vastly more earthquakes than anything currently available.<br/><br/>Objective 2: Assess the eruption forecasting potential of multiplet, or repeating, earthquakes. Because multiplets imply a long-lived non-destructive source, they are particularly promising for forecasting eruptive behavior. Building on swarm characteristics derived in objective 1, swarms with significant multiplet sequences will be identified. From these multiplets many of the same parameters derived for the swarms will be calculated. Additional measures are available for multiplets that exploit their waveform similarity for source migration inferred from high-precision travel times, coda wave interferometry, and precise relative magnitudes. By distilling these phenomena to simple parameters the same parametric techniques will be applied as in objective 1. By examining sequences from numerous volcanic settings, the defining characteristics of each source type will be isolated. While this analysis will span many types of multiplets, the motivation is to assess the features that most frequently portend eruption."

Classical cytogenetic studies have demonstrated extensive diversity in the genomic characteristics of the species in this group of fishes.  This variability, coupled with emerging consensus on the evolutionary relationships of the group makes it an ideal testing ground for emerging ideas on the underlying mechanisms and consequences of evolution at the chromosome and genome levels.  The knowledge, data and materials that this project will generate will provide the foundation for broader investigations of the mode and tempo of chromosome and genome evolution in fishes, the most species-rich vertebrate lineage.  The research has two specific goals: a) to determine the characteristics of the expansion of the genome in the esociform genus Umbra; and b) to produce protocols and reagents necessary for molecular cytogenetic studies of esociforms and their closest relatives.  In the long term, these protocols may be applied to other lineages that exhibit unique features of genomic organization.  The genome of two of the three species of Umbra comprise approximately two times as much DNA as those observed in other esociform genera.  Determining the factors that contribute to this genome expansion is significant in light of the recently renewed interest in hypothesized relationships between organismal evolution and genome size.  Preliminary data point to the amplification of some transposable element (TE) populations as a primary force leading to genome expansion in Umbra.  The current project is designed to test that hypothesis using several complementary lines of evidence.  Southern and dot blot experiments will reveal the relative contributions of different genomic components to genome expansion.  Deep sequencing of PCR-targeted cloning experiments and phylogenetic analyses will be used to characterize the diversity and relative age of TE populations in representative esociform genomes.  Finally, fluorescence in situ hybridization observations will help define features of any putative relationships between changes in genome size and karyotypic arrangement.  Another interesting aspect of genomic variation among esociforms is the apparent change in chromosomal stability that underlies the diversity of karyotypes in the group.  Specifically, classical cytogenetic studies and fossil evidence indicate that the karyotypes of members of the genus Esox have remained virtually unchanged for more than 60 million years; while at the other extreme, different populations of the esociform Dallia pectoralis show divergent karyotypes.  Overall, diploid chromosome numbers among esociforms range from 22 to 78.  This variability in karyotype and karyotypic stability highlights the value of the study of chromosome evolution in esociforms to uncover characteristics of the mechanisms that shape genome variation.  This project initiates the task of determining the mode and rate of chromosomal evolution in esociforms through the development and application of chromosome specific DNA probes.  This effort will also help determine the utility of cytogenetic data in fish phylogenetics.<br/>This project will examine processes that shape genetic variability at the scale of chromosomes and genomes.  The research focuses on one group of fishes that is known to possess extensive and interesting diversity in their chromosomal and genomic characteristics.  The insights gained from this work will lead to increased understanding of the mechanisms that are responsible for generating some of the genetic diversity that characterizes life and that constitutes the fuel for biological evolution.  This research will help foster the professional development of a beginning investigator who is a member of a group underrepresented in science and a graduate student, who will gain hands-on experience with a set of scientific tools that currently are not in widespread use among evolutionary biologists in the U.S.  Thanks to the investigator's affiliation with a natural history museum and his participation in its educational activities, the project's results will be made promptly and conveniently available to the general public.<br/>"

We use an adjoint-based tomographic inversion technique that relies on highly accurate, three-dimensional seismic wavefield simulations. The study has the following three components: (1) simulations of synthetic seismograms in realistic, complex 3D fault zone models, including clarifying the allowable ranges of geometrical and material variations that produce the observed characteristics of recorded head and trapped waves; (2) analysis of volumetric sensitivities of various fault zone, body, and surface phases to key fault zone structures at depth; (3) iterative adjoint tomographic inversions for the structures of the San Andreas fault near Parkfield and different sections of the San Jacinto fault zone.<br/><br/>Large damaging earthquakes originate on faults kilometers below Earth's surface. A detailed characterization of the physical setting where earthquakes nucleate and rupture has not yet been achieved. By modeling seismic waves that are particularly sensitive to the structures of fault zones, we can image the subsurface structure of fault zones. The basic difficulty in imaging fault zones stems from their multi-scale and strong variations in structure, which are evident at the surface and within boreholes. By using accurate seismic wave propagation models, the study will provide the most detailed description of fault zone structure afforded by the recorded data.

Network-like structures play a fundamental role in many problems of science and engineering. The classical problem here comes from oscillations of flexible structures made of strings, beams, cables, and struts. The models describe bridges, space-structures, antennas, transmission-line posts, steel-grid reinforcements and other typical objects of civil engineering. More recently, applications on a much smaller scale have come into focus. In particular, hierarchical materials like ceramic or metallic foams, percolation networks and carbon and grapheme nano-tubes have attracted much attention. Quantum graphs arise as natural models of various phenomena in chemistry (free-electron theory of conjugated molecules), biology (genetic networks, dendritic trees), geophysics, environmental science, decease control, and are even relevant in connection with the  Internet (Internet or network tomography). Control and inverse theories for quantum graphs constitute an important part of the rapidly developing area of applied mathematics --- analysis on graphs. They are tremendously important for all aforementioned applications. The main goal of the proposed research is to develop new methods and approaches to these theories.<br/><br/>Recently a new effective leaf-peeling method has been developed by the PI and his collaborators for solving inverse problems for differential equations on trees (graphs without cycles). The project will extend this method to general graphs which include trees and graphs with cycles.  We will focus on inverse problems for differential equations that are important for applications in science and engineering. Along with unknown coefficients of the equations on the edges, the topology of the graph and geometrical parameters (the lengths of the edges and, in relevant cases, the angles between neighboring edges) will be recovered. Exact controllability of the corresponding dynamical systems on graphs with cycles will also be established. The leaf-peeling method is based on the Boundary Control method for inverse problems of mathematical physics. The characteristic feature of these methods is their locality: recovering the topology and other parameters of a subgraph requires only the data related to that subgraph. This property gives the leaf-peeling method an advantage over other methods and allows to extend our approach to graphs with cycles."

For reasons that are not currently known, the antarctic  interior experiences more frequent and better developed halos than  any other location on Earth.  The objectives of the project are to  observe natural halos at South Pole Station and to sample ice  crystals in order to validate computer models of light refraction  and reflection in ice crystals.  Such models have the potential for  the remote sensing of atmospheric conditions.  Controlled  experiments, such as seeding the atmosphere with dry ice, will  produce artificially generated, but simple and well-formed single-  species crystals.    The project provides a unique mechanism for examining the crystal  growth and evolution process in the natural atmosphere; the  observation of halos through polarizing filters will also allow an  examination of the atmospheric ice crystal orientation, shape, and  size.  It will advance our understanding of the reasons for the  growth of well-formed ice crystals, which is a characteristic of  the antarctic atmosphere, but is not generally observed elsewhere.  ***"

The degree of non-linearity in the magnetospheric response to the  solar wind is controlled by the level of magnetospheric activity.   Our primary interest in predictability is for the identification of  deterministic non-linear response; our interest in predictability  qua prediction is secondary to that.  To continue our previous non-  linear analysis, we will analyse the response of the magnetosphere  (as given by the 11 auroral oval magnetometer station records) to  the solar wind input (given by the parameters v, n, B and  calculated from 1 minute resolution ISEE-3 data).  We should be  able to identify the solar wind parameters which have the most  effect on the magnetosphere and the prevailing pattern of response  of the magnetosphere, as observed by the ground station  magnetometers.  Physically, it is likely that the present auroral  electroject indices cannot reveal significant dynamical information  about electroject dynamics.  We will use the results of this non-  linear prediction study to propose a new index based on the data  from the 11 stations which more accurately represents the solar  wind driven activity in the Earth's magnetosphere.  we will  generate the basis function whose projection leads to the least  prediction error.  ***"

Investigations will focus on describing typical bacterial species from a near-arctic freshwater system during the severe transition in primary productivity and temperature, infer the presence of key organics in their<br/>maintenance, and quantify the contribution of these mostly undescribed organisms to carbon dioxide production rates. The study site, Harding Lake, is known to have a relatively stable bacterial biomass over the annual cycle. However physical properties of the bacteria, DNA distributions, kinetic constants and associated amino acid concentrations and primary productivities vary<br/>dramatically between summer and winter.

These include recently perfected<br/>measures of population, biomass per cell, cell volume, DNA content, and genome  size by flow cytometry. A chromosome-ratio method for growth rate will be verified at low values, temperature corrections reevaluated, and the method used as a probe of in situ rates of growth with verification by dilution culture.<br/>DAPI-DNA assays will be corrected for A+T bias by simultaneously evaluating G+C content of individual bacteria, thereby improving subpopulation resolution.<br/>Additional single-cell activity probes include RNA, reducing power and membrane potential for following activity in dilution cultures and more thoroughly<br/>characterizing in situ populations over the annual cycle. Extinction cultures<br/>that depend on naturally produced sources of carbon are used to isolate bacteria<br/>without bias toward large fast-growing forms. Cultures are partitioned against<br/>raw lakewater through diffusion membranes to improve culturability. Data are<br/>used to determine viabilities as well as the number of species present by<br/>incorporating novel formulae as well as DGGE techniques to identify the number<br/>of species in developing populations. Useful carbon sources are evaluated<br/>according to flow cytometry patterns from the extinction cultures following<br/>nutrient amendments. Substrates used are taken as an indication of those present and kinetic measurements suggest their concentrations. Ability to use substrates at small concentrations is compared directly according to specific affinity and oligotrophic capacity as recently defined. Isolated species are identified by 16-S ribosomal RNA analysis, and in situ carbon dioxide evolution is calculated from growth rates according to the active (total less very low-DNA) biomass and associated rates of growth. Temperature effects on both uptake and growth are evaluated without carbon-source amendment to determine if rates at low temperatures collapse, or if sufficient membrane potential is sustained to<br/>maintain the required specific affinities.<br/><br/>"

The coastal array includes stations at Cape Denison  and Port Martin, which have recorded the highest average  surface wind speeds on the globe (a monthly average of 62  mph).  One additional automatic weather station will be  installed 15 km inland where model results predict even  higher average wind speeds.  These winds drive the sea ice  offshore, and are responsible for extremely high heat fluxes  from the ocean to the atmosphere.  Satellite-based active  microwave imagery (Synthetic Aperture Radar) will be combined  with the observed meteorological data to analyze the  formation persistence and size of offshore polynyas as a  function of wind speed.

Here the investigators propose a new concept for mass balance, the reference-surface' balance rate, which is independent of the changing geometry of a glacier.  This is a three year project with two goals:    (1)  To define and to show the importance of this new type of balance, and to determine how to measure it within the context of conventional mass balance programs.    (2)  To improve the theory of the response of a glacier or ice cap to changes in climate.    The first goal is motivated by the problem that the mass balance of a glacier depends not only upon climate, but upon the geometry of the glacier surface.  This is a serious complication in finding a connection between balance and climate.  The proposed reference-surface balance rate is directly connected with climate, and its measurement could become a part of ongoing balance programs.   The second goal is an outgrowth of preliminary work on defining the reference-surface balance rate.  It is a convenient starting point for several extensions of the theory of the response of a glacier to climate change.  It includes the effects of the dependence of mass balance upon elevation and upon the three dimensional nature of the surface.  The problems to be studied include the effects of a glacier's geometry on the stability and magnitude of its response to climate change, the effects of observed geometrical asymmetry during advance and retreat, and the possibility of deducing the reference-surface balance rate from conventional mass balance rate."

The investigators will derive a ""family tree"" of Penstemon using DNA sequences to estimate genetic similarities, so that observed changes in floral characters can be interpreted with a proper understanding of species relationships. Ecological research will be focused on ways that Penstemon anther characteristics influence size and number of pollen doses, and ultimately, plant fitness in hummingbird- and bee-pollinated plants.  An untested new theory predicts that when pollinating animals visit frequently, plants that release pollen from their anthers in smaller doses per visit will donate more pollen to other plants. As the first test of pollen presentation theory, this research will help decide whether these models are correct and useful. Improved knowledge of pollination mechanics can help improve the economic evaluation of alternative pollinators of agricultural crops."

These interactions are important because warmer air temperatures predicted in the Arctic from increases in greenhouse gases will cause permafrost to thaw as the active layer becomes thicker.  A better understanding of the linkages between the atmosphere, soil surface, active layer, and permafrost is required to answer questions regarding the rate and extent of permafrost degradation, modifications to its thermal regime, release of carbon and trace gases by thawing permafrost, changes in soil moisture, the biota, the hydrological cycle, how these changes will influence the use of polar lands, and the development, calibration, and validation of small-scale numerical models (<2 km grids) of land-atmosphere interactions that are to be nested in larger scale models.

The International Whaling Commission's                    reduction of minke whale harvests has had a considerable impact on              Greenlandic communities.  The Greenlandic situation is typical of               the conflicts between Inuit communities, and other subsistence-                 based societies in the Arctic, and the interests of environmental               protection organizations and development concerns.  Although                    critics have challenged the validity of traditional Inuit whaling               and emphasized the emergence of internal markets, the Greenlanders              argue for the cultural and socioeconomic significance of whaling                and its sustainability.

She will be exploring the regional distribution of                the neurotransmitters dopamine and gammaminobutyric acid (GABA).                Dopamine and GABA play an important role in motivation and motor                function in mammals.  Release of dopamine in mammalian forebrain                is thought to mediate the reinforcing properties of drug abuse.                 GABA is thought to relay and modulate dopaminergic messages.  She               will also be investigating what mechanisms regulate the release of              these chemical messengers.  Dr. Drew will be utilizing a newly                  developed, state of the art technique called in vivo microdialysis              to measure neurotransmitter release in awake freely moving teleost.             In vivo microdialysis has been used successfully in warm blooded                vertebrates to address previously unanswered questions regarding                neurotransmitter release.  Dr. Drew's experiments are the first to              employ the technique in the study of neurotransmitter release in                cold blooded vertebrates.  Although Dr. Drew's current research is              aimed primarily at establishing the feasibility of the technique,               it is envisioned that in the future in vivo microdialysis will be               used to study neurotransmitter release during migration and rapid               deterioration of teleosts as they journey upstream to spawn.  Such              studies would also contribute significantly to the understanding                of the role that dopamine and GABA play in the initiation and                   maintenance of compulsive behavior exhibited in some humans.//"

Because the vocal control regions regulate  a single behavior, studies on this subject offer a unique  opportunity for elucidating the neural bases of behavior.  Steroidal hormones play essential roles in this system s  sexual differentiation and in vocal behavior learning and  expression.  However, extensive research on steroid effects  has not satisfactorily explained characteristics of the  vocal control system at all stages of song development and  expression.  The investigators have observed opioids and  their receptors in vocal control regions.  In other systems  opioids modulate neuron morphology and survival, sensory  processing, and learning and memory.  In order to ascertain  whether opioids regulate any of these features of vocal  control, it is necessary to determine if any correlation  exists between vocal control system opioid activity an d  particular aspects of singing behavior.  The proposed work  will use radioimmunoassays to measure opioid concentrations  in vocal control regions microdissected from dark-eyed junco  (Junco hyemalis) brains during four stages: song template  storage, song expression, song recognition, and post-  breeding cessation of singing behavior.  Additionally, a  parallel study that will directly asses the effects of  chronic opioid antagonist administration on singing behavior  in adult male juncos will be conducted.  This project will  help direct future research on the role(s) of opioids in  controlling behavior."

The hope is that insights into the evolutionary mechanisms will                 also elucidate interspecific variability of brain organization,                 which in turn may provide structure-function correlation.  More                 importantly, the studies may elucidate what evolutionary and                    ontogenetic constraints determine what synapses are possible                    between neurons and which are not.                                                                                                                                   Since evidence about the evolution of circuitry cannot be                  obtained from fossils, Dr. Ebbesson designed an approach to                     study brain evolution 20 years ago that involves a systematic                   examination of a given neural system in the broadest possible                   spectrum of vertebrates with the hope that principles of                        evolution would emerge from the pattern of the data.  The                       initial objectives have now been reached in that the basic                      organization and variability of several sensory systems,                        including the ascending spinal and the visual systems in                        representative samples of most major vertebrate groups, are now                 known.  The many pathways discovered and described during the                   last 20 years by a number of investigations point to several                    operational evolutionary strategies.  One of these has been                     described as the parcellation theory which states that diffuse,                 undifferentiated, overlapping neural systems existed in the                     beginning of vertebrate evolution and that during evolution of                  complex behaviors, and analytical capacities related to these                   behaviors, a range of neural systems evolved, not by de novo                    appearance or one system invading another, but by a process of                  segregation and isolation (parcellation) that involves the                      formation of more isolated subcircuits by the selective loss of                 connections.  The resultant daughter systems individually lack                  one or more connections of their ancestors.  The evolutionary                   process is thought to be reflected in the normal ontogenetic                    development of a given system where a similar segregation-                      isolation process take place.  The objective of Dr. Ebbesson                    for the next three years is to test and define this theory by                   defining connections more precisely in the sensory pathways in                  species from three vertebrate classes that are likely to have                   extensive overlap of systems; i.e., unparcellated systems.                      These animals include the bowfin, the nurse shark, and the                      tiger salamander."

Large amounts of carbon are stored within the soils of terrestrial ecosystems. Recently, attention has been drawn to the thawing of permafrost (permanently frozen ground) as a mechanism that could move significant quantities of stored C from land to atmosphere in response to a changing climate.  Because of the size and nature of the permafrost C pool, decomposition of previously frozen, old organic carbon is one of the most likely positive feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to climate change in a warmer world.  <br/><br/>While ground temperature increases in permafrost regions are well documented with data from permafrost borehole networks, as well as from surface temperature observations, there is a knowledge gap surrounding the response of permafrost carbon to climate change.  This Vulnerability of Permafrost Carbon research coordination network (RCN) project will bring together biological and physical carbon cycle researchers.  Through a series of meetings, working groups will be established that will address key questions about carbon cycling and vulnerability in permafrost regions and synthesize data and literature.  An interactive website will be developed for non-scientists and the media that will synthesize the state of knowledge about permafrost.  This RCN will strengthen the interconnection between biological and physical scientists, between early and later career-stage scientists, and will produce new knowledge through synthesis that can be used to quantify the role of permafrost carbon in affecting climate change in the 21st century and beyond."

Recently, rats have been eradicated from a number of islands in an effort to restore populations of native animals.  However, rats do more than just kills animals:  they also eat plant parts (seeds, seedlings, fruit and bark) and radically change the vegetation.  Furthermore, many of the islands invaded by rats also served as nesting grounds for large colonies of seabirds, which themselves had large effects on the vegetation and soils (by digging burrows in which to lay their eggs).  This project has two goals.  First, we will examine how rats affect the vegetation and soils, and how much of this is due to changes in seabird populations.  Second, we will evaluate  to what extent islands recover from rat effects after rats are eradicated, and whether this depends seabird population sizes.  We will do this by comparing three groups of islands located off the coast of New Zealand: one which has never had rats, one which has rats, and one from which rats have been removed during the past decade.  If vegetation and soils fail to recover (or take a long time to recover) following the eradication of rats, then efforts to bring back native animal populations may not be successful without additional restoration work.  The results of this work will give a better understanding of the effects rats have and how to reverse them on islands everywhere.<br/>"

To determine whether symbiotic fungi regulate the distribution of orchids, a series of laboratory and field experiments is proposed in which orchid seeds, fungal partners, litter substrates and abiotic factors (light, water) are manipulated. To determine how substrate quality affects orchid growth, carbon sources for seedling orchids will be determined under varying substrate, water and light regimes.

Many coastal environments depend on mangrove habitats to reduce erosion, buffer the influence of hurricanes and provide habitats for marine organisms. There is concern about the response of mangroves to future sea-level rise scenarios.  However, laboratory and field experiments involving mangroves provide a limited temporal and spatial perspective of mangrove responses to environmental change. Our proposed research presents a novel approach to study past mangrove responses to environmental change throughout the Holocene (the last ~10,000 years), a period during which sea-level is known to have risen. The continuous deposits of mangrove peat present in Belize are the largest in the world and provide an exceptional resource to study past mangrove ecosystems over this period. A number of peat cores have already been collected and will be analyzed during this proposed project. We propose analyzing cores from three different sites to develop a robust picture of regional past mangrove ecology.  One core (~8 m in depth) is from Twin Cays and a second core (~8 m in depth) is from Tobacco Range. These sites are ~12 km off of the mainland coast of Belize and are therefore less liable to be influenced by mainland tropical plant species. In addition, by analyzing a core (~6 m in depth) taken from coastal mangroves on the mainland, we will be able to compare and contrast coastal and island mangrove responses to Holocene sea-level changes. Ecosystem changes will be established by studying multiple lines of evidence (multiple proxies of the past vegetation) preserved in these peat cores, which are dated using radiocarbon dating. Peat cores will be analyzed for proxies that include counts of fossil pollen to track changes in vegetation composition, together with bulk and compound specific stable isotopic (C and N) techniques that will monitor physiological changes in mangroves with time. By analyzing a suite of proxies at each site, we will be able to develop detailed histories describing important aspects of these ecosystems, including factors such as species composition, plant morphology and structure, nutrient status and availability, peat accumulation rates, and physiological stress.  By analyzing multiple sites, and multiple cores within a site, we will be able to distinguish between site-specific and regional trends, which will allow us to determine a robust assessment of overall ecosystem changes.  In turn, these data will be compared with the framework of Holocene sea-level change for the region.  We believe that our sites are among the best available to develop long-term records of mangrove ecosystems.  Ultimately, knowledge of how these ecosystems responded to past environmental change is important in assessing how tropical ecosystems will function in response to future environmental changes.<br/>"

The lack of sunlight in winter and the long daylight hours in summer control the seasonal cycle of the surface heat budget, structure both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, drive the seasonal build-up and sequestration of carbon and play a major role in the cycling of major atmospheric constituents. One of the most important aspects of the disposition of solar radiation within the Arctic system is the reflection, absorption and transmission of sunlight by the atmosphere-sea ice-ocean system (AIOS). The overall goals of this study are to enhance our understanding of the present role that solar radiation plays in the Arctic AIOS and to improve our ability to predict the future role. This will be accomplished through an integrative and synthetic approach. Data will be collected from a wide range of sources including laboratory studies, field experiments, and satellite observations. An error analysis and data gap assessment will be a central component of the synthesis activity. Process models, ice-ocean models, and reanalysis products will be used to fill the gaps in the dataset. The primary product of this synthesis effort will be a 20-year, pan-Arctic description of the interaction of solar radiation with the AIOS. In particular, we will determine spectral values from 250 to 2500 nm of the incident solar energy, the reflected solar energy, and the solar energy absorbed in the snow, sea ice, and upper ocean. Values will be computed on a monthly, pan-Arctic basis from 1987 to 2007 using the 25 x 25 km Equal Area Scalable Earth Grid. The influx of (solar) heat into the Western Arctic through Bering Strait will also be examined in detail, since the largest changes in ice extent and ice thickness have been observed in this sector of the Arctic. This proposed synthesis of solar radiation in the Arctic AIOS will contribute several key elements to the larger synthesis of the Arctic System including: an assessment of the recent changes in solar energy input to the Arctic Ocean in relation to the observed changes in ice cover and ice mass balance; an evaluation of polar amplification through the ice-albedo feedback; information on the distribution of solar energy available for driving the biological production in the under-ice and upper ocean environments; and insights into the potential changes in and impacts of solar energy distribution as predicted by climate change models. <br/>"

The physical hypothesis underlying both the proposed observational studies and the modeling/data analysis efforts is that sea ice cover must be considered an intrinsic part of the oceanic boundary layer in models rather than a separate entity only transferring stress at the interface.  This project will deploy two autonomous buoy arrays, as part of a collaborative ice-based observing system, to monitor mesoscale sea ice deformation in the East Siberian Sea and Beaufort Sea for one year.  Evolution of sea ice thickness distribution at both drifting stations will be investigated, resolving both dynamic and thermodynamic processes.  The study will elucidate the role of high frequency deformation in ocean-atmosphere fluxes, salt fluxes to the ocean, and ice mass balance.  Coordination of observations with ice-ocean tidal-inertial modeling will provide insight into how nonlinear ice mechanics effects ice-ocean coupling and tidal characteristics.  The principal investigators are developing a barotropic ice-ocean model including an upper ocean boundary layer with imbedded sea ice so that net Ekman transport in the upper ocean includes both ice and water.  The focus of the modeling effort is on a detailed comparison with observations."

Measurements will include artificial warming and cooling to determine activation energies from which temperature preferences are evaluated.

The distribution of cell mass and DNA/cell is used as a further index of organism activity over the seasons.

These are linked to dissolved free amino acid concentrations as an indication of labile organic substrates. Further characterization will be by DNA fragment and sequence analyses. <br/><br/>Existing culture collections of isolates will be further developed with the objective of finding and characterizing a typical low DNA, small, typical freshwater oligobacterium for physiological study.

Expanded statistical theory for testing cell-cell interactions will be applied with the objective of improving the small (1%) culturability presently attained. <br/><br/>This work involves the application of novel theory and methods to the understanding of microbial processes in the Arctic with particular reference to seasonal changes in water temperature. These will serve to improve estimates of bacterial activity and productivity. Novel extinction culture procedures coupled with new statistical and kinetic theory can help solidify the sparse understanding of one of our largest forms of active living material. Developing kinetic theory is beginning to alter paradigms, as is quantitative flow cytometry together with nutrient flux calculations, and is thereby altering perceptions of oligobacterial physiology. The novel technology will be extended to a wide cross section of students through graduate and undergraduate courses and seminars. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the work include the development of novel concepts, such as ways of linking aspects of the carbon and nutrient cycle to organism activity, physiology, nutrient concentrations, and temperature.

Our objective is to undertake a multi-pronged petrological and geochemical investigation to take advantage of existing data and models. <br/>The on-going eruption of Arenal volcano has undergone complex changes in eruptive behavior, and a crucial question is whether those changes relate to different magma storage conditions, such as varying depths and hence initial volatile contents, or to different degassing styles and rates. We will investigate this important issue through several techniques. We seek to determine the timescales of degassing, the residence times and ascent rate of degassed magmas, and the timescales of degassing-induced plagioclase crystallization. We will measure short-lived nuclides within the uranium decay series to constrain the timescales of magmatic processes as well as measure the long-lived isotopic compositions of whole rocks, and mineral separates and individual minerals in the case of Sr, to determine whether there is evidence for involvement of isotopically distinct components during differentiation processes. Lastly, we will measure a suite of major- and trace-element concentrations to evaluate the secular change in Arenal lava composition.<br/>The data from these tests will help answer questions such as whether rates of differentiation depend on the depth and degree of crystallization and on the extent and character of degassing; whether crystal and magma residence times can be as short as days to months during near steady-state eruptions of andesite; whether within-eruption changes of magma composition are caused by open-system processes of fractional crystallization plus recharge or assimilation or both; and whether eruption styles are related to degassing history and magma residence time.<br/>"

By making use of a marine research platform (the RV NB Palmer and on-board helicopters) and additional logistical support from the Argentine Antarctic program, the project will bring glaciologists, oceanographers, marine geologists and biologists together, working collaboratively to address fundamentally interdisciplinary questions regarding climate change.   The project will include gathering a new, high-resolution paleoclimate record from the Bruce Plateau of Graham Land, and using it to compare Holocene- and possibly glacial-epoch climate to the modern period; investigating the stability of the remaining Larsen Ice Shelf and rapid post-breakup glacier response ? in particular, the roles of surface melt and ice-ocean interactions in the speed-up and retreat; observing the contribution of, and response of, oceanographic systems to ice shelf disintegration and ice-glacier interactions.  Helicopter support on board will allow access to a wide range of glacial and geological areas of interest adjacent to the Larsen embayment. At these locations, long-term in situ glacial monitoring, isostatic uplift, and ice flow GPS sites will be established, and high-resolution ice core records will be obtained using previously tested lightweight drilling equipment. Long-term monitoring of deep water outflow will, for the first time, be integrated into changes in ice shelf extent and thickness, bottom water formation, and multi-level circulation by linking near-source observations to distal sites of concentrated outflow.  The broader impacts of this international, multidisciplinary effort are that it will significantly advance our understanding of linkages amongst the earth's systems in the Polar Regions, and are proposed with international participation (UK, Spain, Belgium, Germany and Argentina) and interdisciplinary engagement in the true spirit of the International Polar Year (IPY). It will also provide a means of engaging and educating the public in virtually all aspects of polar science and the effects of ongoing climate change. The research team has a long record of involving undergraduates in research, educating high-performing graduate students, and providing innovative and engaging outreach products to the K-12 education and public media forums. Moreover, forging the new links both in science and international Antarctic programs will provide a continuing legacy, beyond IPY, of improved understanding and cooperation in Antarctica.<br/><br/><br/>"

Fungi survive, reproduce, and carry out diverse biogeochemical transformations in arctic soils that are extremely cold, often dry, and mostly snow covered. Clearly, these fungi are adapted to extremes of cold and dark. Yet our knowledge of the identities and activities of these cold-adapted fungi is negligible. The goal of this work is to better understand fungal adaptation to cold, and will accomplish this by determining which species occur in the coldest climates, and which species are metabolically active at the coldest temperatures. While focused on adaptation, the project will also inform ecosystem ecology. Polar regions provide significant ecosystem services to society, including climate regulation. The ongoing changes in polar regions, which are often more rapid and of larger magnitude than in lower latitudes, are having uncertain effects on ecosystem services, particularly positive and negative feedbacks to global warming. Two key, interrelated uncertainties are 1) how vegetation patterns will change, and how these changes will feed back to climate, and 2) how soil carbon pools will change with changing patterns of permafrost, soil temperatures and vegetation cover. Mycorrhizal fungi strongly influence plant growth and community structure through their roles as ubiquitous symbionts of arctic plants. Decomposer fungi strongly influence rates and patterns of respiratory carbon release to the atmosphere, as well as mineralization and immobilization of the limiting nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus. Hence, soil-dwelling fungi are central players in both vegetation change and carbon dynamics, and therefore, uncertainties about the roles of fungi in polar ecosystem contribute to overall uncertainties about climate change and the future of polar regions. The three specific objectives in the research proposed are to: (1) reveal which fungal species are most adapted to extreme arctic environmental conditions by characterizing the changes in fungal communities along three latitudinal gradients (NAAT, Eurasia, Spitsbergen) using high-throughput, DNA-based clone-library sequencing; (2) test whether predicted changes in climate will select for more southerly or northerly fungal communities using reciprocal soil warming and cooling experiments and clone-library sequencing at the Toolik Lake and Bonanza Creek Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites; and (3) characterize the components of the fungal communities that are metabolically active in both summer and winter using a newly developed RNA-based library sequencing method. By revealing which species and guilds of fungi are most active in different habitats, in different seasons, and under different temperature regimes, the work will unveil novel insights into processes underling winter respiration and nutrient cycling in the Arctic. The study is pan-Arctic and international, both in geographic extent and in the collaborating consortium of US, Russian, and UK scientists. At the local level it will educate elementary school students about fungi and their ecology, and will support graduate education and scientific exchange among multiple countries. <br/>"

The obvious question is whether this acceleration is continuing. To address this question, funds are requested for a three-year program to continue elevation profiling of the glaciers of northwestern North America, which will be carried out with a small-aircraft laser altimeter system from 2007 through 2009. There will be a fourth year for analysis. The results will give us better regional coverage than we have at present, and permit more accurate and updated estimations of the contribution to rising mean sea level from this source region.  In all years, there will be an interpretative program that will focus on the effect of glacier wasting on sea level with special attention to trends, and on the connections between glaciers and climate. The objectives are to: 1) continue the glacier profiling and analysis program through the International Polar Year; 2) complete reduction, analysis and archiving of glacier profiling data from this and our related (and earlier) NASA projects;  3) develop an efficient and accurate method for extrapolating our flight-line elevation changes and volume change estimates from measured glaciers to all of the glacierized areas of northwestern North America, so estimates of the regional contribution from these glaciers to rising sea level can be updated at suitable intervals; and 4) interpret our results in terms of the role of glaciers in the climate system. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: The measurement of glacier wastage in northwestern North America is of interest to the public during this time of climate change and has received much press coverage. The public sees the wastage of glaciers as an impressive kind of barometer and illustration and a consequence of continuing climate change, the most practical consequence being the contribution of glacier wastage, globally to rising mean sea level. Thus, the question of whether glacier wastage is continuing to accelerate is of considerable interest. The effects of rising sea level on the coastal populations of the world are enormous and include direct flooding and related phenomena such as post-glacial uplift, increasing coastal erosion, and risk from storm surges. <br/><br/>"

This species offers a unique opportunity to follow the biochemistry and physiology of nutrient utilization in a large carnivore that may not be possible in any other system. This is due to the essentially impossible logistics of working with large predators such as free-ranging felids (e.g, lions, tigers) or ursids (bears) and obtaining multiple blood samples and measuring digestive chemistry while the animal is actively foraging. While such studies can be conducted in laboratory or zoo settings, they are necessarily limited to using captive animals where feeding times are typically constrained by husbandry requirements and to human-determined diets. However, a unique opportunity to perform digestive chemistry experiments in actively foraging large carnivores in the wild exists in the Antarctic. For several decades, the Weddell seal has been the focus of studies on natural diving physiology because of the ability to work with the species using isolated holes in the sea ice near McMurdo Station, Antarctica. In that system, the seal has access to a single ice hole where it routinely returns to breathe, sleep, digest, etc. With the use of blood-sampling catheters, serial samples of blood can be collected whenever the seal returns to the surface between diving bouts. Seals rely primarily on lipid metabolism for their daily energy demands and in this new program, nutrient metabolism in predatory carnivores will be studied by examining the kinetics of lipid uptake and utilization during active foraging bouts. Labeled blood samples from freely diving animals will be used to quantify lipid turnover rates and to characterize the various components of the lipid pool. Adult seal lipid uptake and utilization will be compared to similar processes in pups, which are biochemically adapted for massive and rapid lipid utilization while nursing. This project will provide rare and perhaps unparalleled data on the foraging biochemistry of freely living carnivores. Results will also provide insight not only to Antarctic ecosystem studies, but to the entire field of lipid metabolism in mammals and to the study of carnivore biology.<br/><br/><br/>"

The proposed project is intended to build upon these previous studies and, specifically, several dental investigations by J Irish -- in which 36 dental traits in samples throughout North and sub-Saharan Africa (n= 1,625 individuals) were compared. The objectives of the new project are to address the more specific, region-oriented questions in three ways. First, up to 5,000 dentitions in a cross-section of northeast Africans (and comparative West Asian and European samples), will be examined for the same traits, plus 32 dental measurements. This work will be done to discern collective traits across time/space beyond what little is known, and identify trends in occurrence. Second, those groups most dentally alike will be identified using inferential statistics. It is widely held that dental similarity approximates genetic relatedness. These numerically-derived affinities can then test existing hypotheses concerning population origins, relationships, migration, and microevolution. <br/>Previously, such hypotheses were derived and tested via artifactual evidence, or biological data subject to environmental and methodological bias. Dental anthropology is a proven field that minimizes these factors. Third, the findings will be contrasted with published genetic, linguistic, cultural, and other data to test for concordance among methods. These objectives, when met, will provide a better understanding of diachronic population history in a region that fostered some of the greatest civilizations the world has ever known.  <br/>"

The experiments will be conducted in the winter of 2001-02 at two, or possibly three, mountaintop observatories in the southwestern United States.  Central to the experiment is a novel instrument called the Cloud Condensation Nuclei Remover (CCNR).  It is a thermal gradient diffusion chamber through which an air sample is slowly drawn.  It flows as a thin, laminar ribbon between two saturated plates having different temperatures.  The supersaturation at the center of the chamber is regulated by adjusting the temperatures of the plates.  Depending on the supersaturation, some of the aerosols in the sample are activated, grow, and settle out as droplets on the bottom of the chamber as the air moves through.  The size distribution of the surviving particles is compared with that of the particles entering the chamber to determine the sizes of the particles that served as centers for cloud condensation.  By comparing electron microscope images and the chemical composition of the particles before and after exposure to the supersaturation it may be possible to learn more about the aerosol particles that are active in cloud formation.  The project is designed to resolve the discrepancies that currently exist between observations of the physical and chemical properties of aerosol particles and their cloud-forming ability. <br/><br/> <br/>"

In other words, the project focuses on soliton theory for initial profiles that are much broader than rapidly decaying or periodic. It is well-known that slow decay at infinity may lead to new phenomena. For instance, certain smooth but slowly decaying initial data may turn into rough or even blow-up revealing a very complicated relation between local and global behaviors. Standard techniques of PDEs or numerical analysis are ineffective to tackle such issues.  The IST is much better suited to study such phenomena as it combines both global and local properties of initial data, linearizes the problem, and provides accurate asymptotic behavior. Although the spectrum of the underlying differential operators (e.g. Schrödinger in the case of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation) is much more complicated than for the classical IST, it can be suitably expressed in terms of the Titchmarsh-Weyl m-function which is well-defined for virtually any reasonable initial profile.  The main thrust of this project is a study of the IST in this setting. In particular, the effect of different spectral components of the differential operator in the Lax pair on the solution of the corresponding nonlinear PDE will be investigated. <br/><br/>The inverse scattering transform was first discovered in the 60s for the KdV equation of shallow-water waves. Soon after, it was found for many other important nonlinear PDEs and now is regarded as a fundamental breakthrough in mathematics, connecting different branches of pure mathematics and theoretical physics, with numerous applications ranging from hydrodynamics and nonlinear optics to astrophysics and elementary particle theory. The importance of extending the range of validity of IST, which is the principal aim of the project, is recognized by both mathematicians and physicists. The results are expected to be of a very applied nature and could be employed for the study of wave propagation on different backgrounds (including noisy), tidal waves, certain meteorological phenomena, understanding freak waves or any other applied problems where initial data do not approach zero at infinity, and in such diverse disciplines as hydrodynamics, telecommunication, atmospheric sciences, nonlinear optics, plasma, astrophysics, etc. Given their remarkable pedigree, diversity of mathematics involved, and richness of applications, the topics of the project provide a great educational experience through research for the undergraduate and graduate students involved."

The ESAS stores the world?s largest hydrocarbon stocks, mostly as shallow Arctic hydrates, and thus represents a large potential methane atmospheric source that could result from global warming-triggered permafrost degradation. Increased methane fluxes could occur as numerous weak seeps or as strong bubble plumes over large areas. Due to the shallow depth of the ESAS, it is possible that the majority of methane released avoids oxidation and escapes to the atmosphere. The PIs will investigate the migration pathway characteristics and identify the controlling factors of methane flux from the seabed, in the water column, and to the atmosphere. The central hypothesis is that seabed methane fluxes are significant year-round sources while atmospheric fluxes are only significant during ice-free periods. The questions of methane sources, sinks, spatial and temporal variations in fluxes will be addressed through summer and winter expeditions to sample the water column and seabed, and helicopter surveys to sample the atmosphere. The PIs will also assess seafloor direct bubble flux over 6 control and 2 test sites on a nested range of sonar scales and using a combination of bubble video imaging and bubble modeling. Modeling will aim to develop a regional flux model. Broader impacts of the proposed activity include international collaboration, graduate and undergraduate student training, and public outreach."

All species of ice-dependent marine mammals of Beringia have been subject to petitions to designate them as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Accordingly, in 2008, the polar bear was listed as threatened after the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service [2008] found that ?polar bear habitat - principally sea ice - is declining throughout the species? range?. The case for the Pacific walrus is under review with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Endangered Species Program and two ice seal species have been proposed for protective status. A major challenge facing these national policy decisions is lack of information concerning the extent and distribution of critical habitat within the overall ice pack. Most climate models and standard sea ice data products provide ice extent and concentration information, but these quantities only partially explain the distribution of Arctic marine mammals. The size and shape of ice floes and openings has also been shown to be important, but there are currently no standardized means of monitoring these properties of the sea ice cover. <br/><br/>The work proposed here aims to develop new, powerful video processing techniques and bring them to bear on the problem of identifying and quantifying critical habitat areas within the Arctic ice pack. The project team brings together scientists and engineers with expertise in advanced image and video analysis and modeling, computational science, sea ice geophysics and marine mammal ecology. The research plan is centered on a computational-thinking approach to transforming high-volume video data into low-volume high-relevance information that is key to decision support in a range of settings. The overall aim is to develop and implement advanced video processing algorithms based on geophysical and ecological knowledge of sea ice to routinely map marine mammal habitat in ice covered waters. Data from the system will be disseminated to a cyber-enabled forum of experts, who will aid in habitat interpretation and provide guidance for data acquisition. The project will build on existing cyber-enabled forums such as the Sea Ice for Walrus Outlook (SIWO, co-organized by Eicken) as models for implementation. The techniques that will be developed will be readily extendible to other observing tasks such as marine hazard identification. Such information will become increasingly important in the near future with growing commercial activity and limited decision-making and support infrastructure in the Arctic. A readily-deployable, networkable system will allow increased marine traffic in the Arctic to be turned to an advantage.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the NSF Directorate for Geosciences and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR)."

The abrupt onset of Arctic spring  comes with the development of high pressure over Baffin Bay and the Labrador Sea and shifts in the jet stream and storm tracks. These changes are important for the Arctic climate and environment and have critical influences on Arctic peoples and ecosystems. This project will test the hypothesis that the spring Arctic transition is a dynamical phenomenon, driven by the downward influence of the springtime stratospheric final warming, abrupt changes in the flow over and around Greenland and in atmospheric waves over the North Atlantic, and shifts in the frequency and tracks of storms entering the Arctic. The spring transition effects the surface climate and is likely modified by feedbacks from surface processes. The implications of the dynamical onset of Arctic spring for future changes in the Arctic will be explored, through analyses of atmospheric and Arctic surface data,  experiments with a global atmospheric model, and analyses of 20th Century and future climate simulations. This project will develop a dynamical understanding of the Arctic spring transition and its interactions with the Arctic environment. It will use this understanding to evaluate climate models based on their ability to simulate the spring transition, and it will examine model projections of future changes in the Arctic environment resulting from changes in the timing, strength, and structure of the spring transition."

Increased export of water and the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus from river networks to the Arctic Ocean reflects shifts in patterns of water and nutrient movement in the arctic. Changing climate may contribute to such shifts by causing release of nutrients from thawing permafrost, altering precipitation patterns, increasing rates of biogeochemical reactions, or expanding storage capacity in thawed soils. These changes may have far-reaching effects because flowing water connects land to downstream aquatic ecosystems, but the flowpaths connecting terrestrial ecosystems to stream networks remain poorly understood. This research will focus on transport and reaction of water and solutes within water tracks, which are linear regions of surface and subsurface flow that connect hillslopes to streams and account for up to 35% of watershed area in arctic tundra. Specific objectives are to: 1) quantify sources of water and dissolved nutrients to water tracks, 2) identify effects of snow accumulation, thaw depth, and storm characteristics on storage and transport of water and solutes, and 3) estimate the effects of hydrology on rates of nutrient cycling in water tracks. <br/><br/>The research will have significance for predicting responses of the arctic to continued climate change through links between hydrologic and nutrient cycles. Further, research will increase understanding of the role of hillslopes in connecting terrestrial ecosystems to stream networks, contributing to filling a research gap in hydrology and biogeochemistry. In addition, this project will train young scientists (grade school through post-graduate) in the skills and methods used to study responses of water and nutrient cycles to climate change. Arctic tundra is inaccessible to most students, yet one of the environments most susceptible to climate-induced changes. This project will include opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to conduct research in the arctic, development of online instructional materials that bring cutting-edge topics and research methods to undergraduate courses in hydrology, and science lessons for K-6 students that incorporate real-time field data."

However, UMB cellular properties include extremely  small size and DNA content, high affinity for organic nutrients,  and resistance to growth in rich media.  Flow cytometry offers an  ideal window into these organisms not only because of the  flexibility and the variety of measurements that can be performed  by this instrumentation, but because typical cell numbers in  natural populations are ideally suited for this type of direct  analysis, natural cell populations can be preserved for analysis at  a later time, and the single-cell basis of the analysis can provide  a wealth of information on cell population structure.

The first phase of this project involves the sampling and full characterization of soils on the flux study sites which were jointly selected by all PIs involved in this collaborative proposal.  The soil characterization will provide database for extrapolating the results of gas flux studies over a geographic base.  The second phase involves the isolation and characterization of the inactive and active organic fractions in soils and soil solutions; then identification of the microbial active fractions using respiration experiments under controlled conditions and the active components as substrates for gas flux (both CO2 and CH4) using carbon labelling experiments.  It is hypothesized that the major sources of CO2 and CH4 production are the active fractions in SOM.  The composition, quantity of active and inactive organic carbon fraction and their turnover rate are expected to closely relate to gas flux on different arctic ecosystems.

The lay person often feels they ignore critical components of the ecosystem that affect the resource they are managing.  Modelers, on the other hand, often feel quite differently about this issue.  In a classic study (1985, Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 42:1066-1072), fisheries modelers Ludwig and Walters demonstrated that management could be more effective using a model of the fishery that was too simple than using the correct model form.  While considering uncertainty is important, the amount and quality of data limits model complexity.<br/><br/>The reason simple models that ignore certain biological processes can perform better for guiding management decisions is that our knowledge of biological systems is limited.  For typical natural resource data sets, the poor quality of the available data means that models that are highly parameterized give poor predictions.  For example, we may know a predator affects a deer population but not be sure how many deer it takes or whether it would switch to hunting another prey if deer became scarce.  If we tried to incorporate this predation into our management model for deer, we might estimate its effect so poorly that we'd generate worse predictions than if we'd left out the predator altogether.  The simpler, incorrect model might lead to better deer management.<br/><br/>Recent developments may have changed the advantage for simpler models in natural resource management.  Decision analytic approaches have recently experienced a rapid growth in fisheries, forestry, and conservation biology.  Rather than relying on a single, ""best"" model for management, modelers are now considering a wide range of possible models and looking for management strategies that are robust to most of the possibilities.  If multiple rather than single models are considered, it's no longer evident that complicated models will perform poorly for management purposes.  Considering more models increases the chance of including some that reflect the true state of nature.  It may be optimal, therefore, to admit as much uncertainty as possible so that all eventualities are considered.  In fact, natural resources modelers are now building models with hundreds of parameters.  However, including many models greatly increases the amount of computation that is required.  Many biologists and managers will be limited in their ability to analyze such complex models and may use simple models because of their tractability.<br/><br/>This study will investigate the optimal model complexity for decision analytic approaches to conserving and managing natural resources.  The approach is to simulate an exploited natural resource, the noisy data available to managers, and management based on decision analysis.  Management performance will be compared between simulations where the decision analysis is based on an overly simple model of the system and simulations where the analysis is based on the correct, more complex system model. <br/><br/>The study will determine whether admitting more uncertainty in model parameters is always better, whether simple models are preferable in some circumstances, and the consequences of using models that are simpler than optimal.  In particular, it will investigate how the optimal model complexity is affected by the amount and quality of the data available.<br/>"

Beringia today represents an area of considerable interest to arctic science, and this archipelago is host to several endemic species and populations.  The PIs plan to collect tissue and specimens of plants, mammals, birds, and invertebrates for further systematic and ecological study.  These surveys will be the first comprehensive study of the biota, and the PIs will compare their findings with historical collections and will provide baseline data for studies of the effects of global change in the Arctic.  Travel to St. Matthew is extremely difficult and expensive because of the isolation and logistical requirements.  The PIs plan to take advantage of unique opportunity afforded by USFWS, which is providing space for the PIs aboard their research vessel R/V Tiglax on a cruise to nearby Hall Island.

As a consequence,  they have adapted to a high fat marine-based diet, large  lipid stores (blubber), a clear reliance on lipid for energy  and minimal dependence on carbohydrate metabolism. Beyond  the basic requirements of glucose for central nervous system  demands, it appears that seals have a variety of metabolic  options for utilizing lipid for almost all other  requirements. One intriguing aspect of the lipid based  metabolism of seals is their ability to fast for extremely  long periods. Even the pups of some species, such as  elephant seals, can go without good or water for several  months. This metabolism is driven by lipid stores, but  regulation of the process is not understood. Questions exist  regarding the transfer of lipids between maternal blubber  stores, the milk and the pups. The distribution in time and  location of various types of lipid compounds in seals is not  known. This project will analyze a unique set of archived  samples of Weddell seal blood with the aim of elucidating  some of the questions relating to the lipid biochemistry of  fasting in seals. These samples, collected for other  purposes, became critical through analysis of the  biochemical parameters associated with weaning and long  duration fasting in seal pups. Collaboration between Drs.  Castellini and Rea and Dr. Rene Groscolas in France will  lead to a better understanding of lipid metabolism in these  Antarctic seals."

This system was selected                   because 1) it is a classic example of the more general                          mammal-vegetation-nutrient cycling problem, 2) the interaction                  between the African elephant and its habitat is, in its own                     right, of major concern to international conservation, 3) the                   Zimbabwe Department of Parks and Wildlife is strongly supporting                this project, and 4) The United States Agency for International                 Development (USAID) has funded the nutrient cycling portion of                  this study.  Specifically, patterns of browsing in the                          Colophospermum mopane woodlands, one of Africa's major vegetation               types and a critical habitat will be studied.  Repetitive                       browsing by elephant is the major form of natural disturbance                   influencing patch dynamics in mopane scrub and woodland, because                elephant repeatedly browse some patches of mopane in preference                 to others with the results that the vegetation of repetitively                  browsed patches is degraded.  This proposal will test 3                         alternative explanations of the rebrowsing of mopane by elephant                1) sodium enrichment of the soil in the vicinity of preferred                   patches, 2) nutrient (e.g. nitrogen) enrichment of the soil, or                 3) proximity of browsed patches to traditional paths of travel to               focal resources such as water or mineral licks."

The recent demonstration of                  trans-kingdom gene flow involving bacteria and yeast increased                  Plumley's awareness of this process - a process which has been well             documented in the agrobacterium/plant association.

A research goal              is to isolate the gene that codes for paralytic shellfish poisoning             toxins.  Long range goals of the research are to eradicate                      paralytic shellfish poisoning and to understand the mechanisms and              extent of trans-kingdom gene transfer in the marine environment.

The  model not only explains global patterns of organic matter  preservation, but also the general lack of preservation of  terrigenous organic matter and kerogen in the marine environment.   The test of the model will involve: (1) measurement of adsorption  and desorption of proteins, polyamino acids, and melanoidins by  clay minerals and iron oxide, (2) studies of the decomposition of  these adsorbed substances in coastal sediments, and (3)  measurements of the adsorption of natural sediment hydrolyzable  amino acids and organic matter.

In               response to the harsh conditions of  most natural environments,                 bacteria have adopted numerous strategies for survival.  One                    solution that appears to be quite common is that of                             miniaturisation, and in fact, most of the microorganisms seen in                marine and soil samples tend to be smaller than those capable of                growth in the laboratory.  At the very end of the size spectrum                 are marine bacteria that are known by various names, but which                  are frequently referred to as ""ultramicrobacteria"" due to their                 especially small size.  These bacteria may well represent the                   lower limit of cellular life, since the amount of genetic                       material (DNA) that they contain per cell is much less than that                typically seen in other bacterial cells.  This proposal is a                    first step in testing whether the ultramicrobacteria represent a                physiological group distinct from the larger marine                             microorganisms or are simply members of this group of larger                    bacteria that have adopted a miniature size for survival.  In                   order to determine the evolutionary relationships among these                   organisms, the total marine microbe population will first be                    separated into various size classes by filtration.  The DNA from                each size class will be isolated and compared to that from the                  other filters using short radioactively labeled fragments of RNA                to determine the diversity of species that comprise the                         ultramicrobacteria.  The experiments will utilize probes produced               from known marine bacteria and from species of any                              ultramicrobacteria that are capable of growing in pure culture.

We propose to investigate current hydrologic and thermal processes occurring  in the Siberian Arctic and compare their dynamics to watersheds we have studied in the Alaskan Arctic.  Our approach will be to synthesize hydrologic and meteorologic data collected by Japanese and Russian scientists in two nested watersheds near Tiksi, Russia and apply our spatially distributed coupled model to those watersheds.  Spatially distributed hydrologic models require spatially distributed calibration and verification data.   Collection of this data will be accomplished through utilization of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery.  Field ground truth will be collected by us to develop and verify SAR imagery neural network training data sets.  This research will identify the applicability of utilizing SAR imagery for use in developmental and operational hydrologic models in the Russian Arctic.

This research will also improve our understanding of the global hydrologic cycle by improving our understanding of the physical processes occurring in the Siberian Arctic, their variability and their interactions.  Finally, this research will enable a comparative analysis of hydrologic and thermal processes between latitudinally equivalent sites, and also a comparison of our ability to correctly simulate these processes.  This research will also enable an international meld of the GEXEX/GAME and ARCSS/LAII research programs and an international collaboration of Russian, Japanese and American investigators joining forces to share expertise and improve our understanding of processes of inter-continental dimension."

The lidar will determine altitude profiles of neutral sodium and iron, as well as calcium ions.  Watkins will investigate the relative roles of different neutral and ionized metallic structures, and the relevant physical and chemical processes associated with neutral and ion layers.  Spatial and temporal structure in ion layers may be determined from antenna scanning experiments with the radar; therefore, making feasible the study of the sodium and iron variability in terms of ion layer structure and temporal behavior.

The USDP is part of the International Continental Drilling   Program   (ICDP),   which   seeks   to   use   drilling   as   a   tool   to   advance understanding of fundamental processes of Earth's crust. The goal of the USDP is to understand the   eruptive behavior of Unzen as representative of an   important   class of andesitic arc volcanoes. In the now-completed first phase of the drilling project, flank holes of 750 m   and 1500 m were drilled to the base of  the volcanic edifice in order to obtain   a complete physical and chemical record of   the volcano's   activity.  This proposal aims to continue a one-year pilot project that has shown that the present Unzen magma system, which is characterized by   frequent injection of fractionated mafic magma into a crust-resident   slush   of remarkably constant   composition,   has   persisted for 500,000 years. The intellectual targets for the next phase of the drilling project will be: 1.)   to   understand   how   viscous   magma   behaves mechanically, chemically, and thermally   as   it   approaches Earth.s surface; 2.)   to   determine why   Unzen is   such   an exemplary case of   non-explosive   eruption   of   initially   wet   magma,   and   3.)   to   improve   techniques   to   forecast eruptions   by   providing   direct   subsurface   observations that   inform   interpretation   of   precursory   seismicity, deformation, and degassing. The investigators propose to   use   optical,   SEM,   electron microprobe, XRF,   and LA-ICPMS   techniques to   examine the   samples.   In   particular,   proximal   units   will   be   correlated to   units   encountered in   flank   drilling,   zones of hydrothermal alteration will be mapped, and intrusive features identified. Most importantly, the conduit   that   fed the 1991-1994   eruption   will   be   delineated. In   order to   constrain degassing behavior, special attention   will   be paid   to occurrence of intrusive glass on the margin   of   the   conduit   and residual melt   in   the   central portion.   Comparison   of glassy dome lava with   partially   crystalline conduit   material   (if   residual melt   remains) and with   crystalline conduit material will serve to define the complete crystallization   path   of Unzen magma.   Conduit   width,   textural variations within the conduit related to degassing and cooling, plausible rheologies of the magma and wallrock, and effects of conduit flow and degassing on the   wallrock will   be determined. In terms of broader impacts, the work should   improve the   understanding and predictability of this dangerous type of volcanic activity, which has afflicted not only Shimabara, Japan but   also towns near Pinatubo Volcano in the Philippines and Soufriere Hills Volcano in Montserrat in recent years. The project has attracted much public   interest   in   Japan,   and will likely   do   so   worldwide once drilling   to   the   conduit   has   begun.   Accordingly,   the   USDP   team   plans to make results available to   the   public   in   near-real   time   in   English,   Japanese, and   German over   the Worldwide   Web.

Because oxygen solubility in seawater is inversely proportional to temperature, the cold Antarctic seas are an exceptionally oxygen-rich aquatic habitat. Eight families of a single perciform suborder, the Notothenioidei, dominate the present fish fauna surrounding Antarctica. Notothenioids account for approximately 35% of fish species and 90% of fish biomass south of the Antarctic Polar Front. Radiation of closely related notothenioid species thus has occurred rapidly and under a very unusual set of conditions: relative oceanographic isolation from other faunas due to circumpolar currents and deep ocean trenches surrounding the continent, chronically, severely cold water temperatures, very high oxygen availability, very low levels of niche competition in a Southern Ocean depauperate of species subsequent to a dramatic crash in species diversity of fishes that occurred sometime between the mid-Tertiary and present. These features make Antarctic notothenioid fishes an uniquely attractive group for the study of physiological and biochemical adaptations to cold body temperature. <br/>Few distinctive features of Antarctic fishes are as unique as the pattern of expression of oxygen-binding proteins in one notothenioid family, the Channichthyidae (Antarctic icefishes). All channichthyid icefishes lack the circulating oxygen-binding protein, hemoglobin (Hb); the intracellular oxygen-binding protein, myoglobin (Mb) is not uniformly expressed in species of this family. Both proteins are normally considered essential for adequate delivery of oxygen to aerobically poised tissues of animals. To compensate for the absence of Hb, icefishes have developed large hearts, rapidly circulate a large blood volume and possess elaborate vasculature of larger lumenal diameter than is seen in red-blooded fishes. Loss of Mb expression in oxidative muscles correlates with dramatic elevation in density of mitochondria within the cell, although each individual organelle is less densely packed with respiratory proteins. <br/>Within the framework of oxygen movement, the adaptive significance of greater vascular density and mitochondrial populations is understandable but mechanisms underlying development of these characteristics remain unknown. The answer may lie in another major function of both Hb and Mb, degradation of the ubiquitous bioactive compound, nitric oxide (NO). The research will test the hypothesis that loss of hemoprotein expression in icefishes has resulted in an increase in levels of NO that mediate modification of vascular systems and expansion of mitochondrial populations in oxidative tissues. The objectives of the proposal are to quantify the vascular density of retinas in +Hb and -Hb notothenioid species, to characterize NOS isoforms and catalytic activity in retina and cardiac muscle of Antarctic notothenioid fishes, to evaluate level of expression of downstream factors implicated in angiogenesis (in retinal tissue) and mitochondrial biogenesis (in cardiac muscle), and to determine whether inhibition of NOS in vivo results in regression of angiogenic and mitochondrial biogenic responses in icefishes.  Broader impacts range from basic biology, through training of young scientists, to enhanced understanding of clinically relevant biomedical processes. <br/>"

Processes such as coalescence, Ostwald ripening, the effects of concentration gradients in the melt, and multiple nucleation events are all possible ways by which an initially uniform bubble size distribution derived from a single nucleation event may evolve into polymodal distributions more like that observed in pumice clasts. We propose here to experimentally quantify the rates and conditions under which these processes affect BSD's in rhyolitic and phonolitic melts at decompression rates, pressures, temperatures, and water contents applicable to magmatic ascent prior to the fragmentation limit. Our study will address the role that melt viscosity plays in the production of pumice vesicle size distributions by comparing results for natural high-silica rhyolite and phonolite compositions (h ~109 and 105 respectively). Our goal is to use these experiments to constrain pre-fragmentation effects at applicable conditions in order to better constrain how BSD modification may occur during eruptions to produce the VSD's present in quenched pumice. Our goal for this proposed work is an experimentally constrained model of the evolution of BSD's in ascending magma prior to fragmentation, and provide better constraints on the processes that contribute to vesicle size distributions observed in pumice.<br/><br/><br/>"

To accomplish this goal, the project will use ground-based high speed cameras to image their spatial and spectral development with unprecedented high temporal resolution.  Sprites are large (~50km vertical scale size) luminous events seen above thunderstorms often extending to ionospheric heights.  Most sprites are associated with positive cloud to ground lighting strikes, and the optical emissions last only from a few milliseconds to a few 10's of milliseconds.  Sprites start at 70 - 80 km altitude with downward propagating streamer heads.  In some events upward moving streamer heads are also observed, but upward moving streamers always start later than the downward streamers and further, they start from a lower altitude and from existing bright spots in the sprite body.  Previously funded research has shown sprite development to have essentially two phases:  an active initial phase characterized by fast moving streamer heads followed by a decay phase in which there is little spatial activity. <br/><br/>This analysis work will continue under this project and be augmented by observations taken with new high-speed imagers to record sprites with high temporal and spatial resolution.  Slit less spectroscopy will also be used to obtain sprite spectra with ~500m altitude, 0.1 ms (or possibly less) temporal and 10 nm spectral (400-800 nm) resolution.  For high spatial resolution a telescope will be used to obtain 3m spatial and possibly <100 s temporal resolution.  The program will include use of a roving ground station to allow for triangulation.  One field campaign per year will be undertaken.  The observations are expected to provide new images with unprecedented temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution, which will aid in providing realistic estimates of the amount of energy and charge deposited into the mesosphere by sprites.  The broader impacts of the project includes support of one full-time graduate student who will receive training in both observational and theoretical work suitable for a Ph.D. thesis.  Undergraduate cadets from the Air Force Academy will participate in gathering and analysis of the basic data.  The project may indirectly extend the use of high frame rate imagery to the ionosphere, thermosphere, and mesosphere community.  The observations will be made available to the sprite community, thus providing fundamental observational constraints on the various sprite and streamer theories available. <br/>"

Soliton theory originated in the striking discovery of an unexpected link between the Korteweg-de Vries equation in nonlinear hydrodynamics and quantum scattering theory.  It is regarded as a fundamental breakthrough in mathematics, connecting different branches of pure mathematics and theoretical physics, with numerous applications ranging from hydrodynamics and nonlinear optics to astrophysics and elementary particle theory. Titchmarsh-Weyl theory was developed in the connection with the Sturm-Liouville problem, which has become a cornerstone of the spectral analysis of ordinary differential operators.  This project is devoted to developing an approach to soliton theory that takes advantage of Titchmarsh-Weyl theory.

Because carbon and nutrients are cycled through the biosphere and plant species differ in traits that affect the rates of cycling of these elements, the abundance and diversity of species must affect ecosystem function.  However, the extent to which individual plant species affect ecosystem function and the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem response to perturbation are still largely unknown.  To what extent can plant species substitute for each other in ecosystem function?  What key traits determine whether a plant species' effect on nutrient cycling can be substituted by other species?  <br/>A field experiment in Alaskan tussock tundra will examine these questions by removing different combinations of plant species in the presence and absence of fertilization.  The investigators will obtain a detailed picture of how interactions between plant species control how nutrients are redistributed under fertilization, because nutrients are a primary control over carbon storage in this highly nutrient-limited ecosystem.  They will also track potential introductions of new species as plant community composition shifts because of the removals or fertilization.

These cores are the oldest terrestrial Arctic cores yet retrieved. This grant will support acquiring deeper cores in spring 2008 through to bedrock. The cores could potentially yield a record of Arctic climate dating back to over 3 My ago. Seismic measurements show 400 m of sediments overlying the impact breccias. This grant is the U.S. contribution to a multi-national effort to retrieve the cores and carry out subsequent scientific research, joining contributions from the ICDP, the Canadian, German and Russian governments.<br/>Intellectual merit: The goal is to collect and interpret the longest time-continuous record of climate change in the terrestrial Arctic and compare this record with those from lower latitude marine and terrestrial sites to better understand hemispheric and global climate change. Coring objectives include 2 replicate overlapping cores at 2 sites near the deepest part of the lake. One additional land-based core on lake sediments now overlain by frozen alluvial sediments will allow a better understanding of sediment supply to the lake. These cores will provide a unique Arctic record capturing the mechanisms and dynamics of glacial/interglacial and millennial-scale change for comparison with other long records from the oceans. This will allow scientists to evaluate and model systemic teleconnections and leads/lags relative to insolation forcing during periods of both 41 ka and 100 ka cycling. This record will provide insight as to whether rapid change events identified during the last glacial cycle are typical of earlier glacial periods. This core will allow us to address questions concerning the evolution and mode of Arctic climate change via the transition from the warm middle Pliocene to the onset of the first major Northern Hemisphere glaciation. The cores will provide a record of the regional sensitivity of the N E Asian Arctic to millennial-scale abrupt change and interglacial warmth detected in the timeframe of the EPICA ice cores, long Asian loess and lake records, and marine records.<br/>Broader impacts: This work will help us understand the background of natural variations in Arctic climate so that modern changes can be understood within that context. As this work will occur during the International Polar Year (IPY), the retrieval of a unique Arctic core will be especially timely.

The main working hypotheses are that both light and nutrient supply control biomass formation within the sea ice.  While irradiance controls the rate of biomass change in spring and autumn, nutrient advection dominates during summer as meltwater accumulation below the ice impedes nutrient supply and hence limits the total biomass accumulation in the ice cover.  To verify these hypotheses the project combines field studies, laboratory experimental work and remote sensing observations.  This approach is designed to quantify the ice-related biogeochemical processes and to supply a regional, seasonally varying estimate of carbon accumulation in, and release from, the ice cover.  The shipboard work will take place during two spring-summer (May-August) expeditions when physical, chemical and biological parameters will be measured at locations encompassing the prevalent ice types.  Ice thickness and structure will be determined using an indirect measurement technique along transects varying in length from hundreds to thousands of meters.  Ice cores will be analyzed to determine the vertical distributions of salinity, temperature, stable isotope concentrations, algal pigment concentrations and species composition.  Primary production will be determined using optical and tracer techniques.  Laboratory experimental work will assess the relationships among ice physics, chemistry and algal activity and to extrapolate results of the field measurements to early spring and late summer when shipboard sampling is more difficult.  Integration of remote sensing data will contribute to regional estimates of ice algal production and its temporal and spatial variability within the study region.  This proposal contributes to the goals of the western Arctic Shelf-Basin Interaction program by assessing the regional contribution of ice-associated primary production and consequent accumulation and release of carbon from the ice to the adjacent water column system.  Results are expected to help in understanding and quantifying the ice algal community response to climate variations."

USDP is a developing project of the International Continental Drilling Program (ICDP), which seeks to use drilling as a tool to advance understanding of fundamental processes of continental crust. The United States is a major partner and funding source for ICDP, through the National Science Foundation. The goal of USDP is to understand the eruptive behavior of Unzen as representative of an important class of andesitic arc volcanoes. This is to be done through a program of drilling, borehole observation, and core analysis in complement with ongoing surface geological and geophysical studies as well as the remarkable suite of geophysical and geochemical observations made during the recent eruption. That devastating episode occurred during 1991 to 1994, claimed 44 lives, and did some $2 billion in damage.<br/>In the first phase of the project, for which support is requested through this proposal, flank holes of 750 m and 1500 m are being drilled to the base of the edifice in order to obtain a complete physical and chemical record of the volcano's activity. Simultaneously, and also to be supported under this request, planning will be undertaken for the second phase in which multiple core sections through the conduit will be obtained in order to address problems of magma transport and degassing. These observations will aid in understanding the paradox of effusive eruption of water-rich magma. The overall scientific rationale and plan for this undertaking are presented in the proposals to ICDP and will be repeated in condensed form here to provide context. ICDP itself supports drilling only, not the associated science, hence the need for this request.<br/>Recent eruptions of Unzen, Pinatubo, and Soufriere Hills volcanoes have graphically demonstrated the concept that injection of mafic magma into a crustal slush is an important petrologic process and a volcanic trigger. The high visibility of these events has served to strengthen a dialog between workers on volcanic and plutonic rocks, and reinvigorated the investigation of mafic enclaves and disequilibrium phenocryst assemblages. A basic question has become: how do we fit these products of open system behavior of magma systems, produced by mafic recharge or replenishment, into the broader picture of crustal plutonism and volcanism? A subset of that question, which this proposal seeks to answer, is: What are the long term-petrologic consequences of repeated mafic inputs to the crustal magma system? Studies to date have elucidated single events as sampled by eruption products or viewed the end product of many such events in the form of mafic and silicic layered intrusions (MASLI).

These assessments have evolved towards complex models involving hundreds of parameters. Their implementation is time-consuming and limited to highly trained technical staff. Additionally, this complexity makes these models completely opaque to decision makers and stakeholders. A recent study of a simplistic simulated salmon fishery showed that assessments based on simpler models could outperform those using more complex models, even if the more complex models were correct and even if their use allowed the incorporation of additional relevant information. This research extends this analysis by simulating the Eastern Bering Sea pollock stock and its fishery. The results of this analysis will demonstrate whether simpler models can provide reliable estimates. <br/><br/>The pollock fishery is the largest U.S. fishery, with harvests averaging over a million tons per year, and the stock is also a major component of the Bering Sea ecosystem. The findings of this research will improve the economic and conservation performance of management of this fishery. The results are likely to inform stock assessment procedures in a wide range of fisheries in the U.S. and elsewhere."

Sea ice forecasting on seasonal-to-interannual timescales, especially over the summer and into fall, is of particular interest. Though each stakeholder is driven by different priorities, all require improved monitoring, prediction, and communication of sea ice conditions. To date, sea ice modeling efforts have largely focused on climate scales (i.e., response to greenhouse gas forcing) or targeted synoptic forecasting in support of navigation. Sea ice forecasting on seasonal scales is a challenge because of: (1) high variability in atmospheric and oceanic influence, (2) observations for initialization and validation have limited coverage and/or high uncertainties, (3) limitations of current model capabilities, (4) inherent limitations in sea ice predictability, and (5) an Arctic system changing in ways without recent historical precedent.<br/><br/>The SEARCH Sea Ice Outlook was implemented four years ago in an ad hoc fashion, requesting voluntary contributions to estimate September sea ice extent based on late spring (June 1) conditions. Contributions have been made using different methods that vary from complex (partially- and fully- coupled general circulation models and statistical relationships) to basic (trend extrapolation, heuristic, public poll). The Outlook will be organized and expanded into a more structured, coordinated and formal effort that focuses on tackling key barriers to sea ice forecasting, including rigorous evaluation of predictions, coordination and organization of relevant observations for initialization, evaluation of methods, and finally, an organizational network structure to manage the efforts and communicate results in new ways. This effort builds on the experience of the past four years and expands on structures already in place, leveraging resources and expertise at an international scale to help address a set of challenges recognized as priorities by a range of U.S. and international programs and organizations.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit - This project advances NSF?s goal of providing improved predictive tools for the Arctic by creating an innovative network of scientists and stakeholders to generate, assess and communicate arctic seasonal sea ice forecasts. The network?s focus is to develop new methods to evaluate forecasts, new metrics for synthesis and comparison across forecast methods and new approaches to initialize forecast methods with targeted observations. Finally, the network will investigate how different forecasting methods can be combined to exceed predictive skills of narrower approaches. The research team will explore how best to plan observations for improved seasonal predictions and how these predictions in turn can advance understanding of the evolving state of the arctic sea ice cover.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts - Improved seasonal forecasts of arctic sea ice will be developed and disseminated for societal benefit. By fostering and coordinating an international network of researchers and leveraging a broad range of activities, the project provides information tailored to stakeholders? needs. In addition to rigorous evaluations of stakeholder information needs, the network will develop a common reference framework for key sea ice variables and predictors, generating integrated datasets and predicted fields for the scientific community and stakeholders. Activities will also be initiated to inform and engage the growing internet communities of citizen scientists, many of whom already show a strong interest in arctic science, have capabilities for their own original and potentially worthwhile analysis, and connect with wider networks of media and public discussion. The activities will include graduate students and post-docs who are mentored to conduct high-quality research at the intersection of fundamental and applied research. By entraining more young researchers into the network, the project also addresses an important need for qualified experts that can help address urgent questions concerning resource uses and ecosystem services impacted by rapid arctic sea ice change."

GLOBE is an international hands-on environmental/earth science research and education program for a global community of elementary and secondary schools participating in 112 countries. GLOBE's vision promotes and supports students, teachers and scientists to collaborate on inquiry-based investigations of the environment and the Earth system.  Now in its 19th year, GLOBE has provided professional development and training in the content and skills of environmental science for over 65,000 teachers from 24,000 schools and engaged more than 10 million students in: learning about the scientific process; discovering the science of their environment; and, contributing more than 90 million protocol-based observations in support of scientific research. A significant number of students who have been introduced to science through GLOBE have continued on to obtain degrees in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and pursue careers in STEM. As noted in several recent reports, the health and vitality of the STEM workforce is critical to the Nation's prosperity. It is also observed that STEM research is increasingly conducted as a global enterprise built on multiple international collaborations. As such, programs like GLOBE, which engage students in STEM pathways within a culturally diverse and rich context, are extremely important.  A growing community of former GLOBE participants is seeking to find meaningful and cost-effective ways to give back to the GLOBE program and contribute to its efforts to support a vibrant and diverse community of students engaged in scientific endeavors worldwide.  Defining strategies for leveraging the ongoing enthusiasm and support of a global network of GLOBE alumni is an important and cost-effective opportunity for sustaining and expanding the impact of the program.<br/><br/>This proposal seeks funds to convene a strategic planning workshop to develop a coherent framework for activating and employing a new alumni network comprised of previous participants in the GLOBE science and education program.  This workshop will be held in parallel with the annual GLOBE partner meeting and quadrennial Global Learning Expedition (GLE) in New Delhi, India (August 3-8, 2014), in order to leverage the availability of a larger community of GLOBE scientists, educators, trainers, students, partners, and sponsors attending the GLE. The workshop agenda is focused on sharing of current activities being undertaken by specific alumni communities, collecting input from the GLE participants regarding priority areas where alumni involvement can be most useful, developing a strategic plan that considers operational factors, laying a foundation for creation of a GLOBE alumni near-peer mentoring network, and recruitment of international participants in research on the effectiveness of the GLOBE alumni near-peer mentoring activities. The team of GLOBE participants convening this workshop has been involved as leaders or trainers within the program for several years and they have the necessary skills and connections to make this workshop succeed in achieving its goals. NASA and NSF have supported a recent modernization of the GLOBE technical infrastructure used for communication, data sharing, and analysis; these upgrades have dramatically improved the ability of GLOBE participants to use social media and more sophisticated collaboration software. These upgrades have been accompanied by a shift in the governance model for GLOBE operations, from being centrally managed in the United States to a more community-driven management process.  These reforms make the proposed effort to meaningfully engage the GLOBE alumni especially timely.  The GLOBE program is well-positioned for new growth; having additional support from alumni as both near-peer mentors and role models will both help GLOBE realize this potential and provide new mechanisms for supporting the STEM ambitions of its students."

The principal methods of this work come from the soliton theory. Solitons are very special solitary waves (""bumps"") of water that move with constant speed without any deterioration in their shape. The first soliton siting was described in 1834 by the Scottish naval architect John Scott Russell, who noticed this wave in a channel and pursued it on his horse for quite a while. The soliton theory was originated in the mid-1960s from the fundamental Gardner-Greene-Kruskal-Miura discovery of the inverse scattering transform (IST) for the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation for shallow water waves (this equation happens to describe the channel phenomenon that Russell observed). Soon thereafter different versions of IST were found for many other physically important nonlinear evolution partial differential equations (PDEs) referred to as completely integrable systems. Being conceptually similar to the Fourier transform, the IST has yielded a tremendous amount of information about completely integrable systems, far beyond what standard PDE techniques may offer. Soliton theory is regarded as a major achievement of the 20th century science connecting different branches of pure mathematics and theoretical physics with numerous applications ranging from hydrodynamics and nonlinear optics to astrophysics and elementary particle theory. Much of work in soliton theory has been done on the propagation of waves initiated by rapidly decaying or periodic initial data (the so-called classical data). The corresponding solutions have a relatively simple and well understood wave structure of running solitons accompanied by radiation of decaying waves, or periodic wave-trains and their modulations. However any deviation from classical data meets principal difficulties that are yet to be surmounted. The project will focus on soliton theory for initial profiles that are much broader than classical. We expect new types of solutions with much more complicated wave structure and far-reaching practical applications. It is expected that the results could be used for understanding rogue waves, soliton propagation on different backgrounds (including noisy), tidal waves, certain meteorological phenomena (e.g. morning glory), or for the study of propagation of coherent structures in noisy media in such diverse disciplines as hydrodynamics, telecommunication, atmospheric sciences, nonlinear optics, plasma, astrophysics, etc.<br/>  <br/>In the context of the KdV equation the principal investigator has reformulated the classical IST in terms of Hankel operators and Titchmarsh-Weyl m-functions that let one extend the IST to a surprisingly broad class of initial data. This was achieved by employing some subtle properties of the m-function and deep results from the theory of Hankel operators. The principal investigator  plans to use powerful methods of Hankel operators to identify the broadest possible class of initial profiles for which a suitable analog of the IST exists. Another objective is asymptotic analysis of the underlying solutions. The well-known powerful machinery of the classical Riemann-Hilbert problem breaks down on such initial profiles in a number of serious ways. The main thrust will be put on understanding how to make the Riemann-Hilbert problem work far outside of the realm of classical problems. The results are expected to be instrumental for various applications.  The accompanying mathematical problems are also very important to the theory of the Schrodinger operator, the cornerstone of quantum mechanics, and the theory of Hankel and Toeplitz operators, fundamental objects of operator theory. Uncovering connections between soliton theory and Hankel operators theory is of great independent interest and could potentially have a profound influence on both theories.  The project will have a very large educational component. The principal investigator is committed to continuing his research experience for undergraduates program on nonlinear wave phenomena to identify and mentor young scholars in the field of applied mathematics. It is his intent to attract a diverse (gender, ethnicity, disability) group of talented undergraduates into the program to broaden the participation of underrepresented in the mathematical sciences groups."

What props up the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and New Mexico ? is the surface elevation high because of extra-thick, buoyant crust underneath, or is the crust no thicker than in the surrounding areas and it is instead hotter than usual mantle sitting underneath that supports the unusually high elevations? To answer this question, we must map the crust-mantle boundary under the Rockies. Conventional methods to do this have so far left a fair amount of ambiguity regarding crustal thickness. We propose to solve this by investigating question 2: Can we use a recently developed method that has been successfully applied to shallow geophysical problems, such as hydrological imaging, to find the much deeper crust-mantle boundary?<br/><br/>We will use already collected seismic data sets and apply new analysis techniques to provide constraints on the dynamics of a tectonically enigmatic area.  The Southern Rocky Mountain region has recorded a complex history of continental assembly, mountain building far from plate boundaries, and incipient continental rifting. Because the mechanism and timing of uplift of this large area are still under debate, the region has been the subject of intensive study with active and passive source seismic profiles and networks.  A recurrent theme from these studies is that the high surface elevations are not mirrored by a thick crustal root, however the most recent crustal thickness estimates still differ by ~10 km.  This difference has significant implications for mechanisms to explain the support of high topography in the region, specifically whether the surface elevation is isostatically balanced within the crust or support for the high elevations has to come from deeper in the Earth.  Our project is an interdisciplinary collaboration to apply techniques developed by the team for shallow high-frequency seismic applications to lithospheric scale seismology. Specifically, we plan to use diffracted seismic waves, from earthquakes and from ambient seismic noise, to image the Moho (the seismic velocity contrast that can be identified with the crust-mantle boundary). Detection of Moho diffractions is to date limited to earthquakes and explosion sources. Our approach is to perform interstation crosscorrelations of previously recorded explosions and earthquakes and of ocean-generated ambient seismic noise to simulate a signal source at each station location. This technique would allow detection of Moho diffractions and therefore Moho mapping in areas where conventional techniques are not applicable."

The Scar Inlet Ice Shelf (SIIS) is the southern remnant of the former Larsen B Ice Shelf, which disintegrated in March of 2002. Since then, the SIIS has weakened significantly but has not yet broken up. Cooler conditions than those seen prior to 2006 have reduced the chance of a disintegration in recent years, although a single warm season is likely to be enough to trigger such an event. The predicted ""Super El Nino"" for this austral summer may have significant effects on Antarctica's weather, potentially leading to a break-up or disintegration this year.  Given the very weak state of the SIIS, it is urgent that we act now to better understand the processes involved in shelf disintegration or break-up of ice shelves. The goal of this work is to collect several key data sets, publish initial observations and preliminary conclusions, and then make the complete data record available to all scientists.<br/><br/>Extreme changes in the stress conditions on the SIIS resulted from both the loss of the Larsen B ice plate and the continued inflow of ice from three large glaciers (Flask, Leppard, and Starbuck). The SIIS now has a number of large rifts and it is expected to break up or disintegrate in the very near future. Past research has made use of satellite data and weather instruments, establishing many of the current ideas regarding ice shelf break-ups and ice shelf weakening. Additional ground-based data to be collected under this study will test a number of hypotheses regarding pre-disintegration characteristics, triggering mechanisms, fracturing processes, runaway feedback effects, and stabilizing mechanisms. The project will collect extensive multi-instrument field observations of the SIIS and possibly capture a major disintegration event. In collaboration with the British Antarctic Survey, a team of 4 people will be deployed via Twin Otter for up to 4 weeks to a site with a broad view of the shelf and will install several temporary observing instruments there. The study derives its intellectual merit from the role of the Antarctic Peninsula as a microcosm of how other parts of Antarctica might evolve and de-glaciate in the next few centuries. The broader impacts include an opportunity to educate the public about the anticipated collapse of this remnant ice shelf and its relationship to future changes in Antarctica. The potential for wide media coverage (through a connection with the National Geographic) will underscore the critical changes scientists are observing in the crysophere driven by climate change.  This proposal requires field work in Antarctica."

The ice measurement program will include thickness,  salinity, temperature, density, brine content, and included gas  volume, as well as such structural properties as the fraction of  frazil, platelet, and congelation ice in the seasonal antarctic  pack ice.  Differences in ice types are the result of differences  in the environment in which the ice forms: frazil ice is formed in  supercooled sea water, normally through wind or wave-induced  turbulence, while platelet and congelation ice is formed under  quiescent conditions.  The fraction of frazil ice is an important  variable in the energy budget of the upper ocean, and contributes  significantly to the stabilization of the surface layers.    The numerical models will involve the thermodynamics of phase  changes from liquid water to ice, along with the resulting energy  transfer, brine expulsion, and the modulating effect of a snow  cover.

Large in volume, these  environments contain sufficient bacteria to form a major  component of biomass on earth. Oligobacteria, the dominant  pelagic organisms present, are almost totally unculturable,  perhaps because their growth strategies favor nutrient  collection over induction and regulation against excessive  transport of extracellular solutes. Pure cultures of the  more numerous and probably more typical oligobacteria  virtually always fail to propagate. Thus the environment of  oligobacteria is extreme because conditions have been  impossible to formulate sufficiently well for dependable  growth, a condition stemming from the extremely small  concentrations involved. General strategies for growth in  terms of biochemistry, molecular biology and kinetics are  therefore not well understood.  The aim of this effort is to  bring bacteria more representative of the oligotrophic  environment into cultivation and report their properties. To  do this, extinction cultures will be prepared from seawater  and culturabilities established. From the number of species  detected, estimates of the number of culturable species in  the parent water can be determined. Cultures are  continuously mixed and dialyzed against native seawater for  nutrient supply and waste-product removal. Pure cultures  will be selected from these on the basis of flow cytometry  patterns and investigated for basic nutritional properties  in order to produce useful quantities of biomass. The  resulting cultures will be used for more detailed  investigations to include i) size, DNA content, and cell  density, ii) phylogenetic location, iii) cytoplasmic and  particularly membrane protein distributions with attention  to permeases, and iv) detailed nutri tional properties  including the kinetic constants that specify nutrient  uptake. These data will be used to advance concepts of  oligotroph functionality."

Hawaiian Volcano Observatory in January 1996 and February 1997 to make the most detailed seismic recordings on Kilauea Volcano ever, using the largest total number of seismic instruments ever installed on a volcano. One hundred-sixteen portable seismographs were installed beginning January 11, 1996 in and near Kilauea Crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park as a joint Japan-United States research project to record volcanic earthquakes and tremor. On February 1, 1996, a swarm of over 500 earthquakes was recorded by the dense network, providing the best recording of an earthquake swarm at Kilauea. In February 1997, a second intrusion of molten rock was recorded by the networks in place for Phase II of the experiment. The data collected offer an unprecedented opportunity to understand earthquakes associated with magma transport. Similar events occur at many volcanoes and they will be useful to forecast eruptions.

The                   longer temporal scale of the ground-based measurements will                     complement the short term, greater areal coverage of the aircraft               measurements.                                                                        The PI proposes to conduct measurements of NO and NOy at one               of the PEM-WEST intensive ground based stations for a period of                 six weeks.  These measurements are proposed to contribute to the                overall mission objectives to evaluate ozone photochemical                      production and loss rates as a function of altitude and                         geographic position, to examine transport fluxes and identify                   Asian source regions of advected ozone and ozone precursors, and                to conduct model studies of OH mixing ratios over the western                   Pacific from observations of O3, CH4, CO, NOx, and NMHC."

The role of solid surfaces as attachment sites for bacteria figures strongly in the formulation and testing of hypotheses. The three main objectives are: 1) to characterize the evolution and spatial distribution of the different phase components in sea-ice pores on scales relevant to microorganisms; 2) to determine the in-situ distribution of bacteria within the ice matrix and their association with different surfaces; and 3) to examine bacterial activity in brine solutions at temperatures from 4 to -300C as a function of concentration of dissolved organic matter and presence of different surfaces. The research approach combines field observations of Arctic sea ice (known to entrain mineral surfaces) with novel laboratory experiments designed to characterize micro-physical features of sea-ice as it evolves at decreasing temperature and to measure microbial reactions to increasingly extreme thermal and chemical conditions. The plan relies upon standard methods for assessing bacterial abundance and location (epifluorescence and scanning electron microscopy) and selected metabolic activities (substrate uptake and extracellular hydrolysis), but applied in new ways (after ice sublimation, to viscous sub-zero brines). Standard methods for physical and chemical assessments of sea ice will also be employed, but in combination with novel techniques (micro-scale collections by sublimation, NMR). Results will significantly expand the knowledge base for predicting the lower temperature threshold for microbial life on Earth and possibly elsewhere on ice-covered solar bodies. They should also enhance understanding of the seasonal functioning of polar microbial ecosystems and sea-ice itself, as it effects the global heat budget and climate, and practical applications of low-temperature bacteria and enzymes in biotechnology. <br/>"

The effort proposed here will take advantage of the                    improvements to study two interesting and important problems in                 ionospheric physics.  The first is the appearance of thin layers of             metallic ions at altitudes near 110 km.  These layers have been                 observed at lower latitudes and have been explained as the                      concentration of meteoric material due to shears in the neutral                 winds.  At high latitudes this explanation does not apply, so that              the appearance of these layers in the Sondrestrom data is an                    important breakthrough.  The second topic of the proposed study is              the enhanced ionization at altitudes below 100 km that occurs at                high latitudes during large magnetic storms.  This ionization is                produced by energetic protons from the sun and its presence at such             low altitudes can produce dramatic changes in radiowave propagation             at high latitudes."

Previous               linear analyses have been incapable of exploring the non-linear                 dynamics; previous non-linear analyses have treated the                         magnetosphere as an autonomous system, which clearly neglects the               major effects of the solar wind.

He will also use a new experimental mode that simultaneously determines latitudinal variation of electric fields and high resolution density structures.  In conjunction with a new numerical model, these data will investigate the relative roles of electric fields and neutral winds in layer formation, determine the effects of time-varying E-fields, and discover the effects of aeronomic parameters, such as the ion-neutral collision frequency.

Dr.                 Duffy has chosen a receptor protein recently reported to be the                 precursor to the amyloid deposits found in aging mammalian                      brains.  Preliminary studies by others indicate that the gene is                highly conserved across species and appears to be expressed in                  many different cell types, including neurons.  In this initial                  phase, Dr. Duffy will survey a variety of cell types, including                 endothelial cells, glial, neurons and fibroblasts to see if the                 protein is expressed in sufficient quantities for biochemical                   studies.

Dialkyl                         glycine decarboxylase (DGD) from Pseudomonas cepacia is                         probably such an enzyme.  It can catalyze both                                  decarboxylation and transamination reactions.  Previous work                    with this enzyme suggests that the proton transfer is                           unusual. DGD catalyzes proton transfer to the 4' carbon of                      the cofactor instead of the alpha carbon of the amino                           acid.  A reasonable hypothesis is that DGD is structurally                      similar to other decarboxylases but differs from them by                        inverting the basicities of histidine and lysine.  This                         change would place the solvent proton preferentially on                         lysine which is closer to the cofactor 4' carbon.

ARGOS positioning is currently used on most buoys and is unable to resolve ice drift response to inertial wave, tidal forcing and short-term weather events.  Velocity and strain-rate errors consequent to the use of ARGOS positioning result in misrepresentation of ice deformation?s impact on the ice thickness distribution.  They argue that there is a very simple fix to this problem - deploying GPS equipped buoys.  The PIs present a way forward to convert the International Arctic Buoy Program (IABP) buoy network to GPS positioning, and are provided modest start-up funds to implement a demonstration of this.  They anticipate that the improved IABP network will provide pan-Arctic monitoring of regional ice deformation variability on sub-daily to seasonal time scales.  Sea ice deformation products will be developed for public dissemination, enabling regional estimates of ice thickness distribution to be improved and open water fraction monitored, essentially assisting in the monitoring of ocean-atmosphere fluxes in the Arctic.  They propose buoy deployments to complement Automated Drifting Stations (ADSs).  At these stations localized measurements of multi-year ice mass balance, ocean fluxes, ocean profiles and meteorology are made.  Understanding surface fluxes and ice mass balance in the ADS vicinity requires an understanding of the evolution of the local ice thickness distribution.  Arguing that it currently is unknown what area of local ice pack affects the energy budget measured at the ADS, they plan to deploy local GPS deformation arrays around ADSs with a view to determining the spatial scale necessary to monitor in order to provide a full picture of how both ice dynamics and thermodynamics impact the energy budget at the ocean-ice- atmosphere interface in the vicinity of the ADS."

Understanding the environmental factors that control predator population dynamics is critically important for projecting the state of populations under future climate change scenarios, and for designing better conservation strategies for the Antarctic ecosystem. For the first time, datasets from a network of observational sites for the Adélie penguin across the entire Antarctic will be combined and analyzed, with a focus on linkages among the ice environment, primary production, and the population responses of Adélie penguins. The project will also further the NSF goals of making scientific discoveries available to the general public and of training new generations of scientists. The results of this project can be used to illustrate intuitively to the general public the complex interactions between ice, ocean, pelagic food web and top predators. This project also offers an excellent platform to demonstrate the process of climate-change science - how scientists simulate climate change scenarios and interpret model results. This project supports the training of undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of polar oceanography, plankton and seabird ecology, coupled physical-biological modeling and mathematical ecology. The results will be broadly disseminated to the general oceanographic research community through scientific workshops, conferences and peer-reviewed journal articles, and to undergraduate and graduate education communities, K-12 schools and organizations, and the interested public through web-based servers using existing infrastructure at the investigators' institutions. <br/><br/>The key question to be addressed in this project is how climate impacts the timing of periodic biological events (phenology) and how interannual variation in this periodic forcing influences the abundance of penguins in the Antarctic. The focus will be on the timing of ice algae and phytoplankton blooms because the high seasonality of sea ice and associated pulsed primary productivity are major drivers of the Antarctic food web. This study will also examine the responses of Adélie penguins to changes in sea ice dynamics and ice algae-phytoplankton phenology. Adélie penguins, like many other Antarctic seabirds, are long-lived, upper trophic-level predators that integrate the effects of sea ice on the food web at regional scales, and thus serve as a reliable biological indicator of environmental changes. The proposed approach is designed to accommodate the limits of measuring and modeling the intermediate trophic levels between phytoplankton and penguins (e.g., zooplankton and fish) at the pan-Antarctic scale, which are important but latent variables in the Southern Ocean food web.  Through the use of remotely sensed and in situ data, along with state of the art statistical approaches (e.g. wavelet analysis) and numerical modeling, this highly interdisciplinary study will advance our understanding of polar ecosystems and improve the projection of future climate change scenarios."

The award will allow to study how centralized economic planning affected the relationships between Tozhu reindeer herders and hunters of Siberia and how, when these restrictions were removed, the Tozhu successfully re-adapted to their ancestral way of life. <br/><br/>The researcher accurately argues that understanding these relationships are key to a wider understanding of indigenous economies' resilience to change and the long-term sustainability of indigenous livelihoods globally.<br/><br/>The Tozhu traditionally relied on reindeer, dogs, and horses for food, transportation, and hunting. However, during the Soviet era large-scale reindeer herding was promoted by the government, which also instituted a policy of killing dogs, which ultimately caused the disappearance of indigenous breeds. In the post-Soviet system, dogs have once again become an integral part of hunting and herding among the Tozhu and this research aims to understand the complex role human-animal relationships play in the foundation of the Tozhu reindeer herding communities in the 21st century. Very little research has been done on this topic and none in this region of Siberia."

These natural hazards directly threaten surrounding communities and global air traffic.  Our ability to mitigate these risks is restricted by our inability to safely measure volcanic jets or monitor them co-eruptively.  Infrasound (acoustic signals with frequencies below that of human hearing) provides a means to detect the atmospheric oscillations from volcanoes at distances of meters to thousands of kilometers from the source. This project aims to use these signals to constrain the physics of volcanic jets and measure<br/>them in real-time.  These measurements may be used as input parameters for aviation safety ash-cloud prediction models and toward assessing the hazard presented to local communities by a given eruption. Additionally, this work will provide constraints on eruptive parameters and physics for numerical and experimental studies.<br/><br/>Recent infrasound recordings of volcanic jets have frequency spectra similar to the acoustic signal produced by man-made jets (jet noise). For the past 60 years, aeroacoustics has studied the relationship between the flow properties of man-made jets and the acoustic signal produced.  Our long-term objective is to reverse this concept by determining the flow properties of volcanic jets based on the infrasound signal produced by the eruption.  This work represents a first step toward this long-term goal.  We begin by building a catalog of infrasonic jet noise observations to determine characteristic volcanic jet noise features and determine any correlations between these features and known eruptive parameters.  This process includes searching existing infrasound databases using new signal processing tools and empirical and theoretical propagation modeling.  We will then use analytical and numerical models of volcanic jets to adapt established empirical models of man-made jet noise to volcanic systems.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Geophysics and Petrology & Geochemistry Programs and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR)."

The project will address the following  questions: (1) is there detectable genetic diversity between  populations affected by known bottlenecks and barriers to  dispersal? (2) is genetic diversity sufficient to establish  relationships between populations and explain historic patterns of  dispersal across their range? (3) can genetic variability be used  to establish relationships of individuals within populations and  to assess the differential roles of the sexes in pioneering new  ranges or recolonizing old ones?

Using the muskox as a model, the   answers to these questions should increase understanding of the  population dynamics of a species that is sometimes constrained  from dispersal by climate, human activity and geographic barriers   and has apparently adapted to survive genetic bottlenecks caused  by these constraints and population fluctuations.  As disturbances  to the environment are likely to become more significant with  predicted global climate change and increasing human presence on  the earth, the ability to predict species' responses to change is  becoming more important if efforts are to be made to ensure their  survival.

Plants and animals routinely  experience small adjustments in these rhythms, often triggered by  intensity of light, to synchronize their internal clocks with the  passing seasons or changes in the environment.  Indeed, precisely  timed bursts of bright light can stop the daily cycle of the human  biological clock.  A major question is how photic signals are  transduced into physiological responses.  Two structures in the  brain that have been identified as playing a role in this response  are the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus and the pineal  gland.  These structures receive neural input from the retina of  the eye when it is stimulated by light.  It has been proposed that  some vertebrates also may possess extra-pineal, extra-retinal  photoreceptors, referred to as deep brain photoreceptors, which are  capable of entraining circadian rhythms.  At this time we do not  know the location, sensitivity, or most importantly the neural  connections of these putative receptors.  This project awards Dr.  Deviche a small grant for exploratory resesarch to address this  important problem.  He has found a model system in a species of  highly photoperiodic arctic bird that possibly could provide the  answers. Using an antibody that identifies rhodopsin-like  photopigments in the retina and the pineal, he will locate cell  bodies and terminals in the brain.  Light conditions will be  manipulated to determine whether light exposure stimulates the  expression of these photopigments in these brain cells.  If  successful, this will be the first demonstration that some cells  deep within the central nervous system are photosensitive.  These  results would open new avenues towards understanding the mechanisms  by which light stimulation reaches and alters th e nervous system to  influence biological timing, and will have impact also beyond  neuroscience to arctic biology and ornithology. Understanding the  basic neural mechanisms for timing could lead to treatment of  problems such as impaired attentiveness that affect human  performance during work shifts from day to night, or jet lag, or  other factors that make the internal clock out of sync with the  environment.  ***"

These conditions are present in permafrost regions and beneath the sea along the outer continental margins.  Consequently, methane hydrates are thought to be widespread in the onshore permafrost regions of the North American and the Russian Arctic and in the shallow continental shelves of the Arctic Ocean where subsea permafrost is found.  These gas hydrates are a potential and abundant source of energy, a major sink for global carbon, and could influence seafloor stability.<br/><br/>Low sea levels 20,000 years ago exposed the shallow continental shelves of the Arctic Ocean to the cold climate, allowing permafrost and stable gas hydrates to form in these shelves.  Climatic warming and changes in sea level warm the permafrost and destabilize the hydrates.  Methane gas is produced during hydrate destabilization and may eventually be released to the atmosphere. Permafrost temperatures are known to have increased 2-4oC during this century and current climatic models predict continued warming.  With present knowledge, it is not possible to predict the amount or timing of methane releases by gas hydrate decomposition as a result of permafrost, especially subsea permafrost, degradation.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigators will survey existing data on gas hydrate and permafrost conditions in the Russian Arctic land-shelf system to establish boundary conditions, properties, occurrence and distribution.

Reindeer herding in the Russian has perhaps never been faced with such rapid and sweeping changes as in this unstable time.  With the abrupt withdrawal of the large government subsidies that kept reindeer state farms operational, they must now adapt to the  changing political and economic conditions or risk failure -- not merely economic failure, but failure in their ability to provide the basic social service that rural Northern communities have come to depend on for their very survival.  A variety of restructuring options have been put into effect at different reindeer herding operations, but they have experienced dramatically varying outcomes.  Why are some thriving while others are struggling to survive, or even dissolving?  Reindeer herding is treated by administrators as just one of the many branches of the former Soviet economy that must now become privatized; but is reindeer herding as practiced today an enterprise that can deliver a product to market and a profit to its owner?  And is that the most important reason for its existence, from the point of view of those who practice it?  This research examines why reindeer herders and administrators choose the options they do, and evaluates the consequences of those choices.  The Chukotakan case provides valuable comparative data on the ways in which privatization and agricultural reform are implemented in the regions of the Russian Federation and the kinds of responses that are emerging to the rapid social change resulting from the post-Soviet transition."

The number and                    specificity of these plant-animal relationships generates much of               the biodiversity of the tropics.  Plants commonly use secondary                 compounds as defense against herbivores or as attractants for                   mutualists.  Chemically similar compounds may serve different                   functions in related plants.  The proposed research will                        elucidate a model system of plant-animal interactions by testing                the hypothesis that terpenoid resins, which function as floral                  rewards for bees in most species of Dalechampia, function in the                leaves, stipules, and floral bractlets of primitive species as a                defense against herbivores and/or pathogens, and play no role in                pollination.  Primitive species of Rhopalostylis, according to                  the hypothesis, should defend flowers and leaves against                        herbivores with resin, while offering pollinators some other                    reward, such as pollen or fragrances.  To test these ideas the                  proposed project will i) establish whether or not the terpenoid                 resins of glandless and gland-bearing species deter herbivores,                 by using resin extracts in feeding trials with natural                          herbivores; ii) establish whether or not the terpenoid resins                   inhibit microorganisms, by testing extracts in bioassays with                   microorganisms; iii) investigate the chemical relationships                     between the floral and vegetative resins by surveying and                       analyzing the compounds produced; and iv) make observations on                  the pollination of, and herbivory on, primitively glandless                     species of Dalechampia.  Information from this study will give us               greater insight into the chemical basis of plant-animal                         interactions, how such interactions evolve, and how novel                       mutualisms arise."

As a group, these seals are among the dominant top predators in Southern Ocean ecosystems, and the fluctuation in their abundance, growth patterns, life histories, and behavior provide a potential source of information about environmental variability integrated over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. This proposal was developed as part of the international Antarctic Pack Ice Seals (APIS) program, which is aimed to better understand the ecological relationships between the distribution of pack ice seals and their environment. During January-February, 2000, a research cruise through the pack ice zone of the eastern Ross Sea and western Amundsen Sea will be conducted to survey and sample along six transects perpendicular to the continental shelf. Each of these transects will pass through five environmental sampling strata:  continental shelf zone, Antarctic slope front, pelagic zone, the ice edge front, and the open water outside the pack ice zone. All zones but open water will be ice-covered to some degree. This component of the APIS program will examine seal nutritional physiology, using a suite of biomarkers and morphometric indices that reflect the health, body condition and nutritional status of seal populations. Measurements include blood and clinical markers, nutrition indices, lipid signatures and stable isotope signatures as well an array of protein markers. Comparisons will be made within and between species. This study will complement others on the health status of Antarctic ice seals. Better insight into the interplay among pack ice seals and biological and physical features of Antarctic marine ecosystems will allow for a better prediction of fluctuation in seal population in the context of environmental change.<br/><br/>"

This site lies in the                Eastern Arctic where the sky is dark enough to allow optical                    observations of the dayside auroral oval from late November to                  late January.  The station is instrumented with a TV all-sky                    camera, a 5 channel meridian scanning photometer, a riometer, and               also induction and fluxgate magnetometers.  Previous work                       established the spectural character and morphology of both the                  magnetic pulsations and the auroral forms in the dayside aurora.                That the strength and direction of the interplanetary magnetic                  field is directly related to the form and motion of the dayside                 aurora implying that the latter is an ionospheric signature of                  plasma entry at the magnetopause.  Correlation of the optical                   observations with simultaneous measurements of geomagnetic                      pulsations has resulted in a model of the magnetospheric                        structure associated with this correlation.  This proposal is to                support further the optical measurements required to test this                  model of the relationship of the dayside ionosphere to                          magnetospheric  boundary layer phenomena.

The  PI's  study  hibernating ground squirrels which lower  their  body  temperature  for periods of up to three  weeks  before  they spontaneously rewarm to normal summer body temperatures  for  a  short  period  (< 24 hours).  Following  this  brief  rewarming  period, hibernators return to another three  week  period  of reduced body temperature. This repetitive pattern  of  cooling and rewarming might seem paradoxical,  since  it  requires  the  burning  of a significant  amount  of  stored  calories  throughout  the  hibernation  season,  unless  the  pattern  meets a critical physiological need.  The  proposed  research addresses this phenomenon and represents the  first  comprehensive  analysis  of the temperature  sensitivity  of  gene  expression  in a hibernating mammal.  The  PI's  major  objectives  are  to  (1) identify potential  messenger  RNAs  (mRNAs)  that  become limiting during low body  temperature;  (2) determine the turnover of these mRNAs by measuring their  rate   of  synthesis  and  degradation  as  a  function   of  temperature;  and (3) determine the effect of  reduced  mRNA  concentration  on protein synthesis rate as  a  function  of  temperature.  Comparison  of  the  relative  rates  of  mRNA  synthesis   and  degradation  during  warm  and   low   body  temperatures  will result in a considerable  advancement  in  our   understanding   of  biological  adaptations   to   low  temperature.    This award also includes a teaching component. Most students  are   unskilled  with  the  process  of  scientific  inquiry  including   observation,  inference,  hypothesis  formation,  experimental   design,   data   collection,   analysis   and  interpretation.   To   explain   biological   concepts   and  understand the nature of biology, students must learn how to  think    c ritically,   reason   logically    and    evaluate  technological information effectively by being introduced to  the  methods,  values  and process of conducting  scientific  investigations.   The  educational plan  provides  this  for  students by giving them the opportunity to contribute to  an  ongoing research project focusing on molecular and metabolic  adaptations to hibernation. Students willing to produce  and  follow  an organized research plan should develop  a  deeper  understanding of natural phenomena surrounding them  and  an  appreciation  for the tools of scientific  inquiry  and  the  expansion  of  biological  knowledge.  Concurrent  with  the  proposed   undergraduate  educational  training,   excellent  teaching  assistant opportunities will foster  the  academic  growth  of  graduate students by integrating  education  and  research into their professional development.  Additionally,  critical  thinking skills will also be introduced  into  the  classroom   through  an  inquiry-based  teaching   approach.  Students  will  participate in problem  solving  activities,  debate,   hands-on  demonstrations  and  writing   exercises  involving  local  examples of scientific interest.  Finally,  cooperative  research and teaching interactions  with  rural  high  school teachers are proposed and include sharing ideas  and  experiences  gained  from inquiry-based  teaching,  and  development  of investigative laboratory experiences.  These  collaborative interactions  will  foster  the  establishment of valuable  linkages  with  rural  teachers  and increase the representation  of  Native  Alaskans  and  other  underrepresented  minorities  in   the  biological sciences."

Differences in ice types are the result of differences               in the environment in which the ice forms: frazil ice is formed in              supercooled sea water, normally through wind or wave-induced                    turbulence, while platelet and congelation ice is formed under                  quiescent conditions.  The fraction of frazil ice (which has been               observed to be generally in excess of 50% in Weddell Sea ice floes)             is an important variable in the energy budget of the upper ocean,               and contributes significantly to the stabilization of the surface               layers.

Complex engineering problems in control and system identification require considerable effort form the neural network engineer.  Multiple components are involved, including critic, action, and modeling units.  These reinforcement networks are capable of solving very difficult dynamic problems.  Another fascinating aspect of neuroengineering  is applying the concepts of neurocontrol and neuro-identification to model specific areas and activities of the brain.  In this work, neural network models based on the adaptive critic will be built up to incorporate the dynamics of avian birdsong learning.  The songs themselves are complex sequences of dynamic information, which must be represented internally in the brain as a ""modeling"" component.  The ""action"" component would be responsible for reproducing or creating a new birdsong, whereas the ""critic"" component guides the modeling and action components during the learning process.  Various parts  of the avian brain have been identified as taking part in the learning phase and production phase of avian singing.  Multiple factors may be incorporated into the model, as befits the knowledge of neurobiological researchers.  Lastly, the neural network models created may help direct neural biologists in their further ""wetware"" study of the brain.  It may provide a model of the general process of learning , which underlies behavior such as the human use of language."

The work will include both                 analysis of faunal remains from the previously excavated site of                Tunel and additional excavation at adjacent Playa Larga.  These                 two sites together provide information on over 7,000 years of                   prehistory in this region.

From the phase of exploration and study of the individual               components of the solar-terrestrial system, we are now entering                 the phase of understanding how these components are coupled to                  each other and how the sun-earth system works as a single whole.                Several recent studies and national and international program                   proposals have formulated broad objectives for STR during the                   next 10-15 years.  From these studies, the multidisciplinary                    nature of STR and the need for a global approach to the study of                the solar-terrestrial system emerge quite clearly.  So do the                   many potential benefits, intellectual, commercial and security,                 that science and society can expect from such an integrated                     study.  However, there is a need to distill from these broad                    objectives a modest, well-defined program that represents the S/T               contribution to the NSF's Global Geosciences Initiative.                                To this end, and in response to discussions with NSF, the               PI, Dr. Roederer, will lead an effort with the following tasks,-                        (I)  Examine the current status of scientific research in               S/T.                                                                                (II)  Identify new initiatives that are relevant to the                     National Solar Terrestrial Program (NSTP) and international S/T                 programs.                                                                          (III)  Formulate a plan which maximizes the scientific return                within modest budgetary requirements.                                               (IV)  Submit the plan ""Solar Terrestrial Research in Global                 Geosciences"" to NSF by November 1987.                                                   A steering meeting exists which will meet in Baltimore in               May 1987.  A workshop will be held in August 1987 and a final                   executive planning session in September 1987.  The end result                   will be a well defined set of major projects emphasizing ground-                based theoretical and numerical studies of interaction processes                governing the transfer of energy, momentum and mass in the solar                wind/magnetosphere/ionosphere/atmosphere system.

The PIs have been previously funded to collect and process approximately 260 zooplankton samples from the eastern Bering Sea during each of two cruises per year for the three BEST field seasons, to analyze the data, and to publish the results in peer-reviewed journals.  However, during field collection, the need for additional information was identified in order to ensure robust results.  In response to these needs, an additional 200 samples per year were collected during the BEST cruises.  This award funds the processing of those samples.<br/><br/>The entire rational of the BEST ecosystem study is based on the fundamental hypothesis that the eastern Bering Sea ecosystem is changing under the influence of climate.  The goal of the BEST research effort is to identify and quantify mechanistic links between climate and the ecosystem response.  An ecosystem responds to changes in climate forcing by altering the abundance, biomass and species composition of its constituent populations.  Therefore, a central requirement of the research is to collect and process a sufficient number of samples to determine robustly the state of the system during the study, estimate the direction or magnitude of change, if any, to validate or refute hypotheses concerning change, and to adequately validate or parameterize the lower trophic level models generated by other program participants.  Processing of the 200 extra samples per year will substantially improve our ability to detect statistically significant changes in zooplankton populations during the BEST program, thus helping to address the above requirements.<br/>"

The full EuroBABEL project is a collaboration of researchers from three countries, including the US, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. <br/><br/>This particular project focuses on the linguistic prehistory of the non-Austronesian languages the of Alor-Pantar archipelago of southeastern Indonesia. The Alor-Pantar languages represent one of only two groups of non-Austronesian languages in Indonesia outside of the island of New Guinea; the remaining languages of Indonesia belong to the Austronesian family. A comparison of pronouns suggests a genetic relationship between the Alor-Pantar languages and New Guinea languages located some 1000 km distant. Until very recently the 15-20 Alor-Pantar languages have remained among the least well-documented languages of Indonesia, but a surge in field work efforts over the past decade has resulted in a wealth of new language data. This project will bring new and recently-collected data to bear on the question of the linguistic origins and ultimate genetic relationships of the Alor-Pantar languages.<br/><br/>A major component of the analysis will be the reconstruction of the ancestral Proto Alor-Pantar language using the comparative method. To accomplish this the project will work closely with ESF partners to assemble recently-collected lexical and grammatical documentation and will supplement these with surveys of still-undocumented Alor-Pantar languages. These data will be used to infer sound changes which have occurred in the history of the languages. Evidence from sound changes will in turn allow the researchers to establish genetic subgroups and to evaluate potential genetic relationships with the languages of New Guinea.<br/><br/>An additional component of the analysis is the study of placenames, which represent one of the most highly endangered and least documented domain of linguistic knowledge in the Alor-Pantar languages. The structure and distribution of placenames provide insight into prehistory, often reflecting pre-historic settlement patterns. Placenames also provide indirect evidence of non-linguistic history, including past climate changes, since naming practices reflect human interaction with the environment at a fixed point in time. The GIS (geographic information systems) database compiled by this project will facilitate future inter-disciplinary investigations of population migrations and environmental changes and their relationships to language change."

Recent increases in the rate of environmental change in the Arctic pose considerable challenges to the survival of culturally and economically important, arctic-adapted species such as caribou. An ability to disentangle the roles of extrinsic processes, such as climatic or anthropogenic changes to the arctic habitat, and intrinsic processes, such as density-dependent resource limitation, in the dynamics of populations would provide key insights for conservation and management of the arctic biota. However, such efforts have thus far been hindered by the scarcity of long-term data for natural populations. Here, contemporary evolutionary and ecological approaches are integrated for the first time to produce long-term reconstructions of the population dynamics of one surviving and two extinct and arctic mammals: steppe bison, horses, and caribou. To achieve this, the largest, most densely sampled ancient DNA data sets to date will be produced, focusing on two environmentally distinct arctic localities with exceptional chronological control and detailed paleoenvironmental records going back at least 250,000 years. These data will provide the first opportunity to directly evaluate the role of environmental change on the long-term dynamics and extinction risk of arctic fauna. <br/><br/>A near-continuous time series detailing changes in the size and structure of bison, horse and caribou populations will be generated, spanning one complete glacial/interglacial cycle and several periods of major environmental change. Novel analytical techniques will be developed to (a) significantly extend the temporal range of paleogenetic reconstructions; (b) incorporate geographic and ecological data explicitly into demographic analyses; and (c) detect and quantify the role of intrinsic and extrinsic processes in the fate of natural populations of large herbivores. In addition, a detailed analysis of evolutionary information in mitochondrial DNA sequences will be performed, using high-throughput sequencing technology and novel experimental methodology to develop the first comparative temporal data set of complete mitochondrial genomes for sympatric (spatially and temporally) species. In addition, understanding how species respond to previous periods of climate change may improve our ability to forecast and mitigate adverse consequences of contemporary climate change for extant arctic species."

The intellectual merit of the work is that it will extract past climate information from a number of physical properties of the deep ice using a coupled fabric evolution and ice-sheet flow model. The focus will be on the deep ice-age ice at Siple Dome, where the ice-core record shows puzzling signals and where modeling results imply intriguing deformation patterns. The method will also be applied to the records from Byrd Station and Taylor Dome to ultimately form a basis for future analysis of the West Antarctic Divide core. The broader impacts of the project are that it will ultimately contribute to our understanding of the effects of anisotropy on ice flow dynamics in West Antarctica.

Sprites are large (~50km scale size) luminous events seen above thunderstorms. The investigators will make altitude resolved optical spectra at millisecond and higher time resolution. The observations will determine how sprites modify the mesosphere. Most sprites are associated with positive cloud to ground lighting strikes, and luminosity may extend from cloud tops up to ionospheric heights. Sprites lasts a few millisecond (ms) to 10's of ms with initiation commonly at an altitude of 70-75 km followed by both upward and downward propagation of luminosity. Sprites are predominantly red, but tendrils at low altitude are blue. Spectral measurements at TV frame rates (33 ms resolution) show the emissions to be from molecular nitrogen. Blue emissions from ionized nitrogen are expected to be present, but this has not been confirmed. The data available so far have not been able to answer firmly the central questions of how much energy is deposited into the mesosphere, and the resulting modification of the mesosphere by sprites. To address the time development of the energy deposition in sprites, the investigators will make spectral observations with ms time resolution. The primary instruments on a common mount will be an imaging slit spectrograph and two 16-channel multi-anode spectral photometers together with a TV imager to provide spatial context. The imaging spectrograph will provide better spectral resolution, while the spectral photometers will provide better temporal resolution. In addition, an imager will be deployed at a separate location to provide triangulated altitude information. The measurements will be compared to first principles models of sprite emissions to determine the energy deposition as a function of altitude and time. The investigators will also determine the amount of ionization and resulting changes in conductivity within the mesosphere caused by sprites. Two extended ground campaigns are planned. This research will provide clear understanding of sprite formation and propagation as a function of time and altitude. Spectral measurement will provide an unambiguous record of the neutral and ionized nitrogen emissions from sprites. Comparison of data obtained from this project with models of sprite emission will provide the time history of sprite energetics. The research will provide a balance of experimental and theoretical development suitable for a student working towards a PhD. The research plan also includes undergraduate cadets from the Air Force Academy in the calibration of the spectral photometers, and the gathering and analysis of the data. These experiences will provide the undergraduates a first hand look at real research, hopefully interesting them in further study at the graduate level. In addition the investigators plan a vigorous outreach program directed at high school students and teachers."

(4) Does evolution of particular mating systems lead to predictable changes in floral characteristics?  The investigators will focus on an ideal system for investigating the above questions--the tribe Collinsieae, a diverse group of native, annual herbs that show evidence of repeated evolutionary shifts between selfing and outbreeding strategies.  The research will involve field and laboratory studies to resolve precisely the mating systems of populations throughout the tribe, using genetic, developmental, and ecological data, and to reconstruct the dynamic history of mating-system change in the group.<br/><br/>Evolution of selfing is of special interest to biologists and geneticists, who have long recognized that it can rapidly cause the loss of genetic variation, expression of deleterious traits, and loss of evolutionary potential.  Different (conflicting) hypotheses proposed to explain evolution of selfing strategies have not been adequately tested and the basic question of whether selfing lineages can spawn outbreeding lines with long-term evolutionary prospects remains unanswered.  Resolving these issues would greatly advance evolutionary biology and is a primary goal of this investigation. <br/>"

This project is unique in that it utilizes general anesthetics to probe the receptor's molecular structure. Anesthetics exert a wide range of effects on these receptors, displaying different effects on different receptors.  Using cloned receptors and modern molecular techniques, this project will identify the differences between these receptors at a molecular level that give rise to these differential effects.  By utilizing this information, an improved understanding of the relationship between the site of drug interaction and the functional effects on the receptor can be achieved.   The focus on general anesthetics increases the scope of the project by enabling the mapping of several different functional regions of the receptor.  These functional regions may provide additional targets for drug development, thus permitting a ""fine tuning"" of the receptors function via novel pharmaceutical agents.<br/> New drug types developed as a result of this research would be potentially useful in the treatment and prevention of a number of human diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, age associated memory impairment, nausea associated with chemotherapy and withdrawal from drugs of abuse.  Since this project investigates fundamental structural and functional relationships of receptor proteins, this research will also increase our knowledge of other similar proteins - thus facilitating a broader understanding of protein/drug interactions.  In addition to scientific benefits, the educational impact of this project is also substantial.  Students from widely different educational backgrounds will conduct much of the proposed research.  High school teachers, high school students, undergraduate college students and graduate students will work as a team to accomplish the research goals of the project.

Forest productivity in the boreal biome is generally limited by the availability of nitrogen (N), and increased fire frequency causes increased opportunity for N to be lost from the ecosystem via combustion and post-fire losses to the atmosphere and water.  Understanding controls over these N losses following fire is important for predicting the long-term consequences of increased fire frequency for forest productivity and carbon cycling.  In this proposal, the investigators hypothesize that the functional traits of the plant species that initially colonize burned ecosystems will control the ability of the ecosystem to accumulate carbon and thus retain N following fire.  The researchers will test this hypothesis with a study of N loss in a boreal black spruce forest that burned in June 1999.  The research approach will entail an ecosystem-scale addition of a stable N isotope that can be tracked, combined with experimental manipulation of plant colonization.<br/>"

Sensitivity to the initiation of growth is examined by culture media amendments.

This ice serves as a habitat for highly specialized, distinct communities inside and at the underside of the ice.  The ice-related food web extends to higher trophic levels such as sea-floor dwellers, seals, and polar bears and, therefore, closely ties the sea ice, pelagic and benthic realms together.  The quality and duration of the sea ice cover varies significantly on decadal time scales.  In order to predict how future variations in ice cover might affect arctic ecology, a better knowledge of the present role of sea ice is needed.

Winter processes could be critical to this tundra-to-shrub transition, because larger and denser shrubs trap more snow, which leads to warmer soil temperatures during winter and could permit greater decomposition and mobilization of nitrogen from soil organic matter.  The goals of this research project include determining 1) whether snow trapped by shrubs in winter promotes biologically significant mobilization of nitrogen from soil, 2) whether shrubs take up nitrogen mobilized during winter and increase their growth, thus promoting shrub expansion, 3) whether shrub expansion promotes carbon loss from soil, as has been seen previously in fertilized tundra plots that have become dominated by shrubs, and 4) understanding how shrubs recover from being laid down by winter snow, and how snow affects their growth and mortality.  These goals will be addressed by field experiments manipulating snow accumulation and shrub architecture, and by measuring plant and soil carbon and nitrogen where shrubs have naturally expanded over the last 50 years. <br/> Expansion of shrubs may be the most widespread land surface change in the Arctic as climate warms.  Our results will help reveal the mechanisms underlying shrub expansion and their consequences for ecosystem cycling of carbon and nitrogen.

Early successes in applying paleopedological techniques to the recognition and correlation of terrestrial unconformities (sequence boundaries) have built largely upon paleosol-landscape models that were developed primarily from aggradational basin settings.  In contrast, relatively little attention has been paid to paleosol variability in an alluvial/coastal plain undergoing dissection during the falling stage on the relative sea level curve. This research will document the spatial variability of paleosols across a single interfluve surface in the Cretaceous (Cenomanian) Dunvegan Fm. with respect to distance from associated valley margins and the coeval paleo-shoreline.  The Dunvegan Fm. is ideally suited for this study because it is both spatially extensive and stratigraphically well understood; because coeval shallow marine and shoreline environments can be confidently correlated with nonmarine deposits updip; and because paleo-valley deposits have been mapped in detail and the distance from any interfluve paleosol to the valley margin can be fairly accurately determined.  Ten paleosols will be sampled from a single interfluve at distances from less than 1 km to more than 20 km from adjacent valley margins along a transect extending more than 250 km updip from the coeval shoreline.  Paleosols will be described in the field and analyzed for micromorphological features, geochemistry and mineralogy.  Micromorphological features will be quantified and paleosols will be objectively compared using a soil micromorphology index.  These paleopedological data will be used to reconstruct the pedosedimentary histories of these paleosols, to develop a paleosol-landscape model for dissected alluvial/coastal plain settings, and to assess the value of the soil micromorphology index for objective description and comparison of paleosols both within and between basins.<br/>"

Recently, both programs have identified the Arctic Human-Hydrological Relationship as a major research gap, and both recommend more research efforts to characterize this relationship across sectors of human activity and Arctic regions. Currently this relationship has been explored in only a few cases that mainly investigate how Arctic hydrologic changes influence northern society and culture. It is, however, important to note that the study of human impacts on the arctic hydrologic system is also a great challenge and is a major research gap in the ARCSS programs. While various human activities -- such as water use for industry and irrigation, and change of land use and land cover -- affect hydrology regimes, construction and operation of large dams and reservoirs make the most significant changes in regional-global hydrology systems.<br/><br/>Many large dams and reservoirs have been constructed mainly for flood control and hydropower generation in the northern regions/watersheds, and their operation substantially alters river streamflow, sediment and thermal conditions. Large dams directly and significantly regulate streamflow; they change monthly and seasonal discharge regimes over space and time, and they affect yearly streamflow characteristics at the basin scale. It is important to note that, relative to climatic effects, dam impacts are much more direct and often cause abrupt changes in regional hydrologic regimes, thus significantly affecting long-term trends, especially at seasonal and regional scales. Recent analyses of hydrologic changes in large Siberian Rivers demonstrate that, due to reservoir regulation, discharge records collected at the basin outlet do not always represent natural changes and variations; these records tend to underestimate the natural runoff trends in summer and overestimate trends for winter and autumn. <br/><br/>There is a need to document and understand to what extent large dams affect arctic hydrology changes. The PI's research will specifically seek to quantify how large reservoirs impact Siberian regional hydrologic changes. In addition, they will synthesize regional analyses from Canada, Nordic countries and Siberia to achieve a comprehensive pan-Arctic assessment of dam effect on the arctic hydrology system and its past change.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: Because reservoir regulation is very strong and direct in the northern regions, we must understand dam effects before we can determine hydrologic response to climate change and variation in the large arctic watersheds. Our current knowledge of reservoir effects on arctic hydrologic changes is incomplete and this limits our capability to understand the long-term changes observed in Arctic hydrologic system. This proposed research will clearly document dams and reservoirs in the northern regions and quantitatively assess their impacts on regional hydrologic changes. This knowledge is important to the ARCSS goal of a system-level understanding of the Arctic and its change. This research will produce naturalized streamflow data across Siberia; such data will be valuable for climate model validation and large-scale water budget analyses. These results will advance our understanding of the functions, interactions, and changes in the Arctic system and benefit national and international programs, such as the NSF/ARCSS, HARC, WCRP/GEWEX, and CLIC.<br/>"

Patterns of DNA sequence variation can provide suggestive evidence for a history of natural selection on a particular gene or set of genes, but these indirect inferences should serve as a stepping-off point for experiments to identify specific mechanisms of adaptation. Accordingly, the purpose of the proposed research project is to follow up a comprehensive survey of DNA sequence variation in the hemoglobin genes of Andean waterfowl to gain insight into the functional (and possibly, adaptive) significance of the observed amino acid polymorphisms. The goal of this project is to determine whether parallel amino acid substitutions in highland populations of eight species of Andean ducks have produced similar functional changes in hemoglobin-O2 affinity. This project will integrate DNA sequence data with functional experiments to identify possible mechanisms of adaptation, and will determine whether the same or different mechanisms underlie adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia in eight replicate lineages that independently colonized the high Andes. The research will provide information about the number and types of amino acid substitutions that are involved in potentially adaptive traits, and will also provide a point of contrast for studies of humans inhabiting high-altitude regions. The work will assemble a diverse team of collaborators from North America and South America, and will develop collaborations with high-altitude physiologists. A postdoc, graduate students, and undergrads, will be mentored by faculty conducting research in structural biology, biochemical physiology, and population genomics. Understanding the mechanistic basis of traits that underlie adaptation to high-altitude environments will be motivational for the conservation of Andean species, as well as their habitats.

This study focuses on the transition between the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM) and the onset of Neoglaciation, and on the step-like changes that occurred subsequently during the late Holocene. The millennial-scale cooling trend that followed the HTM coincides with the decrease in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation driven by slow changes in Earth?s orbit. Despite the nearly linear forcing, the transition from the HTM to the Little Ice Age (1500-1900 AD) was neither gradual nor uniform. To understand how feedbacks and perturbations result in rapid changes, a geographically distributed network of proxy climate records will be used to study the spatial and temporal patterns of change, and to quantify the magnitude of change during these transitions. <br/><br/>The researchers of this collaborative project will use lacustrine sediments to produce 13 new high-resolution proxy climate records of the past 8000 years. The study sites form two focus regions (eastern Beringia and the NW Atlantic) that generally coincide with the nodes of the surface temperature expression of the Arctic Oscillation (AO). This effort will nearly double the number of high-resolution lacustrine records that extend through the last two millennia, and will generate some of the first high resolution records that capture the HTM. During the HTM, summer sea-ice cover over the Arctic Ocean was likely the smallest of the present interglacial period; certainly it was less extensive than at any time in the past 100 years, and therefore affords an opportunity to investigate a period of warmth similar to what is projected during the coming century. This study focuses on lakes because lakes are the most widely distributed sources of proxy climate records that consistently extend through the post-glacial interval. <br/><br/>Because climate change is amplified in the Arctic, the climate signal preserved in arctic lake sediments should be stronger than elsewhere. The proxy records generated in this project will use conventional and newly emerging techniques to document the spatio-temporal patterns of abrupt environmental changes, and to derive quantitative estimates of past summer temperature and hydroclimate variables. Most lakes have been cored previously and show potential for generating high-quality proxy records. Five of the lakes contain laminated sediment with annually resolved records; others have high sedimentation rates (>0.5 mm yr-1) for sub-decadal resolution across the climate transitions. Confidence in the paleoclimate reconstructions will be bolstered by a multi-proxy approach, and by replicate lake records in each of the focus regions that will be used to distinguish basin-scale thresholds from regional-scale climate shifts. <br/><br/>This project builds on on-going climate-modeling experiments that use NCAR?s Climate System Model (CCSM3) to study the sensitivities of the arctic system to volcanism and solar variability. A new data-model comparison proposed for this study will test whether the most prominent changes in the arctic system during the past 8 ka, as reconstructed from the proxy records, can be explained by a plausible combination of system-component conditions coincident with prolonged volcanism. The experiments, conducted with NCAR collaborators, will focus on the elements of the Arctic system (e.g., AO and extent of sea ice) that participate in abrupt transitions, and that might elicit nonlinear changes in the future."

This area has the highest documented rates of coastal sedimentation with annual accumulation rates of about 10 million metric tons organic C per year, which approximately equals the amount of sediment accumulated over the entire pelagic zone of the World Ocean. Due to the specific features of sedimentation and lithogenesis in this area, much of this organic carbon survives decomposition, and is buried within seabed sediments. These sediments are frozen annually or seasonally, representing a substantial reservoir of potentially labile organic carbon. Global warming in the arctic region is predicted to be substantial, and possibly rapid, in next few decades. Upon the melting of permafrost, old stored carbon will be reintroduced into the modern carbon biogeochemical cycle, possibly acting as a strong source of methane to the overlying water and potentially the atmosphere. Additionally, extremely large amounts of more ancient (Pleistocene) methane are trapped as gas hydrates within and beneath the permafrost. This research aims to elucidate the present and future methane flux potential of sediments and permafrost in regions of the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. As a result of global warming, seafloor permafrost along the East Siberian Arctic Shelf may experience a pronounced change in thermal regime. Increased temperature may affect permafrost in several ways, ultimately leading to its degradation and enhanced CH4 release. An international, interdisciplinary research team will determine the distribution and stability of permafrost on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf and evaluate this area as a methane source to the arctic region. Cores from eleven locations will be obtained using dry drilling techniques. Rates of biological methane production and consumption (oxidation) will be quantified in permafrost and sediments at in situ and elevated temperatures. Natural abundance stable carbon and hydrogen isotope measurements will be used to quantify the age and source of methane collected from different sites and depths. These data will be used as input to numerical models, which will be developed to describe the thermodynamic and biogeochemical aspects of permafrost methane dynamics. Using field data and modeling, the current and future potential release of methane from offshore permafrost will be determined and a methane budget for the East Siberian Arctic Shelf will be constructed."

Iceland occupies a strategic position to monitor North Atlantic climate, as it is situated at the boundary between major oceanic and atmospheric circulation systems. Consequently, Iceland records the status of much of the northern North Atlantic region. This award will address Arctic warmth by reconstructing the status of Iceland's ice caps from changes in the physical properties of sediment accumulating in glacier-dominated lakes. Ice-cap modeling will provide quantitative estimates of past summer warmth consistent with reconstructions of the ice cap derived from the lake sediment study. The oxygen isotopic ratio (delta18O) of precipitation will be determined from the delta18O of chironomid (midge) head capsules, a common constituent of arctic lake sediment. The delta18O of Arctic precipitation is highly correlated with mean annual air temperature, providing quantitative temperature reconstructions. Chironomid delta18O provides quantitative estimates of past air temperatures from Arctic lakes, and circumvents persistent problems with low pollen productivity at high latitudes and with plant immigration delays. Changes in chironomid assemblages in the same sediment cores, tied to an Icelandic training set, will provide an independent estimate of summer temperature.<br/><br/>Three U.S. PhD students will be involved in this project. In addition, two Icelandic graduate students and one postdoc will be involved in a companion study with Icelandic collaborators.

By providing quantitative data on Holocene warmth and status of ice caps, this work will provide a key benchmark for General Circulation Models, especially those attempting to simulate thermohaline circulation. Results will be of great interest to Icelanders, who depend on their ice caps for hydroelectric power and as major tourist attractions. If Iceland's ice caps are at risk from projected global warming, this will have substantial economic impacts. This research will help constrain those risks."

In the Arctic, the history of the Amerasian basin has been inferred from the limited stratigraphic record exposed on the Canadian and American continental margins. During the last few years, an outpouring of data collected in the Arctic Ocean basin from satellites, airplanes, and submarines has been made available and compiled into revised and much improved maps and grids of bathymetry, gravity anomalies and magnetic anomalies. With these new data, it is now possible to formulate concrete, specific hypotheses about the history of the basin. Testing these hypotheses will require coordinated field programs.  <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:  A number of basic scientific problems can be addressed in the Amerasian Basin. Some of these problems are unique to the Arctic Ocean while others are framed by studies conducted at lower latitudes. Solutions of these problems will require new data collected throughout the basin. The expense of these cruises argues against continuing in the single investigator, single hypothesis, single cruise mode that is the typical NSF model. Making progress will require multiple coordinated, multi-disciplinary cruises. While the Amerasian Basin is clearly an oceanic basin, no mutually agreed upon plate boundaries are recognized. As a result, reconstructions of the paleo-geography of the northern hemisphere prior to the Cenozoic are largely hypothetical. Identifying these boundaries will help to decipher the plate tectonic history of the Mesozoic Arctic Ocean. The stratigraphic record of the Arctic Ocean contains a unique paleooceanographic and climatic record. Little of the Cenozoic and almost none of the Mesozoic record has been sampled. Dramatic changes have occurred since the Cretaceous through the Pleistocene, when ice sheets extended out into the basin, to the present day. Deciphering this history will complement the sediment and ice cores taken at lower latitudes and make it possible to study truly global paleoclimate for the first time. This work will be accomplished by scientific drilling, which would require a number of preliminary cruises collecting swath mapping and multi-channel seismic profiling to prepare.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The generation of earth scientists who began their arctic careers with International Geophysical Year (IGY), ice islands and Polar-class U.S Coast Guard icebreakers has retired. Their experience, enthusiasm and ideas are needed by the mid-career scientists who have focused on Arctic Ocean geology and geophysics and others, post-docs and graduate students who will advance this work in the future. The major objectives of this workshop are to make these connections, both domestically and internationally, build a community and develop a coherent plan for the future studies of the Amerasian Basin.<br/><br/>"

Two key unanswered questions are: How much of the elemental mercury initially deposited is converted to toxic methyl-mercury, and where does this methylmercury ultimately come to rest? Since cryospheric processes related to snow and ice in large measure determine the answers to these questions, this work sets out to study these processes. The processes studied straddle the Arctic Coast, have pan-Arctic significance, and have a direct impact on human and ecosystem health. <br/> <br/>The project has experimental and synthesis components. Along a transect from the Chukchi Sea inland to Barrow and Atqasuk, measurements will be taken of reactive bromine and mercury loading in the snow pack. Detailed observations will be made during mercury depletion events and during the snowmelt, comparing and contrasting the fate of mercury on land with that at sea. Post snowmelt samples from tundra, lakes, ice, and terrestrial and marine sediments will be analyzed and used to determine where and how much of the deposited mercury is converted to methyl mercury. Manipulation experiments will be used to better understand how mercury is entrained in the snow pack, and how it is released during the snowmelt. A series of weeklong retreats by the research team and selected others will be held to produce a synthesis of the Arctic Mercury System. By understanding and modeling the arctic mercury system, the group will assess how the impact of mercury pollution on human and biological systems is likely to be affected by the unprecedented changes in sea ice and snow conditions that are taking place in the Arctic today. <br/> <br/>Intellectual Merit of Proposed Activity: The research fills a gap in our current understanding of the Arctic Mercury System, namely what happens to atmospheric mercury after it is deposited. It also serves as a bridge, connecting detailed studies of atmospheric chemistry of mercury deposition with the large body of studies related to arctic mercury environmental loading and health risk. This work takes a systems approach to the mercury problem that is both essential and novel. <br/> <br/>Broader Impacts: Mercury is toxic and of great concern to arctic residents and officials. Results from this research will be useful in assessing how arctic mercury pollution is derived from global levels of mercury, and how that pollutant loading might respond to changes in sea ice and snow conditions. Results will be communicated to decision-makers and the public in a series of outreach activities that include traditional graduate student training, conference presentations, website publication, classroom visits, and through the production and publication of a children's book by an award-winning author. <br/>"

This award supports the cryospheric and oceano-graphic components of an integrated multi-disciplinary program to address these rapid and fundamental changes now taking place in Antarctic Peninsula (AP). By making use of a marine research platform (the RV NB Palmer and on-board helicopters) and additional logistical support from the Argentine Antarctic program, the project will bring glaciologists, oceanographers, marine geologists and biologists together, working collaboratively to address fundamentally interdisciplinary questions regarding climate change.   The project will include gathering a new, high-resolution paleoclimate record from the Bruce Plateau of Graham Land, and using it to compare Holocene- and possibly glacial-epoch climate to the modern period; investigating the stability of the remaining Larsen Ice Shelf and rapid post-breakup glacier response ? in particular, the roles of surface melt and ice-ocean interactions in the speed-up and retreat; observing the contribution of, and response of, oceanographic systems to ice shelf disintegration and ice-glacier interactions.  Helicopter support on board will allow access to a wide range of glacial and geological areas of interest adjacent to the Larsen embayment. At these locations, long-term in situ glacial monitoring, isostatic uplift, and ice flow GPS sites will be established, and high-resolution ice core records will be obtained using previously tested lightweight drilling equipment. Long-term monitoring of deep water outflow will, for the first time, be integrated into changes in ice shelf extent and thickness, bottom water formation, and multi-level circulation by linking near-source observations to distal sites of concentrated outflow.  The broader impacts of this international, multidisciplinary effort are that it will significantly advance our understanding of linkages amongst the earth's systems in the Polar Regions, and are proposed with international participation (UK, Spain, Belgium, Germany and Argentina) and interdisciplinary engagement in the true spirit of the International Polar Year (IPY). It will also provide a means of engaging and educating the public in virtually all aspects of polar science and the effects of ongoing climate change. The research team has a long record of involving undergraduates in research, educating high-performing graduate students, and providing innovative and engaging outreach products to the K-12 education and public media forums. Moreover, forging the new links both in science and international Antarctic programs will provide a continuing legacy, beyond IPY, of improved understanding and cooperation in Antarctica.<br/><br/><br/>"

However, it is currently unknown which regions of the pan-Arctic are most vulnerable to future changes. In order to begin to address the future change to freshwater availability on a pan-arctic scale, this team will use a system of arctic typologies to enable the integration of biophysical data with socio-cultural data produced regionally, such as demographics and water values. They will use mature data sets to study the strategic transformations of the high latitude water cycle.<br/><br/>Recent studies suggest that climate change will have a significant impact on arctic hydrology. Changes in the hydrologic cycle will affect both the presence of surface water and the thermal balance in soil. While preliminary evidence suggests a changing climate will have a significant impact on the hydrologic cycle in arctic regions, very little evidence is available to predict how the quantity of freshwater used by people is likely to change. Even less is understood about how hydrologic changes will affect the sustainability and culture of arctic residents.<br/><br/>The overall objective of this research is to use a wide array of existing data sets in a synthesis effort to describe the vital role of freshwater in the lives of people in the pan-Arctic, how it has changed in the recent past, and how it is likely to change in the future. The group will use a model to predict climate-induced changes in the hydrologic cycle and the resultant water stress on people at these high latitudes. Water-related stress will involve all of the key agents of change: climate change, land use/cover change, and water management by humans. They seek to address water stress in the pan-Arctic by testing hypotheses related to the 1) dominant types of hydrologic change at local, regional and continental scales, 2) the interplay between humans and hydrology over the pan-Arctic, and 3) future prognostication of the high latitude water cycle under changing climate and populations. An important component of this research is an attempt to bridge the gap between large, continental scale processes with those processes acting at local scales. <br/>"

These large animals are central to the cultural identity and sustenance of many indigenous peoples throughout the north.<br/><br/>Across arctic and sub-arctic landscapes, terrestrial lichens comprise a large proportion of the plant biomass. These assemblages of fungi, algae and cyanobacteria not only contribute to hydrology, nutrient cycling and atmospheric exchanges in the ecosystem, but are also consumed by caribou and reindeer. Pollutants deposited on lichens are dispersed via Rangifer into predators and humans and into soil and water systems along their migration routes. Lichens support many Rangifer herds in the depth of winter and in early spring before the majority of vascular plants resume growth. Consequently, the distribution and abundance of lichens are related to population dynamics and movements of Rangifer. Although lichens contain several potentially toxic compounds, Rangifer and its gastrointestinal microbes can adjust to utilizing the unusual structural carbohydrates in this forage. Exclusive consumption of lichen by captive reindeer, however, can result in mass loss and the net loss of nitrogen (N). Low concentrations of N in lichens may prevent animals from attaining a positive N balance especially at low food intakes. Inadequate dietary N compromises the maintenance of maternal tissues and limits the production of new tissues for fetal growth in pregnancy and milk for calves in spring. We propose a model of changes in body protein for northern deer to relate energy and N balance to dietary supplies. The model predicts changes in the concentration and isotopic enrichment of the catabolite urea in relation to tissue proteins and their products (creatinine, hydroxy proline, methyl histidine).<br/><br/>The proposed research will define mechanisms for conserving body N in Rangifer during pregnancy, and quantify a predictive model of body protein loss. Two PhD students will participate in the project. We propose two experiments with repeated measures of captive reindeer fed formulated diets or lichens. The first experiment will determine the dynamics of N through gestation; we will combine measures of food intake and excretion to assess N balance using tracer techniques and isotopic enrichments, with a validation of these methods in non- reproductive animals during spring. The second experiment will focus on the digestive and metabolic responses to lichens; we will determine intake, digestion, digesta flow and absorption, and recycling of waste N. Indirect measures of body composition will be used throughout to determine changes in body protein and fat in relation to diet and season.<br/><br/>Describing the interrelationships between lichen ranges and Rangifer populations requires long-term monitoring and management because lichens grow so slowly, but accumulate biomass over many years. This project will provide new data on metabolic responses of Rangifer to the nutritional constraints of northern ecosystems and a tool for understanding the importance of lichens to Rangifer populations. These data will provide a basis for assessing the contribution of migrating herds to N and mineral cycling in tundra systems. Such an increased understanding of herbivore dynamics in the arctic also will have direct implications to other arctic ruminants (i.e. moose and muskoxen) with similar adaptive physiological mechanisms for protein and energy conservation.<br/>"

The program will be                        patterned after the successful 1987 summer program conducted at                 the Geophysical Institute.  The purpose of the program is to give               undergraduates majoring in physics and closely related areas                    experience in fields of research that are conducted at the                      Geophysical Institute.  In this program interns are assigned to                 work with individual principal investigators who assign the                     specific projects.  In addition there will be a series of weekly                lectures and additional field trips exposing the interns to other               fields of research.  Questionnaires filled out by the interns and               exit interviews conducted at the end of the summer indicate the                 program had positive impact in directing them toward graduate                   school and pursuing a career in the physical sciences."

This  is done by providing summer educational work in which  undergraduates become interns participating in the research  activities of the Geophysical Institute.  Research topics available  in this program concentrate on space physics, aeronomy and global  change (atmospheric science), but also include, ice and solid Earth  topics within the Geophysical Institute, and solid state physics  and laser physics at the Physics Department.  The aim is to  encourage \the undergraduates to continue their education in  graduate school and become research scientists.  In this program,  the interns are assigned to conduct research with principal  investigators who direct their work and serve as mentors through  their internship.  There is a common program of weekly lectures and  field trips designed to expose interns to fields of research beyond  the scope of their own projects.  Through their close relationship  with their mentors, contacts with graduate students, attending  seminars, lectures and thesis defenses, and participating in field  trips, the interns gain a first hand perspective on life and work  as a research scientist."

This GEM working group was approved by the GEM steering committee at the 1997 Snowmass GEM workshop."

Specifically, a generalized transport equation                 is adapted for application to electron transport, without and                   with an acceleration term, to proton/hydrogen atom beam, and to                 hot atoms produced by auroral collisional interactions.

It addresses several interesting and unresolved problems about the energy transfer between particles and waves and the thermal plasma.  These problems include the energy deposition of superthermal electrons to the thermal plasma, and the energy transfer between ring current ions and waves.  The investigations will utilize a code which has been developed over the past 6 or 7 years under a variety of NSF and NASA support.  This proposal utilizes the code particularly for storm-time modeling and will contribute to the GEM inner magnetosphere and storms campaign."
