A unique combination of activities are being offered that provide educational and research opportunities for PIPESTEMS scholars in partnership with the University of Tulsa, University of Oklahoma-Tulsa, Oklahoma State University, and OSU Center for Health Sciences. This project complements and builds on an NSF supported biotechnology program (0602744).<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The activities from this project are resulting in increased enrollment, retention, and degree completion of STEM students, especially underrepresented and female populations. There are intensive collaborations with existing student support services departments at the college, similar student-focused programs such as Tulsa Achieves Scholarship, Honors Scholars, and Achieving the Dream program student cohorts, and higher education institutions and business partners who assist with transfer and career placement upon degree completion."

SEEDBEd is adapting existing biotech-related instructional materials for use in middle and high school science courses, providing teachers with relevant professional development, and offering students an articulated educational pathway in biotechnology from middle school to college. The goals of the project are to (1) increase middle and high school students' knowledge of biotechnology and biotechnology careers, (2) increase middle school and high school teachers' knowledge of biotechnology content and reform-oriented pedagogy (for example, inquiry-based learning), (3) increase the number of high school graduates who enter TCC's biotechnology technician program, and (4) engage TCC faculty in biotech-related professional development. <br/><br/>The project is achieving its goals by (1) offering summer biotechnology training academies for middle and high school teachers and high school students, (2) providing industry-based internships and additional training courses to TCC faculty, (3) developing ""biotechnology learning modules"" for use in middle schools science courses and ""Biotech Footlockers"" for use in high school science courses, (4) creating a dual-credit biotechnology course for high school students, (5) forging articulation agreements between TCC and area universities (for example, Oklahoma State University), and (6) producing manuals that permit institutions in other areas to replicate SEEDBEd. An external evaluator is conducting question-driven summative and formative evaluations. The project is disseminating project materials and findings via a project website, local media outlets, presentations/poster sessions at state and national science and education conferences, journal articles, and a curriculum clearinghouse (Bio-Link).<br/>"

Discovered nearly one hundred years ago, it took scientists more than four decades to achieve a general understanding of this phenomenon. Soon after, practical applications of superconductivity began emerging. Probably, the most well-known of those is Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Since 1986 physicists have faced a new challenge, the discovery of unconventional superconductors, which defied conventional understanding. The basic concept of superconductivity theory is the formation of Cooper pairs, ?quasiparticles? consisting of two-electrons that transport current without resistance (a supercurrent). The dimension of a Cooper pair is of the order of a thousand atomic sizes and a pair?s mass is about 2.5 times that of an electron. Knowledge of these parameters is important both for the theory and for practical applications. Surprisingly enough, experimental values of these key characteristics have not yet been experimentally established for any superconductor. This individual investigator award supports a project which goal is to measure the size and the mass of the Cooper pairs in conventional superconductors. The experiments will be performed using the most advanced nuclear techniques of condensed matter physics. Direct involvement of community college students constitutes a major educational merit of this project. <br/><br/>****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****<br/>The principal microscopic intrinsic parameters of superconductors, important for both superconductivity theory and for practical applications, are the London penetration depth at zero temperature and the Pippard coherence length. To date the experimental values of these parameters have not been established for any superconductor. This individual investigator award supports a project to directly measure the London penetration depth and the Pippard coherence length in classical Pippard (extreme Type-I) superconductors, specifically in Al, In and Sn. Taking into account that the Pippard coherence length represents the size of the Cooper pairs and the London penetration depth is associated with the mass of the quasiparticles, the project is targeted at obtaining experimental values of these key characteristics of the Cooper pairs for the indicated materials. Values of the microscopic intrinsic parameters will be obtained from the profile of the magnetic field penetrating into the superconductors in the Meissner state. The magnetic field profiles will be measured using polarized neutron reflectometry, low-energy muon spin rotation spectroscopy and beta-detected NMR techniques. Direct involvement of community college students constitutes a major educational merit of this project."

To help meet these needs, this project will develop an Industrial Maintenance Technician pathway to prepare engineering technicians who have electromechanical experience. This project will develop a Business and Industry Leadership Team with representatives from electromechanical and manufacturing industries to ensure the pathway meets the needs of local employers. With this guidance, faculty will update the existing curriculum, acquire new instructional equipment, and provide students with flexible access to the existing fabrication laboratory. These changes are expected to raise enrollment, retention, and graduation rates of Engineering Technology and Electronics Technology students. Through targeted outreach and mentoring, this project also aims to increase the percentage of female students seeking technical certificates or degrees. <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to increase and broaden participation in the college's technology degrees to meet the local demand for electromechanical technicians. The specific aims designed to achieve this goal include: 1) implementing a new industrial maintenance technician pathway to increase student enrollment, retention, and graduation rates; 2) developing a flexible learning lab to meet student needs; 3) expanding industry involvement to promote career paths for students; and 4) assessing success of the project and disseminating project outcomes and lessons learned. Curriculum improvements will include developing courses in non-destructive testing and industrial robotics, and revision of courses in motor controls, programmable logic controls, and hydraulics and pneumatics. The new pathway will use stackable credentials that allow entry at each level of the pathway, thus serving students who need specialized training to immediately enter the workforce and students who need to start with the basics. The nationally recognized training track of Certified Production Technician will be embedded as a vital first step. With the Business and Industry Leadership Team in place, industry partners will be intimately involved with the program?s design, and will enrich the program by providing speakers, industry tours, and other resources. The results of the project, curriculum, and pathway will be disseminated with regional and national partners. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
