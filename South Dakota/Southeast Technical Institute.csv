Students are enrolled in one of seven information technology or engineering technology programs of study that lead to an Associate of Applied Science degree. The project especially recruits women, minorities and persons with disabilities in the two cohorts. The project has comprehensive student support services, strong partnerships with the high technology industry and scholarship support to ensure persistence until graduation. Project guidance is provided by a diverse group of faculty and non-faculty advisors. Implementation strategies include recruitment based on community partnerships, selecting students using an application process incorporating letters of recommendation and personal essays, development and utilization of an Individualized education and career plan for each participant, special monthly seminars for students, and integration of work-based learning activities to provide career mentoring and real world applications of the knowledge and skills learned in the classroom."
