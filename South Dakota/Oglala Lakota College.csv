This planning proposal is unique because: The application would benefit students of the only two-four-year accredited Tribally Controlled Colleges in the Nation, in addition to two-year Tribal Colleges. South Dakota National Science Foundation Statewide Systemic Initiative has committed comprehensive technical assistance to enhance the planning process. Resources provided by the SSI will significantly increase the likelihood that Oglala Lakota College will be able to develop a successful plan, and further to implement new SEM programs for American Indian students. Oglala Lakota College proposes to fully enhance telecommunication systems through collaborative effort in the implementation stage of this initiative in order to serve American Indians nationwide. South Dakota is a small state where collaboration among Institutions is extensive and permits maximizing of scare resources. Oglala Lakota College proposes a six month comprehensive planning process to develop four-year cooperative degrees. Cooperative degrees could than be offered through other institutions including two-year Tribal Colleges, in addition to Oglala Lakota Colleges' offering and thus significantly increase the number of students impacted."

Our long-term <br/>goal is to train a pool of highly skilled scientists and lab technicians who will serve<br/>their communities as self-employed entrepreneurs or hired employees. Also, one of <br/>the major shortcomings of our SMET programs is the lack of lab facilities with modern <br/>analytical equipment. This creates a disadvantage for our students at every level of <br/>their career.<br/><br/>We propose a multifaceted approach to develop the technological infrastructure of our<br/>institution and the reservation as a whole.  We will build a research center housing <br/>several federal and state certified labs that will provide us with the capacity to conduct<br/>research and routine analytical work in the areas of chemistry, environmental science, and <br/>biology.  Collaboration agreements with three faculty members at SDSM&T and Black Hills<br/>State University in these areas are procured for this proposal.  We will actively seek <br/>partnerships with tribal agencies to provide research and analytic services. This insures<br/>that a significant portion of the funding allocated by tribal agencies would be re-infused<br/>into the reservation economy. This would also sustain the project beyond NSF funding.<br/><br/>Our faculty and students will be trained on the equipment by the collaborators and<br/>through industrial short courses, workshops and seminars.  Both collaborators and <br/>faculty will initiate research projects involving our students utilizing the new equipment. <br/>We will strengthen our curriculum by developing new analytical lab classes and by<br/>enhancing existing sciencecourses. Finally, students and faculty will reach out to <br/>reservation communities to help them address their concerns about economic <br/>development and the environment.

PROGRAMS: Oglala Lakota College and Sinte Gleska University will develop and administer bachelor's degree programs in Environmental Science and Software Engineering, and a pre-engineering associate degree in science. The degree programs will be extended to Cheyenne River, Standing Rock, and Sisseton Wahpeton Community Colleges through a distance learning mode. These Tribal Institutions, collectively called the Oyate Consortium, are Tribally chartered, and serve distinct American Indian populations - a population which is significantly underrepresented in SEM education. The model developed can be easily replicated in the other twenty-six Tribal Colleges. MANAGEMENT: Core management will consist of a Principal Investigator, a SEM Curriculum Specialist/Co-Principal Investigator, and the Sinte Gleska Site Coordinator and Vice President. In years two to five site coordinators from the three other Consortium member colleges will join the team. The Principal Investigator will report directly to the OLC President. SPECIAL FEATURES: Oglala Lakota College and Sinte Gleska University, the only accredited graduate and four-year degree granting Tribal Institutions, have recently gained land-grant college status. The Oyate Consortium is unique because of strong collaboration among Tribal colleges and with other universities and industry. This initiative, the first ever for Tribal College SEM program development, has potential for unusual impact because Tribal Colleges are community and nation-builders with the special mission of helping tribes which are sovereign nations, become more self-sufficient. Oyate Tribal Colleges are unique because they reach students who are not served adequately by ordinary universities. These are students who live and work on geographically isolated reserva tions, hold cultural values not appreciated by mainstream institutions, or who have extensive family responsibilities. The NSF Model Institutions for Excellence initiative offers a unique opportunity for the Oyate Tribal Colleges and their twenty-six Tribal counterparts to reach the underrepresented American Indian students, and to bring academic and technical expertise to Tribal nations in ways that may make the difference between extinction and tribal self-sufficiency."

Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will inform the body of knowledge about the importance and conduct of pre-college and undergraduate research experiences in recruiting and retaining underrepresented individuals into STEM studies, and preparing the next generation of STEM professionals. The connection of students to research is an important step in retaining students who are more likely to pursue advanced degrees. For those students entering the workforce directly from a tribal college it is equally important that they have a well-defined skill set in mathematics, science, and technology for entry into the STEM workforce. The project also advances objectives of the STEM+Computing Partnerships program through its multidisciplinary STEM research on teaching and learning.<br/><br/>The specific activities are to: engage K-12 students through science fairs, bridge high school graduates through a shared research activity with a K-12 science teacher-mentor, develop decentralized mathematics and scientific-writing learning communities, continue high-quality undergraduate research, develop discovery-based physics and ethnomathematics enrichment activities for mathematics courses, and provide for student and faculty scientific dissemination of discipline specific and educational findings through publishing in peer-reviewed journals. The improvements in STEM recruiting, retention, persistence, and completion that will be realized through these strategies will be sustained through programmatic improvements and departmental alignment with Oglala Lakota's strategic plan and enrollment management plan.  Woksapi Kici Woitinze strengthens STEM education and undergraduate research through: 1) design, adaptation and assessment of innovative educational strategies to increase the capacity and effectiveness of the college to attract, retain, and educate students in STEM, graduate students prepared to pursue further study at the baccalaureate or graduate level, or to join the STEM workforce; 2) dissemination of successful educational models and methods for STEM education in a primarily Native American, poverty level, female community within a decentralized Tribal College campus setting; and 3) advancing scientific understanding in areas relevant to the Oglala Tribal Nation including: the effects of climate variability on the ecology of midwestern rangeland steams, advances in sustainable housing, biofuels and medicinal plant extract processing, air and water quality analysis, the conservation status and genetics of box turtles and the health and behavior of bison, and descriptions of the stratigraphy Eocene and Miocene aged terrestrial deposits and fossils by researching and publishing on these items in peer-reviewed journals with academic and tribal program collaborators."

To meet this goal, Oglala Lakota College served as the lead institution of the Oyate Consortium, a group of five tribal colleges located in South and North Dakota, which focused on developing STEM degree programs targeting a Native American student base.  Considering the Consortium started from ground zero in terms of facilities, degrees offered, and qualified faculty, the three remaining partner schools, OLC, Sitting Bull College and Sisseton-Wahpeton Community College have been very successful in building strong science, math and technology programs.  <br/><br/>In 1995 there were no STEM degree programs at any of the Consortium schools.  Today there are 112 degree seeking students enrolled in Interdisciplinary Environmental Science, Information Technology, Natural Science, SEM, and Computer Science.  To date, the schools have graduated 12 students with Bachelor degrees in Interdisciplinary Environmental Science, and three transfer students have received their degrees from other four-year institutions.<br/> <br/>During Phase III, OLC plans to offer STEM Bachelor degree programs to 8 more two-year tribal institutions via distance education.   The objective is to expand the at-distance student base from the current number of 16 at the two other Consortium schools to a total of 91 and make an even broader impact in Native American science education. <br/>The intellectual merit of the program will be demonstrated through the model developed by OLC for increasing STEM students from tribal colleges.  The broader impacts are the increased production of Native American scientists. At the conclusion of Phase III, this model will be available for distribution to other tribal schools that wish to either begin, or expand, STEM programs.  The MIE program has allowed OLC to meet and solve the problems associated with developing a successful STEM initiative at a tribal college.  This includes administration buy-in, needs analysis, infrastructure development, faculty recruitment, student support, and building regional partnerships to expand undergraduate research project opportunities and collaborations. <br/> <br/>Phase III will allow the MIE program to wind down and become institutionalized.

This <br/>capability will be developed through a Pre-Engineering Education Collaborative (PEEC) <br/>established with the College of Engineering at the South Dakota State University (SDSU) and the <br/>South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT), and is referred to as the <br/>OLC/SDSU/SDSMT PEEC (OSSPEEC).  The project will establish collaborative offerings of <br/>gateway and bottleneck courses that occur in the first two years of engineering curricula coupled <br/>with on-reservation hands-on laboratory and service learning experiences on the PRR that will <br/>increase Native American student retention in pre-engineering and engineering programs across <br/>South Dakota.  A major result of this project will be the establishment of a complete two-year pre- <br/>engineering curriculum at OLC, which will enable our students to enter any four-year <br/>undergraduate engineering program at the junior level. Further, this project will make an <br/>additional unique or radical step in the transformation of classical engineering education at the <br/>state colleges participating in the collaboration. <br/>We propose to collaborate to develop and offer the courses required for an integrated two-year <br/>pre-engineering program at OLC and to increase the success of OLC transfer and other Native <br/>American students at SDSU and SDSMT through shared research, internship experiences, and <br/>community building in the third and fourth years of an engineering program. The project will be <br/>unique in the United States in that during the collaborative process of building OLCs pre- <br/>engineering capacity, OLCs faculty and students will be helping to transform the concept of the <br/>first two years of the engineering curriculum at SDSU and SDSMT.  This will occur through the <br/>integration of project based service learning and undergraduate research projects on the Pine <br/>Ridge Reservation, which will involve professors and cohorts of students from SDSU and <br/>SDSMT. Also, these projects will cultivate closer ties among our institutions and OST Tribal <br/>Agencies through collaborative summer research and internship opportunities on the Pine Ridge <br/>Reservation that will lead to the development of future collaborative NSF research proposals."

The vision of the Magakata Woslolye Oaye program is<br/>to develop a model to strengthen science leadership at Tribal Colleges.<br/>The three goals of the Magakata Woslolye Oaye program are to:<br/>1. Train existing Oglala Lakota College STEM faculty to become Principal<br/>Investigators and leaders and increase the number of funded original research<br/>projects.<br/>2. Use existing infrastructure and resources to improve academic coursework and<br/>student learning by incorporating localized original research projects and<br/>community based service-learning projects.<br/>3. Adapt the existing commercial enterprise to a more sustainable socialized<br/>enterprise model.<br/>To reach these goals, three STEM faculty members will design a research project to<br/>answer an environmental question relative to the Pine Ridge reservation. Each faculty will<br/>serve as a team leader, recruit, and train four undergraduate students to work on the research<br/>team. In addition, they will serve as the project Principal Investigator and guide the team in<br/>writing a proposal to submit to a local review panel to receive project funding from the OLC<br/>Phase II program."

This precollege program addresses academic support and career  guidance for a large number of students at the elementary, middle  and high school levels.  The program indicates an excellent record  of influencing transition into post-secondary institutions.  The  high school graduation rate among participants is 100 percent.  Complementing this record is an ACT performance average which  exceeds the national average.  SKILL's participants have also  received several local and national awards.  There is evidence that  the SKILL's model for academic reinforcement and support has  attracted the attention of other academic institutions.    SKILL has reached a relatively large number of American Indian   students (3,000), fostering their interest in math and science.   The program shows good success in student retention and transition  to college from high school.  Twenty of the 24 original first year  students graduated from the SKILL program in 1996 and all applied  for admission to a university and identified a major in science or  engineering.  The strengths of the nominee include:      .  Continuity of focus on Native Americans is clear and very           distinctive.    .  Early and sustained intervention.    .  Demonstrated staff dedication and leadership.    .  Holistic approach to supplemental learning that covers             elementary through high school students.    .  Large number of experiments flown on space shuttle missions.    .  Promotion of dual course enrollment.    .  Summer residential activity for eligible high school students.         In summary, this is a holistic approach to supplemental learning.   The program intervenes at key grade levels at which precollege  students encounter difficulty in science and mathematics.  This  latter activity has the potential of influencing systemic change."

Most importantly, the students will also work together on application based engineering research projects that will introduce the students to the field of engineering and demonstrate the application and relevancy of engineering to the needs of their community. As the students progress they also will be exposed to the mainstream university and plan their transition to the four year engineering program there. Native American students who have already successfully transferred to the four year engineering school will advise and guide them. Faculty from the four year institution will also serve as mentors to the students so they learn more about the students and their background well before the students enroll in the four year institution."

Meetings will be held to finalize plans and determine the best and most appropriate scientific protocols for conducting the study.  The proposal will have a significant impact on students at the tribal college who will learn scientific methods (chemical and biological) to determine effects on the ecosystem of the re-introduction of the bison.  The proposal will hopefully lead to a better understanding of the basic science of how ecosystems change as a result of introducing bisons and will also provide scientific data that would enable better management of re-introducing animals in established ecosystems."
