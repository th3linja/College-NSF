The purpose of MVTP is to recruit, retain, and graduate increased numbers of students who are fully able to own and operate their own vineyard, or are fully employable in any commercial-scale mechanized vineyard in the Midwest. The activities undertaken teach STEM skills to operate and maintain commercial-scale equipment utilized in mechanized vineyard management and enhance students' employability. The goal of MVTP is to establish a career pathway to increase the percentage of rural, underrepresented, nontraditional, and veteran students recruited, retained, and graduated in order to meet workforce demands.<br/><br/>HIghland Community college (HCC) provides students with learning experiences about the STEM inherent in mechanized vineyard management. HCC enhances its current viticulture curriculum by creating three courses specific to mechanization in the vineyard. As vineyards swell in numbers and acres and labor becomes more scarce, mechanization is gaining in relevance in a traditionally labor-intensive industry. This project is educating students and entrepreneurs to adapt to these changes in the grape industry. All evidence points toward an expanding industry demanding more and better educated employees. The results of the project are being disseminated statewide through college affiliation with state and regional industry organizations, and national dissemination is being accomplished through association with the VESTA National Center of Excellence."

Multimedia learning materials are to be aligned with industry standards and deliverable via the Internet to supplement and complement the current curriculum; 2) To integrate the developed materials, modules, and the remote laboratory into two-year college wind technology programs to sustain workforce development in the field of wind power, with three community colleges as evaluation sites; and 3) To disseminate the materials, modules, and the remote laboratory nationwide via the NSF/ATE National Center for Manufacturing Education, the National Engineering Technology Education Clearinghouse, and ATE TV. The proposed professional development workshops for two-year college faculty members are to provide an additional channel for dissemination.<br/>The co-PI will identify technician programs aimed at or serving under-represented populations in the Northern Illinois area and make in-person presentations to the faculty of these programs aimed at making them aware of the potential uses of the modules."

Also, the computers are used for problem solving in applied mathematics and engineering courses and to teach Fortran and CAD to engineering students. A scientific computer literacy course required of all science and mathematics majors uses the laboratory. Students are able to collect, store, and analyze large quantities of data from rapidly changing phenomena. Through interfacing, the computers act as a variety of instruments and, at the same time, provide students with valuable experience in using computers. The grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match for the NSF award."
