This is being accomplished by introducing a series of new experiences using contemporary computer and video technology in physics. A microcomputer is used in the areas of force, motion, temperature, and radiation to perform data collection, analysis, and graphing; and is used to construct, execute, and display physical simulations in mechanics. Stop- action videotapes are used to collect data in projectile and rotational motion. Microcomputers and video technology provide immediate feedback that makes possible a larger number and variety of trials and motivates students to probe in greater detail.The grant is providing software and hardware for six, networked, color Macintosh II workstations equipped with a Universal Lab Interface with appropriate sensors and probes. The grant also is providing a shared LaserWriter II, modem, CD player, scanner, high resolution video camera, and playback deck. This support revitalizes the physics courses at JJC and provides current technology much more quickly than would otherwise be possible.This project is encouraging students to continue study or to support science by improving their experiences in physics, increasing science literacy, helping to prepare JJC's physics courses for the next century, and stimulating other community colleges to adapt this approach.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal sources."

It will provide 15 intensive workshops (five each year) for two-year college physics teachers at several qeoqraphically-dispersed two-year college campuses. One set of workshops will acquaint participants with the development and implementation of (1) microcomputer-based laboratories in mechanics and heat; (2) digital video, modeling, and microcomputer-based laboratories in electricity, magnetism, and opticsi (3) physics simulationsi and (4) active learning problem-solving strategies using conceptual exercises and overview case studies. The fifth workshop will be a working conference on introductory physics that will provide previous workshop participants an opportunity for sharing, gaining additional experiences, and discussing new developments and technologies. Each workshop will be led by two, two-year college physics professors and two or three university/college physics professors who play a major role in developing these areas. These workshops will provide participants with applications of the recent developments and findings of physics education research. As a result, participants will be able to evaluate these developments and will return to their campuses to begin implementing the workshop activities. Thus, these workshops, as they have done in the past, will facilitate the rapid incorporation of this knowledge and technology at two-year colleqes. The impact of the workshops will be reinforced by the continuation of a networking system that employs a microcomputer bulletin board system, an Internet access system, and a newsletter. The ultimate goal of this project is to help two-year college students develop a stronger understanding of classical and contemporary physics. The task of updating physics programs at two-year colleges is difficult, but essential, for the nation and for science because of the lar ge number of students, particularly women and minorities, attending two-year colleqes."

It will add to the local, regional, and national understanding of learning as it enhances student retention, performance, graduation, and peer support networks. A structured research study will be used to determine the impact of course specific tutoring, mentoring, and reflective journaling among students in STEM courses. The project will also assess and track the metacognitive skills that students use to advance their scientific thinking. Data reflecting the activities will be used to improve the program for all participants, as well as inform the academic community through conference papers and presentations at national and regional conferences. Each of these areas will be evaluated by an external evaluator using surveys, rubrics, and performance in specific courses to gather both quantitative and qualitative information about the project. Due to the demographics of the institution and the targeted recruitment of women and other underrepresented groups from both high schools and the college, the project will help to diversify the workforce.<br/><br/>To increase the number of academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who begin and complete a STEM program of study, the college will integrate scholarships and academic support with STEM faculty mentoring, reflective journaling, social cohorts, hands-on experiential learning through relevant research projects, and exposure to industry leaders and topics to provide scholars a pathway to success in STEM fields. Involvement in STEM classes, increased faculty mentoring geared to specific student needs, and reflective journals will encourage students to embrace the STEM community and find their own identity within it, while simultaneously learning how to mentor the next generation of scientists. Information gathered during classes, mentoring, reflective journals, student evaluations will inform the wider STEM community at the college, as well as increase awareness of student group building within the college student academic and support programs."

The primary objective for this project is to integrate sustainable energy technology practices within technical programs at the college and implement a new Certificate in Sustainable Energy Technology. The second objective of the project is to develop pathways for entry into the emerging sustainable energy field by providing intensive project based learning and dual credit enrollment opportunities for students in grades 7-12, as well as professional development for middle school and high school teachers.<br/><br/>In assessing the needs of region around Joliet, Illinois through direct consultation with industry partners and regional workforce development boards, it was determined that the technical programs of the college produce an adequate and well trained workforce. However, to become more competitive and meet the strategic objectives of the region, employers continuously cited that employee retention and development should focus on the green and sustainable areas of their respective disciplines. In addition, industry partners cited the need for multi-disciplined technicians who can be flexible in their skill set. Job security, placement and promotion were also areas continuously cited as potential benefits of a diverse workforce with some background and knowledge in green and sustainable practices. These findings are consistent with the 2010 Report of the National Energy Technician Education Summit which noted that colleges should seek to integrate sustainable energy competencies in existing programs. For this reason, the college is adapting existing programs to meet the emerging needs for green enabled students across technical disciplines. Working with industry partners to map their specific and cross disciplinary needs, the college is also developing a technical certificate that demonstrates a wide range of cross cutting technical skills and competencies. In addition, the National Energy Technician Education Summit noted the need to develop life long career and educational pathways for technicians to support the changing workplace, including improving articulation between programs at the secondary schools and two-year colleges. To address this recommendation the college is developing an education pipeline by providing hands on, experiential and problem-based learning opportunities for middle school students and dual credit enrollment opportunities for high school students interested in pursuing a career in a technical field with a cross disciplinary focus in sustainable energy. The project has the additional impact of reaching low-income and minority students in partnering middle schools and piloting the certificate program through dual credit enrollment in a high school district located in rural Grundy County.<br/><br/>This project is integrating sustainable energy principles and practices across technical disciplines while improving and increasing student learning in topical areas related to science and engineering technology since many subject areas in the broad topic of sustainable energy technology are scientific principles and are strongly based on physical sciences such as physics, chemistry and earth science. The project design incorporates successful models for curriculum development and integration of sustainability theory and practices, professional development based on the Madison Area Technical College Career Education in Renewable Energy Technologies (CERET) Train the Trainer model, and highly contextualized STEM learning through experiential and problem based learning opportunities. The goals and objectives of the project have measurable outcomes, and evaluation is assessing the impact of enrollment in courses, seminars, workshops, experiential learning opportunities and dual credit enrollment courses as well as increased knowledge and interest in sustainability, attainment of core competencies, retention, and subsequent completion."

In physics, a growing community of physics education researchers has documented deficits in student understanding in a variety of physics topics. The results of this research have been applied to the development of curricula that are measurably effective at improving student understanding. However, many of these curricular modifications require that busy faculty members make substantial and major changes to instruction. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop materials intended to enhance conceptual understanding of basic mechanics in introductory physics courses. The project is creating a large collection of easy-to-administer, ready-to-use, classroom and student-tested materials in basic mechanics (linear and rotational kinematics, linear and rotational dynamics, statics, momentum and impulse, work and energy, and periodic motion) that can be used as classroom materials, as out-of-class assignments, or as alternative assessments. These TIPERs (Tasks Inspired by Physics Education Research), such as Ranking Tasks and Working Backwards Tasks, are easily incorporated into existing courses and teaching styles. They may be used as individual exercises so that instructors who are interested in improving instruction can modify their courses in an incremental manner. An additional feature is the development of classroom polling questions to be used either with wireless polling devices ('clickers') or with low-cost, low tech, hand-held student polling cards. The materials are being tested at several institutions and made widely available in both print and electronic versions. <br/><br/>Intellectual merit: This project provides a model pathway to the adoption of research-based curricula. In all STEM disciplines, some departments will be able to plunge into wholesale adoption of new curricula. However, it is important to provide a means for individual faculty who are not in such departments to incorporate the results of education research into their classrooms through use of materials that promote conceptual understanding and thus improve learning. The nTIPERs (mechanics TIPERs based primarily on Newtonian physics) materials are based on physics education research and foster improved conceptual understanding of important topics. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: This effort is a collaboration between two-year college and university physics faculty from institutions that have diverse student populations. Since mechanics is the cornerstone of almost all introductory physics courses, these materials are applicable to secondary, two-year college, and college/university courses throughout the country. By facilitating the adoption of research-based educational materials, this project is helping to improve the level of scientific understanding of the fundamental concepts, principles, and relations of mechanics that are critical to a robust understanding of the physical world."
