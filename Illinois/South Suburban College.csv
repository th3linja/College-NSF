Laboratory experiences will be emphasized which utilize the requested equipment to bridge theoretical concepts with practical applications. A useful by-product will be student exposure to computer data bases as well as an improved understanding of the FT function. . A greater success in transfer student's adaptability to the four-year college laboratory experience is a major objective of the improvements. In addition, district science teachers will benefit from hands-on experiences in SSC sponsored workshops."
