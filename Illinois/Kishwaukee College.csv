Studies of this wetland ecosystem, therefore, are determining population densities and are providing data on diversity. We have recently added a course in field biology to our curriculum and students in this course also participate directly in the research. Videotapes describing the life of the wetland are also being produced for use by the community. It is expected that the project will provide additional education opportunities such as cooperative learning and independent study."
