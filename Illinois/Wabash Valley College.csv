Faculty from the College's Electronics and Diesel Hydraulics programs are developing a new inter- departmental course that focuses on a team approach to problem solving, using the multimedia laboratory to simulate the principles and functions of robotics, hydraulics, and programmable controllers in today's workplace. Computerized interactive video tapes are being developed to supplement the instruction. Interactive media allows the student to see and manipulate key equipment and the processes used in a manufacturing environment. The multimedia laboratory is to be shared with other departments in the Applied Sciences field and with area high schools."
