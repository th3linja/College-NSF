The PI for this project is Thomas Higgins, who will be assisted by Co-PIs Thomas Dowd, Gregory Ference, Yvonne Harris and Roger House. The collaborating partners in this project include: The seven campuses of the City Colleges of Chicago (Harold Washington College is the lead institution); William Rainey Harper College; Oakton Community College; and College of DuPage. Other partners are: Illinois State University, Youngstown State University, Chicago State University, and Hope College. Informal agreements to host summer students and/or build faculty collaborations have been made with DePaul University, Loyola University of Chicago, Northern Illinois University, the University of Illinois at Chicago, and Case Western Reserve University. The DuPont-Northwestern-Dow Collaborative Access Team at the Advance Photon Source and the Chemical Engineering Division, both located at Argonne National Laboratory, are also working with the Collaborative. The goals of this project are to: (1) Identify and recruit promising young scientists from two-year colleges (2YCs) into the STEM disciplines, especially, from traditionally under-represented groups; (2) Train 2YC students to become effective practitioners of science; (3) Instill in 2YC students the confidence to pursue science as a profession; (4) Encourage 2YC students to complete their undergraduate and graduate STEM education; and (5) Transform the cultures of participating 2YCs by embedding intensive research experiences during the academic year and summer into their curricula and their courses. These institutions are located in the Chicago-metro area and collectively serve approximately 106,000 undergraduates annually, 42% of whom come from underrepresented groups. In City Colleges of Chicago, 70% of the 50,000 undergraduates are either Black or Hispanic."

This project aims to award 94 scholarships over five years to 47 unique STEM students as they progress through academic requirements for an associate degree and transfer to a four-year institution for a baccalaureate degree in a STEM major. Because urban community colleges are the entry point to higher education for many low income and demographic groups that are underrepresented in STEM careers, by increasing the success and transfer rates of these students and identifying practices that most impact and promote student persistence, this project can provide a model for other community colleges. <br/><br/>The project will take a cultural wealth approach, which focuses on how cultural capital can be nurtured to promote student success. This approach results in a shift in focus from a deficit model, which assumes students are working from a position of disadvantage, to a position that students possess unacknowledged and unrecognized cultural knowledge that enhances their learning. The project will engage students in student-driven creative exploration and project-based learning, scaffolded by formal mentoring and skills-focused instruction. This project will involve cohort building, networking, and faculty development activities. Cohort activities include a common course sequence. Networking activities include professional development, social, and community engagement events for all students and will be co-organized by the S-STEM Scholars and existing the HWC STEM Club. Faculty development will focus on the creation of a professional learning community. An extensive research study is planned to help determine how to redesign classroom activities, courses, and curricula to maximize the success of students, and the cultural wealth focus will provide insights into how community college systems can change to meet the expectations and needs of their students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a collaborative project between William Rainey Harper College (WRHC) and Harold Washington College (HWC). Thomas Dowd (WRHC) and Thomas Higgins (HWC) are the PIs for this project, and Co-PIs Roger House (WRHC) and Daniel Stanford (WRHC) assist them. The specific goals of this project are: (1) to provide 12 2YC undergraduates with authentic, on-campus, academic-year research experiences mentored by 2YC faculty. Six students will participate each project year; (2) to assess the impact of the research experience on students' attitudes, skills and likelihood of future study and employment in STEM fields; (3) to provide professional development opportunities for 2YC faculty by giving them the opportunity and resources to re-connect with their disciplinary research interests, and; (4) to build a network of local and regional 4YCs that will collaborate with 2YC faculty and can provide 2YC students with summer research experiences. WRHC is a comprehensive 2YC located in Palatine, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, Illinois with an annual enrollment of over 25,000 students (4,000 full-time and 21,000 part-time). Almost 3,000 students enroll in science classes each semester with 41% of the student population coming from traditionally underrepresented groups (58% female; 17% Hispanic, 14% Asian/Pacific Islander, 3% Black, and 7% other). HWC is a one of the City Colleges of Chicago and is a Minority Serving Institution with an annual enrollment of over 11,000 students (5,000 full-time and 6,000 part-time). Over 500 students enroll in science classes each semester with 62% of the student population coming from traditionally underrepresented groups (57% female; 44% Black, 18% Hispanic, 12% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 3% other). Because of the diversity of both institutions, it is highly likely that a significant number of the students involved in the project will be from under-represented groups.<br/>"

The project is implementing POGIL materials in at least 13 chemistry courses, directly affecting up to 400 community college students at the two colleges. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit and broader impact of this project is based on the prior success of POGIL at a variety of undergraduate institutions. POGIL has been demonstrated to improve students' ability to understand scientific content, and also students' ability to practice scientific methods. The learning and attitudinal gains POGIL students have experienced are similar to gains experienced by students with an authentic undergraduate research experience, and this project may prove to be an effective way of recruiting and retaining community college students into STEM majors and, ultimately, STEM careers. Groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences make up a majority of the HWC student population (44% Black, 18% Hispanic), as well as a significant portion of the HC student population (17% Hispanic, 3% Black), increasing the broader impact of this project. <br/><br/>Because of this project, participating faculty are becoming qualified to address issues relating to successful POGIL dissemination, adaptation, implementation, and assessment at community colleges and with underrepresented student groups. This expertise is being shared through presentations at local and regional professional conferences, as well as being published in the relevant literature and presented at national meetings. In addition, this project is augmenting the current national POGIL Project assessment and dissemination effort by providing a significant amount of assessment data relating to two-year, minority-serving institutions and their student bodies.<br/>"

However, due to its short average lifetime (2.2 microseconds), it has not been possible to accelerate a muon beam. A key step in demonstrating the feasibility of muon accelerators is the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE).  The main obstacle to accelerating an intense muon beam is that the way such beams are created makes them too large to fit into the vacuum chamber of a synchrotron, and the short muon lifetime leaves little time to shrink the beam. Ionization cooling is a new technique to shrink, or cool a muon beam quickly.  The goal of MICE is to build a section of an ionization-cooling channel, instrument it to measure its cooling performance, and use a muon beam produced at a particle accelerator to demonstrate that it works as designed.  A collaborative effort of some 150 physicists and engineers from Europe, Asia, and the US, MICE is being mounted at England's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.  Construction of the apparatus is currently in progress, and the running of the experiment and analysis of its results is expected to take place during the 3-year period of the grant proposed here.  This proposal requests renewal funding for the Illinois Institute of Technology MICE group in support of continued US leadership in muon cooling and in the muon accelerator facilities that might be constructed, in the US or elsewhere, once the feasibility of ionization cooling is demonstrated.  The broader impact of this work is most evident in the use of an accelerated muon beam for a Neutrino Factory recognized as the most powerful tool yet conceived in the quest to understand the mysterious oscillatory behavior of the neutrino and its possible role in the evolution of the matter-dominated Universe in which we live.  In addition, the pace of MICE development, running, and analysis is particularly well suited to the training of students.  MICE will take approximately three years to complete, a good fit to the typical physics student?s graduate training."
