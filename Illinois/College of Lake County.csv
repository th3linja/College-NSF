"1205034","The College of Lake County Regional Photonics Initiative Phase II","DUE","ADVANCED TECH EDUCATION PROG","10/01/2012","09/21/2012","Steven Dulmes","IL","College of Lake County","Standard Grant","Virginia Carter","09/30/2016","$897,054.00","Lynn Wiechert","sldulmes@wi.rr.com","19351 W Washington Street","Grayslake","IL","600301148","8475432476","EHR","7412","1032, 9178, SMET","$0.00","PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS:<br/>Lake County High Schools Technical Campus (LCHSTC)<br/>Indian Hills Community College in Iowa<br/>National Center for Optics and Photonics Education (OP-TEC)<br/> <br/><br/>PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br/>The College of Lake County (CLC) is developing a regional Photonics program for a Laser/Optics/Photonics Associates degree in Applied Science (AAS). The program offers innovative instruction, delivery and scheduling; relying on a modular curriculum that is delivered through a hybrid, early entry/early exit system to reduce the time a student needs to complete a degree. It seeks to solve the problem of student recruitment into technical workforce education by creating a new pipeline of students from Lake County High Schools Technical Campus, which is located on the college campus. Students are able to complete a Photonics Certificate at their high school in two years (obtaining full college credit), also having a career pathway built into the AAS degree at CLC. <br/><br/>This initiative first provides students with a hands-on experience with Class 1, 2 and 3 lasers until they are able to operate them in a safe environment. Students are then trained on class 3b and 4 powered lasers for applications such as interferometry, holography, and spectroscopy, and finally on high powered lasers used in the military and manufacturing applications. They are exposed to lasers using different lasing media and are provided with opportunities to explore biomedical applications to understand the context of laser utilization. The effort is creating an integrated pipeline from technical high school to community college and from community college to four-year institutions, all with emphasis on completion of degrees and certificates achieved through unconventional and innovative delivery methods. In addition, the project is examining the possibility of creating an AB degree with 4-year transfer institutions that support such an option.<br/><br/><br/>BROADER SIGNIFICANCE<br/>This project takes advantage of the co-location of a technical high school and a community college to add value to both, creating a pathway to high-wage, high growth technical jobs for high school and community college students. The CLC Photonics Initiative provides a pathway to available jobs in the area hardest hit by the economic downturn by offering an innovative approach to STEM education. The project offers broad applicability for the nation and Midwest, particularly in preparing students for Photonics careers. The team is creating a Regional Photonics Program in collaboration with Indian Hills Community College and OP-TEC. CLC is also part of OP-TEC's Photonics College Network, which can obtain community equipment that would be difficult for one school to purchase alone - offering students access to state-of-the-art equipment (e.g., a fiber laser and articulating robot). The program offers a model that can be replicated elsewhere, further providing widespread access to high-tech education and training."

Scholars are being organized into cohorts, which are subsequently supported by activities such as individualized advisement, structured tutorials, mentoring, and a summer orientation.<br/><br/>The College of Lake County (CLC) S-STEM scholar program provides a model for increasing the recruitment and retention rate of students underrepresented in these STEM disciplines.  Once fully established and evaluated, many of the mentoring and student support strategies used in this project can be implemented and continued with nominal cost to an institution.  With institutions like CLC accounting for almost half of the nation's STEM undergraduates and over half of all minorities in higher education, the project offers the opportunity for broad impact on the STEM pipeline."

The project will support students at the College of Lake County, which is a community college as well as a Hispanic Serving Institution. Over its five-year duration, this project will provide up to three-year scholarships to 125 students who are pursuing associate of science degrees and who intend to transfer and complete a bachelor's degree in engineering or computer science. Five additional university-level scholarships per year will be awarded to students as they transfer. The project aims to increase student persistence by linking scholarships with effective support activities, including academic advising programs, tutoring and study sessions, makerspace activities, internships, and enrolling Scholars as cohorts in special sections of Calculus, Engineering Graphics, and Introduction to Engineering courses. Central to these activities is the introduction of the Baxter Innovation Lab (Makerspace/Fab Lab) as the engineering and computer science cultural hub.  Because the College of Lake County has a high population of underrepresented students, this project has the potential to broaden participation in the engineering and computer science fields.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. There are two specific aims: 1) study the effectiveness of enhanced community building at the College of Lake County; and 2) explore the impact of experiential learning and internships by examining how both affect self-efficacy and sense of belonging. Considerable research has been conducted about self-efficacy and student success.  However, little data are available about how a makerspace environment and/or a community college context affect self-efficacy and student success. This project has the potential to help fill some of these research gaps. The project will conduct educational assessment and program evaluation to identify key interventions that promote student success and to provide information that can be used to improve STEM education at other institutions. Results from this work will be broadly disseminated to a variety of audiences through digital outlets, presentations at national conferences, and publications in peer-reviewed and trade journals. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will design and develop low-cost laboratory trainers and offer professional development opportunities for high school faculty to adopt components of the curriculum at their respective high schools. The curriculum will be aligned to specific skills needed in the industry and shared and disseminated to high schools and colleges across the nation. <br/><br/>The new Associate's degree is laddered from a one-year Mechatronics certificate that was created from a Department of Labor TAACCCT (Round I) grant project that included the partnering entities.  The curriculum will be based on constructivist learning theory incorporating inductive, project based instruction.  It will be modularized for flexible delivery and focused on system level troubleshooting.  In addition, low-cost, hands-on, easily replicable and buildable mechatronics trainers will provide the local high schools with an affordable tool to teach the courses.  During the faculty professional development aspect of the project, CollaborATE will focus on the integration of the low-cost trainers with systems-level, inductive teaching methodology. To prepare students for high-skilled, high-wage, entry level positions in the mechatronics industry, the Florida Advanced Technological Center will provide expertise to align the degree content with national and international certifications such as those from Siemens Level 2, the Packaging Machinery Manufacturers Institute, and the National Institute for Metalworking Skills."

This area witnessed the incipient development of social complexity and multiple sites in the region are characterized by conspicuous monumentality (e.g. stone spheres, large earthen mounds). Previous scholarship concentrated largely upon interpretations of artwork, and it is not yet clear which economic or political factors contributed to social changes over time. Such questions are important to pursue because the various pathways to social hierarchy are not completely understood. As these social changes lie in the prehistoric past, archaeology is one of the few avenues capable of studying this topic in detail. By taking a long term approach it is possible to gain insight into the factors which hold small scale societies together an allow them to function as effective stable units. The problem of social stability - or lack thereof - is an important source of dissention in the world today and thus the research is of practical contemporary relevance.<br/><br/>Several researchers previously argued that control over the best agricultural land was important to political authorities; others argued that social factors were the primary determinant of settlement distribution. The Bolas region represents an ideal location to investigate these possibilities because it is environmentally heterogeneous and because previous research documented variations in the intensity of craft production between settlements. Dr. Palumbo and his research team will investigate these possibilities through regional survey of Bolas and its immediate hinterland. The survey will involve digging thousands of small excavation units and collecting artifacts (e.g. stone chips, broken pottery) from domestic trash contexts from dozens of sites. This trash will be compared and contrasted to examine differences in social status and variation in past production activities. This study may demonstrate that the evidence for high social rank was closely associated with the best agricultural land over time, thus suggesting this one environmental variable assumed an important role in development of hierarchy. Another possible result is that high ranking households were weakly associated with the best soils, but instead practiced other activities (e.g. hosting feasts, producing crafts), suggesting a political economy based on different principles. Ultimately, this research will be used to compare the Bolas region to other regions in the world to better understand how social complexity developed and persisted in the past. The team will generate important data and strengthen scholarly collaborations between colleagues in the United States and Costa Rica, as well as create and enhance educational opportunities for students and local communities."
