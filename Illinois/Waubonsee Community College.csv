Disciplines include Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Engineering Science, Physics, Mathematics, and Geosciences (Earth Science/ Geology/ Oceanography/ Astronomy/ Meteorology/ Geography).  The multi-disciplinary team of faculty is strong, and there are extensive support structures for the students. The target is 95% graduation and/or transfer rate among STEM Scholars. <br/><br/>Broader Impact:  The project is implementing a pro-active recruiting program with area high school STEM faculty and administrators to encourage students toward STEM careers. Students are recruited from the 22 high schools served by the college, and from among current students. New and returning STEM Scholars each year form a cohort/learning community nurtured by faculty mentors, counselors and the PI. Selection criteria include high grades in high school STEM courses, high overall GPA, recommendations from faculty and personal essays. STEM scholars have bi-weekly meetings with faculty mentors, group enrollment in some courses, participation in group study and field trips, and meetings with visiting speakers from education and industry. Career/transfer counseling is provided throughout the program."

Increased enrollments have stretched the college's ability to provide students with hands-on use of technology. The purchase of Calculator-Based Laboratory (CBL) Systems will enable us to offer educational experiences to students which improve instruction by using inexpensive, durable, modern equipment. Objectives: Improve the scientific competencies of students to monitor, record and analyze biological data. Methods: Each CBL System will allow an average class of 28 students to work in groups of two students per station. Students will perform a multitude of hands-on experiences in 1) Ecology, 2) Environmental Biology, and 3) Physiology. Audience: Twelve hundred students enrolled in undergraduate biology courses at Waubonsee Community College. Additional students enrolled in distance learning courses at community colleges in northern Illinois. Collaborations: None in project year. Fox Valley Education Alliance which includes five community college districts after the first project year. Significance of Impact on Undergraduate Education: The project offers hands-on laboratory experiences using inexpensive modern technology and equipment and would serve as a model to extend biology laboratory instruction via distance learning networks both regionally and nationally."
