The project includes high school outreach, curriculum reform, mentoring, and other extracurricular activities. It is a collaborative project between the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Illinois State University, Heartland Community College, Parkland College, Bradley University, and Eastern Illinois University. The project involves building communities among various groups within the state to recruit, support, and retain students in computing courses and programs.<br/> <br/>The intellectual merit of this project lies in the strong research basis for the intervention models as well as the vertical integration of the models at a range of secondary and post-secondary institutions within the state. The project plan is clear and reasonable with well-defined roles for the partners. The project builds on existing programs and partnerships within the state and includes investigators with significant relevant experience.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project lie with the potential increasing the participation of under-represented groups in computer science within one state. If successful, the project may provide a sound model for similar broad-based approaches in other states and geographical areas.    <br/><br/>"

The adaptation of POGIL and biodiesel for teaching non-STEM majors is original and unique. Moreover, this project is innovative in its use of ""en masse interactive laboratories"" for large-enrollment courses and its application of POGIL to environmental science courses.  The POGIL modules are being used to enhance the student's knowledge, science literacy, inquiry and appreciation of science for students in non-science majors chemistry courses and environmental science courses taught at each institution.  An additional intellectual merit is that this collaboration is advancing knowledge and understanding in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education of non-STEM students. There are two primary broader impacts of the new POGIL modules.  First, biodiesel production and utilization is an excellent avenue for introducing scientific principles and enhancing the scientific literacy for students not intending to major in science because students find the biodiesel thematic topic engaging and the POGIL pedagogy is sustaining that engagement.  Second, this project is providing valuable information on how to implement POGIL modules at three institutions with very divergent student profiles."

It consists of three activities: 1. An introductory biology course for science majors which fully incorporate micro-computer and CD-ROM technology. 2. Addition of a micro-computer based laboratory to Contemporary Biology, the current lecture only course for non-majors. 3. Development of a resource manual of laboratory activities used by all the biology faculty. The resource manual is organized into modules based on the framework of unifying principles as outlined by BSCS and reflects reforms recommended by AAAS in Project 2061. Each module includes activities appropriate for varying levels of student backgrounds and interest."
