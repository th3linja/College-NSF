The laboratory, located in college library, is being used to support the three entry-level biology courses. The target population includes first-generation college students who are underprepared, nontraditional students and non-majors who plan to become elementary or high school teachers. The curriculum for the entry-level courses is being enhanced through increased emphasis on problem-solving experiments, conducted by students in the Open Laboratory."

The proposal originates from the Biology Department at Illinois Eastern Community Colleges, a two-year, publicly-supported college in southeastern Illinois. The students served by IECC and the Biology Department are largely from rural areas, having attended high schools where science programs are limited by a lack of funds and instructional resources. Since class sizes are often very small, many local high schools are often hardpressed to provide fulltime science faculty. As a result, the community college system provides the first opportunity many rural students have to become familiarized with investigative science and more sophisticated scientific tools & methods. The proposed laboratory improvement project is designed to change students' perception of science as simply a succession of ""cookbook experiments"" and allow them to explore, in depth, a key scientific issue - the significance of phytoplankton (commonly referred to as algae), in the ecosystem. The addition of a modern culture incubator system in the college's laboratory will provide the vehicle for supporting this investigative approach to undergraduate science."

One of the great resources of Southern Illinois (and all of the Midwest) is the abundance of water. This project targets these resources by focusing student experiences on the microorganisms of aquatic ecosystems. Initial work on this project began during the summer of 1987 with the addition of two new courses: Field Biology, and Research in Biological Science. This curriculum addition, combined with new equipment purchases, represents the faculty's determination and commitment to link the classroom with the world of living organisms. To support this project the NSF award has financed the purchase of a quality microscope with phase contrast, epifluorescence and photomicrographic accessories, as well as a small utility boat with equipment for sampling lake and reservoir sediments. With these equipment additions, the aquatic microbiology students are being given an opportunity to combine the excitement and motivation of field work with experience in conducting sound scientific inquiry. Students enrolled in these courses are largely those in the college's four-year transfer program who look forward to completing the baccalaureate in a science-related field. Through reports by these students often presented to local high school classes and to community adult groups, the project also contributes to better public understanding of science and to increased pre-college student interest in science careers. The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources."

New and older computers can be utilized through new interfacing techniques that transform obsolete computers into versatile laboratory equipment. The goals of the project are to increase student access to new research methods by (1) updating the calculus-based sequences of courses for engineering, physics, and mathematics majors with new problem-solving experiments, using microcomputer-based equipment, (2) providing more exciting and enlightening experiments for the liberal arts students in Survey of Physics, using the MBL; and (3) disseminating advances in computer-based experimental methods to the science and math teachers in rural high schools throughout the region."
