The project is:  (a) coordinating the chemistry curricula of secondary schools, community colleges and universities in Chicago, (b) recruiting students from the secondary and community college level into the program, (c) providing chemical technology enhancement opportunities for secondary school teachers and community college faculty, (d) developing curriculum for advanced Chemical Laboratory Technology education, in particular a course in instrumental analysis, and (e) integrating the program with Chicago area industries and professional societies. This project is creating an urban model for advanced technology programs, addressing both the unique problems of inner city students, and their preparation for entry into high tech careers."

This instrument, a Fourier transform                   infrared spectrometer (FT-IR), gives the students a powerful tool               to enhance their skills when using microscale organic chemistry                 laboratory experiments.  The FT-IR allows fast, accurate                        identification of organic compounds when enhanced with computer                 interfaced data acquisition and interpretation capabilities.  Use               of this instrumentation enables our student population to acquire               the laboratory skills necessary to compete successfully when they               transfer to baccalaureate programs or seek professional                         employment.
