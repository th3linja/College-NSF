The laboratory centered approach to teaching chemistry and physics is intended to attract students who have avoided traditional science instruction and to retain students who would otherwise be turned off by such instruction by making learning individualized, interactive, participatory, exploratory and visual. This approach has been tested and proven to improve the learning, retention, and application of physics and chemistry principles by promoting conceptual understanding and relating the laboratory experience to the real world. At each workstation the student determines strategies for solving a problem, chooses the initial conditions and predicts the result of the experiment, and the microcomputer will perform data collection, analysis, and graphing functions and/or perform simulations of real experiments through interactive software and videodisc technology. Because this approach is more efficient, students are motivated to learn more by trial and error probing. ***"
