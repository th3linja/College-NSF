A new organic lab has been built. New instruments have been purchased including two infrared spectrometers, a UV-visible spectrophotometer and five computers. The acquisition, through this project, of a NMR spectrometer was the next logical step in the modernization program. NMR spectroscopy had been taught entirely as a classroom subject at the college. Direct laboratory experience with the NMR added a new dimension to learning this difficult subject, making it vivid and real. Since most four-year colleges and universities provide laboratory experiments in NMR for sophomore organic students, having the NMR spectrometer provides the sophomores with an educational experience equivalent to that of sophomores at other schools. The plan for using the NMR has three parts. At the end of the first semester organic course, students are introduced to the instrument via a demonstration, computer simulation, supervised practice and, finally recording the spectrum of an unknown. During the second semester students use NMR spectroscopy to characterize the products of synthetic reactions. Finally, at the end of the second semester, students use NMR in doing qualitative organic analysis. The institution has contributed to this project in an amount equal to the NSF funds."

This is a collaborative project between William Rainey Harper College (WRHC) and Harold Washington College (HWC). Thomas Dowd (WRHC) and Thomas Higgins (HWC) are the PIs for this project, and Co-PIs Roger House (WRHC) and Daniel Stanford (WRHC) assist them. The specific goals of this project are: (1) to provide 12 2YC undergraduates with authentic, on-campus, academic-year research experiences mentored by 2YC faculty. Six students will participate each project year; (2) to assess the impact of the research experience on students' attitudes, skills and likelihood of future study and employment in STEM fields; (3) to provide professional development opportunities for 2YC faculty by giving them the opportunity and resources to re-connect with their disciplinary research interests, and; (4) to build a network of local and regional 4YCs that will collaborate with 2YC faculty and can provide 2YC students with summer research experiences. WRHC is a comprehensive 2YC located in Palatine, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, Illinois with an annual enrollment of over 25,000 students (4,000 full-time and 21,000 part-time). Almost 3,000 students enroll in science classes each semester with 41% of the student population coming from traditionally underrepresented groups (58% female; 17% Hispanic, 14% Asian/Pacific Islander, 3% Black, and 7% other). HWC is a one of the City Colleges of Chicago and is a Minority Serving Institution with an annual enrollment of over 11,000 students (5,000 full-time and 6,000 part-time). Over 500 students enroll in science classes each semester with 62% of the student population coming from traditionally underrepresented groups (57% female; 44% Black, 18% Hispanic, 12% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 3% other). Because of the diversity of both institutions, it is highly likely that a significant number of the students involved in the project will be from under-represented groups."

The CPLP is an initiative supported by the NSF-DUE Course and Curriculum Development Program. The CPLP materials under development focus on providing students with experiments using scenarios drawn from seven different departments in four different colleges within the University of Illinois at Chicago. An important instrumentation need has been identified by the network participants to support the best implementation of the CPLP concept: the use of rapid and reliable diode array instrumentation (UV-Visible) for many of the experiments. This instrumentation, whose purchase or upgrade is the focus of this proposal, is needed to make the student experience of general chemistry concepts, in a professional context, as effective as possible. In addition to the interdisciplinary nature of the materials developed, the CPLP has a strong faculty development focus. Community college faculty worked extensively during the dissemination program learning the methodology and pedagogy of these labs. It is anticipated that this program will, have a positive impact on teaching and learning chemistry as well as provide a more effective laboratory experience."

Retention is of paramount concern at two-year colleges (2YC) where many students enroll in chemistry classes to only satisfy job or degree requirements, then drop or discontinue taking science courses.  The PIs are studying the effect of earlier exposure to an important technology, specifically Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FTNMR), on student perception of and attitudes toward science research. The proposed curriculum and laboratory improvement and its concurrent evaluations are contributing to the understanding of the impact of laboratory instruction on 2YC student attitudes toward and success in chemistry, an area of study that is almost untreated in the literature. The Harper College Chemistry Department has a diverse student body with significant populations of underrepresented groups. The PIs are studying the effect of this type of experience in attracting those groups toward the sciences and its effect on the success of transfer students into 4-year programs.  <br/>"

In addition, the project leaders are engaging in dissemination activities to determine the effects of implementation of these materials. The curriculum materials are designed to provide students with greater mathematical literacy and a stronger foundation to bridge the gap to calculus. The project is investigating the adaptability of current calculus reform dissemination models for use in an algebra reform curriculum. They are also designing a model for evaluation of student attitudes and performance in comparison with students taking introductory and/or intermediate algebra in a traditional setting, as well as an instrument to document pedagogical changes in teachers trying to implement a non-traditional curriculum. A proposed outcome of the project is a model for implementing a reform algebra curriculum and the establishment of a network of two-year and four-year college developmental mathematics implementers for a particular curriculum reform project. ***y"

A new organic lab has been built. The chemistry storage area, preproom, balance room, and instrumentation room have all been remodeled and updated. New instruments have been purchased including two infrared spectrometers, an ultra-violet-visible spectrophotometer, two high pressure liquid chromatographs, and a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. Acquiring a new atomic absorption (AA) spectrometer is the next logical step in this modernization program. It is the perfect addition to the department's array of state-of-the-art equipment. Recent chemical education literature has stressed the need to improve student interest and success in general chemistry courses. One way to do this is through active participation in laboratory experiments that have an obvious relevance to everyday life. Direct, hands-on experience with AA can spark interest in learning science while teaching basic instrumentation and research skills to undergraduate chemistry students. The plan to use AA spectroscopy involves its immediate implementation in the laboratory component of three freshman-level chemistry courses."
