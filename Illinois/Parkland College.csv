A wide range of careers, from precision agriculture and crop insurance to real estate and police work, need trained UAS technicians. In addition, industries are discovering new needs for UAS and industries that use UAS are finding new ways to benefit from the data and imagery gathered by UAS. To meet these increasing demands, Parkland College will develop UAS courses and certificates with a focus on agricultural applications. This project will include the participation of five other community colleges, three four-year institutions, and industry partners. The new curriculum will advance UAS technician education so that students earn relevant credentials that will prepare them for jobs after completion. The project will focus on recruiting women and veterans into the UAS program, and will engage high schools and universities to enhance educational avenues into UAS technology careers. Students who graduate with credentials in UAS technologies should be able to enter a high-growth STEM industry that is expected to need many workers in the next decade. <br/><br/>The central goal of the project is to develop UAS curricula at Parkland College that meet industry needs in the major agricultural hub of Central Illinois and its surrounding area, which is expanding the use of UAS technologies. The newly-developed courses will be based on existing courses from partnering community colleges but with an emphasis on UAS applications for agricultural industries. Topics covered in the courses will include flight controllers, aerodynamics, managing data, regulations, and safety and operational considerations. The courses will be combined to create 6-credit and 18-credit UAS certificates. Industry input about curricular content will be integrated into designing the credentials so that the credentials appropriately prepare technicians for jobs in the UAS sector. The project team also aims to develop articulation agreements with universities offering UAS degrees. These connections will ensure that the new curriculum will be transferable for students wishing to continue their education. Project outreach activities will focus on recruiting women and veterans into the program, and foster associations with regional high schools. The products and best practices from the project will be disseminated through coordination with community college and university partners as well as online at multiple NSF-ATE Centers, including the National Geospatial Technology Center of Excellence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They work with soil testing companies, crop consulting firms, and fertilizer and chemical retailers, but the shortage of precision agriculture educational opportunities limits the ability of businesses to hire qualified employees and forces them to use their limited resources on incumbent worker training. In addition, the gap between industry need and existing training leads to graduates having to retrain or take additional courses even though they have already earned a general agriculture degree. By offering an enhanced curriculum to high school and college students, this project at Parkland College in Illinois will educate a wide variety of agriculture workers in line with industry needs as it provides a robust education and training program to support the vital agricultural industry of Illinois and the United States. A focus of the project is on increasing the number of women in precision agriculture, which will strengthen and diversify an emerging American industry. The deliverables and best practices developed through the project will be disseminated through coordination with the ATE National Geospatial Technology Center of Excellence, Clark State Community College in Springfield, OH, and agricultural education conferences.<br/><br/>Jobs in precision agriculture require a unique combination of technical and agricultural expertise that is not widely available for high school and college students. Due to the highly technical nature of precision agriculture jobs, the curriculum in the field is often outdated and does not fully prepare students for available positions. Enhancing precision agriculture curriculum for two-year colleges and connecting this curriculum with high schools and four-year colleges will dramatically improve the preparedness of technicians in a number of agricultural sectors. It will utilize the existing precision agriculture curriculum as the foundation for an enhanced program including a more comprehensive associate degree, updated articulation agreements, and the development of dual-enrollment content for area high schools. These components will create a 2+2+2 structure that will be replicable in other regions and sustainable. The project will utilize emerging technologies in conjunction with agronomy to enhance precision agriculture education and will be developed in close partnership with local and regional employers. A formative and summative evaluation process will be employed to continuously enhance the project activities and provide opportunities for researching and evaluating the success of the project and deliverables."
