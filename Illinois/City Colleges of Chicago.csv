Projects supported by the HSI program will also generate new knowledge about how to achieve these aims.  This project at Wilbur Wright College will advance the aims of the HSI Program by enabling talented, underprepared, low-income students to pursue and complete a bachelor's degree in engineering or computer science.  Public schools in urban areas struggle to prepare their large populations of low-income students in math and science. Thus, many high school graduates are not well prepared to pursue further education requiring quantitative or analytical thinking, or to join the US workforce in jobs demanding these skills. This project aims to develop and implement pathways, practices, and interventions to support student success in engineering or computer science at two critical transitions: from high school to community college, and from community college to four-year universities.  The project plans to achieve this goal partly through streamlined connections between Wilbur Wright College, the Chicago Public schools, and public four-year colleges and universities in Illinois.  The strategies developed and the knowledge produced in this project are expected to be significant to a broad segment of public education.<br/><br/>The project will be centered at Wilbur Wright College, an urban community college in the City Colleges of Chicago system.  Wilbur Wright College is the largest federally recognized Hispanic-serving community college in Illinois. The project aims to build bridges across critical transitions by creating a Summer Bridge Camp to improve math skills and prepare incoming students for an engineering or computer science curriculum. It will also create a one-year engineering Gateway course to further strengthen students' math skills and self-efficacy.  The project also aims to enhance practices that support the development of students' professional identity (i.e. the ability to see themselves as engineers or computer scientists), through faculty and near-peer mentoring, tutoring, intentional advising, engineering and computer science social events, and participation in professional meetings. The project will track students' semester-to-semester GPA, retention, transfer, graduation rates, and length of time to complete the associate's and bachelor's degrees. Self-efficacy and identity will be measured by an educational research professional.  This project is expected to contribute to the national need for a diverse engineering and computer science workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thomas Dowd (WRHC) and Thomas Higgins (HWC) are the PIs for this project, and Co-PIs Roger House (WRHC) and Daniel Stanford (WRHC) assist them. The specific goals of this project are: (1) to provide 12 2YC undergraduates with authentic, on-campus, academic-year research experiences mentored by 2YC faculty. Six students will participate each project year; (2) to assess the impact of the research experience on students' attitudes, skills and likelihood of future study and employment in STEM fields; (3) to provide professional development opportunities for 2YC faculty by giving them the opportunity and resources to re-connect with their disciplinary research interests, and; (4) to build a network of local and regional 4YCs that will collaborate with 2YC faculty and can provide 2YC students with summer research experiences. WRHC is a comprehensive 2YC located in Palatine, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, Illinois with an annual enrollment of over 25,000 students (4,000 full-time and 21,000 part-time). Almost 3,000 students enroll in science classes each semester with 41% of the student population coming from traditionally underrepresented groups (58% female; 17% Hispanic, 14% Asian/Pacific Islander, 3% Black, and 7% other). HWC is a one of the City Colleges of Chicago and is a Minority Serving Institution with an annual enrollment of over 11,000 students (5,000 full-time and 6,000 part-time).

Each year for three summers, four undergraduates and one faculty will travel to Kenya to conduct field research in Arabuko-Sokoke Forest. Arabuko-Sokoke Forest in coastal Kenya ranks second as the most important forest for bird conservation in mainland Africa. The 270 bird species known from it include six globally threatened, three near-threatened species, eight species categorized as regionally threatened in eastern Africa and several other forest-specialist birds. Both threatened and forest specialist birds show preference for certain habitat types. However, Arabuko-Sokoke Forest is under severe pressure due to selective logging, pole harvesting for building, fuel wood collection and unplanned tourism activities. These activities have different impacts on the forest and have the potentials of altering the forest structure and negatively affect forest birds including other biodiversity within the forest. Our objective is to examine how these habitat modifications relate to the distribution, abundance and resource exploitation by three rare bird species and three forest specialist birds that occur in Arabuko-Sokoke forest. Specifically, students will use census data, mist netting and the foraging behavior observations to determine the environmental and ecological factors that either promote the success or threaten the survival of these species. The PI collaborates with Alfred Owino, Research Scientist with Biodiversity Research and Monitoring Division at the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) who will be involved in co-mentorship.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project directly addresses concerns that Seymour and Hewitt offered to explain the exodus from science fields: lack of confidence, competitive atmosphere and dullness of subject matter. Students will investigate how birds respond to habitat heterogeneity, and in the end identify the axes of environmental heterogeneity that promote species survival and coexistence. This project will provide US students with opportunity for self discovery through ?hands-on? training in field ecology that includes, field preparations, experimental designs, data collection and analysis, writing and research presentation in workshops, conferences and relevant scientific publications. The proposed research investigations will advance science by elucidating mechanisms structuring the bird community of Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, which includes resource use, resource partitioning and mechanisms of coexistence.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Wilbur Wright College is a Minority Serving and Hispanic Serving Institution of about 6000 students that is part of the City Colleges of Chicago. This student population increase the diversity of the STEM talent pool from which the nation?s future scientific talent and technical force will be drawn. The proposed study is also ranked among the priority studies by the wildlife management authority in Kenya. The data from this research would provide the required information for the long-term conservation of the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest. In addition, the research will further the knowledge and expertise of local naturalists and tour guides, and indirectly further their careers. <br/><br/>This award is co-funded by NSF's Division of Environmental Biology, Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/>"

The program is designed based on industry feedback obtained through a survey and meetings with industry.  Students in this program master biotechnology laboratory skills in the context of both increased academic knowledge, and what they need to know to work in the industry; for example the development and use of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs). The majority of students finish the program in 2 to 3 semesters, ending with a capstone research project. This project is done at HWC, or in a partnering University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) laboratory, or at a biotechnology company.

Use               of this instrumentation enables our student population to acquire               the laboratory skills necessary to compete successfully when they               transfer to baccalaureate programs or seek professional                         employment.  The institution is matching the NSF grant with an                  equal amount of funds."

However, due to its short average lifetime (2.2 microseconds), it has not been possible to accelerate a muon beam. A key step in demonstrating the feasibility of muon accelerators is the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE).  The main obstacle to accelerating an intense muon beam is that the way such beams are created makes them too large to fit into the vacuum chamber of a synchrotron, and the short muon lifetime leaves little time to shrink the beam. Ionization cooling is a new technique to shrink, or cool a muon beam quickly.  The goal of MICE is to build a section of an ionization-cooling channel, instrument it to measure its cooling performance, and use a muon beam produced at a particle accelerator to demonstrate that it works as designed.  A collaborative effort of some 150 physicists and engineers from Europe, Asia, and the US, MICE is being mounted at England's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.  Construction of the apparatus is currently in progress, and the running of the experiment and analysis of its results is expected to take place during the 3-year period of the grant proposed here.  This proposal requests renewal funding for the Illinois Institute of Technology MICE group in support of continued US leadership in muon cooling and in the muon accelerator facilities that might be constructed, in the US or elsewhere, once the feasibility of ionization cooling is demonstrated.  The broader impact of this work is most evident in the use of an accelerated muon beam for a Neutrino Factory recognized as the most powerful tool yet conceived in the quest to understand the mysterious oscillatory behavior of the neutrino and its possible role in the evolution of the matter-dominated Universe in which we live.  In addition, the pace of MICE development, running, and analysis is particularly well suited to the training of students.  MICE will take approximately three years to complete, a good fit to the typical physics student?s graduate training."

The weather satellite station serves as                  a particularly strong tool for clarifying scientific concepts                   to  non-science students by making it possible for them to                      conduct experiments that are directly related to their everyday                 activities.  For example, students are predicting local weather                 and comparing their predictions to those of the weather service                 and the actual weather conditions."
