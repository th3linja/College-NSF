A two year Associate of Applied Science Degree in Agriculture and Food Technology was achieved by Hawkeye Community College as a Phase I project funded by a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant.  Hawkeye Community College along with Kirkwood Community College and Lansing Community College is currently validating and implementing a coordinated precision agriculture curriculum in the Midwest.  This precision agriculture model design incorporates modules and courses in precision farming, environmental science, and geographic information systems with a core of applied mathematics and science courses to augment the Agriculture and Food Technology curriculum.  Thus, this increases the flexibility of the Agriculture and Food Technology curriculum for use by other community colleges in the Midwest.  Five additional participating Midwestern community colleges each are developing a certificate program, implementing the current program, or integrating the agriculture technology program into current agricultural programs.    Each of the participating community colleges is forming a linkage with K - 12 school(s) and a university.  By expanding the use of this curriculum to K - 12 schools, mathematics and science skills can be enhanced through application of precision agriculture.  Preservice teachers and current teachers are being offered workshops in precision agriculture technology and conferences to coordinate discussion on articulation between educational levels.  An outcome of this effort is a coordinated Precision Agriculture curriculum that provides a seamless career pathway while providing mathematics and science skills necessary for technological advanced careers."

In the past two years rapid changes have occurred in  technology in the field of food systems.  Technology changes  involving biotechnology, chemical usage, GPS/GIS satellites, and  computer/telecommunication networks will continue into the next  century.  For farmers to remain competitive in the food industry,  they and the food systems sales and service people supporting them,  must be trained in this new technology.  ""There will be fewer and  larger farm operations, still individually owned and operated by  families, but more businesslike...And to be profitable, the farmer  will have to use technology"" (KSU AE REPORT, Fall 1994).  Hawkeye  Community College proposes to plan and test an innovative 63 credit  hour curriculum which would link the agricultural and business  experience with technology.  The curriculum and all support  materials would then be used in expanding articulation agreements  with the secondary schools and four year institutions including a  land grant university who are interested in updating agricultural  curriculum into food systems.  The materials would also be  disseminated through national education associations, journals, and  telecommunication system."
