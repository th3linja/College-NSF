The primary disciplinary foci are Electrical, Computer, and Software Engineering (ECSE) with the inclusion of cyber-security at Iowa State University (ISU); Des Moines Area Community College (DMACC) and Kirkwood Community College (KCC). The project plans to award scholarships to 272 students (100 unique scholars at Iowa State University; 90 unique scholars at Des Moines Area Community College; and 82 unique scholars at Kirkwood Community College. <br/><br/>The student experience model includes a set of well-established evidence-based practices that form an ecosystem of academic and co-curricular supports for students and is designed to foster retention, transfer, and graduation in STEM. The research team will conduct two research studies of this ecosystem of supports. The qualitative phenomenological study is designed to investigate and understand the development and maintenance of professional/career identity.  The quantitative comparison study is designed to investigate the influence of individual motivation and the characteristics of the academic and social environments of ECSE on student success, retention, transfer, and degree attainment."

Retention is being increased by a new learning community model, called a learning village or meta-community. The learning village model incorporates various learning communities as well as service learning projects for engineering students in their second and third years of study. First-year and gateway engineering courses are being reviewed to better engage students, to provide flexibility, and to support transfer students. The ACCESS program makes gateway courses available through distance education. Student-centered advising broadens the diversity of students enrolled in engineering and makes students aware of the various paths to successfully completing an engineering degree, including transfer from a community college. ISU Extension is a partner on the project to develop the STEM TEC (Talent in Every County) initiative."

The high school program, Female Recruits Explore Engineering (FREE), was implemented in 10 public schools in 3 states (CO, IA, and OH), from 2006-2009. FREE began with 131 mostly urban, Latina, Black, Native American and Asian American girls who were strong students in math and science. The proposed study will follow all the young women who stayed in FREE during high school and their first post-high school year (n=81). In this group, 22% are pursuing engineering majors, 35% are in other STEM majors, 33% are pursuing non-STEM majors, and 10% are undecided. Pierre Bourdieu's ""social capital"" framework will be employed to analyze the capital the participants brought with them and will have used in college, including that gained in FREE, to pursue their college goals. The concept of ""educational pathways"" will be used to examine the dynamic interplay between institutional structures for pursuing college degrees, sources of support in college, and individual decisions and choices made in college. Data will include information about the young women's high school backgrounds, experiences and lives (observation; interviews; demographic, self-efficacy and social network surveys; Blackberry PIN, Messenger and email messages; website and Facebook postings) from the FREE project. Comparable new data will be collected about the women's college experiences through Facebook postings, interviews and surveys. The qualitative data will be analyzed by creating a coding scheme of a priori categories (based on the research questions) and in situ (emerging from the data) categories and managed with the ATLAS.ti software program. Survey data will be analyzed with descriptive statistics, and where survey questions have been drawn from national surveys, those data will be used to make national comparisons.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research seeks to impact the broader education community and society as a whole by: illuminating the connections between forms of capital and choice for or against careers in engineering and other STEM fields; contributing to policies and programs for increasing diversity in STEM fields; involving non-privileged students in research related to their STEM circumstances and options; preparing graduate students in Education, Women's Studies, and STEM fields for research on education-related issues, particularly those involving under-represented populations; and widely disseminating results through diverse sources, such as peer-reviewed journals, STEM-oriented associations, the FREE website, college-oriented websites and magazines, local and national press, and speaking engagements."

It is also developing a comprehensive marketing and recruitment plan to attract students to the program and inform them about ET career and educational pathways. Ultimately, the program is increasing the quality and availability of individuals in Iowa pursuing technology related careers, providing clearly articulated educational pathways, and filling a gap in the needs of the business community for highly qualified ET employees.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The AAS curriculum is being developed to align with the standards of the Accrediting Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). This accreditation is offering students an improved chance of finding employment or of pursuing a baccalaureate degree through an articulation agreement with a partner institution.  Implementation of an ABET-accredited curriculum is a unique approach to attracting more individuals, including those from underrepresented groups, into technology related fields of study since ABET accreditation provides assurance that a college program meets the quality standards established by the profession. It also adds a level of confidence to participants that the program contains the foundation and skills directly aligned with the intended career. A critical ABET component is the continuous improvement aspect of education, ensuring that the program exercises a high degree of self-analysis as to content and quality. The project also includes outreach efforts to high school students and their parents that are designed to provide information on the careers available in ET and the benefits of pursuing an educational path in this field. High school teachers and counselors are receiving similar information along with professional development opportunities. Formative and summative evaluations are assisting in determining the impact of the retooled curriculum and its implementation at the high school level, along with additional activities provided along the career and educational pathways pursued by program participants.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This project is increasing recruitment, completion, and retention of ET students through implementation of an industrially-relevant and rigorous program of study and thereby increasing the skilled workforce in Iowa. Employers across the state have indicated an unmet need for qualified technology employees and studies indicate an overall lack of the middle-skill employees that are critical to the manufacturing sector in the state. This project is serving as a model for providing ET instruction both at the community college level and through high school Career Academies, thus fostering an interest among high school students as they decide upon their future educational plans. The materials developed during this project, including the AAS and summer camp curricula, marketing materials, and professional development materials, are being made available to institutions across the state and the nation with the intent that the information could be utilized and/or modified asynchronously and independently. Articulation agreements that are being developed with four-year institutions in Iowa are applicable to similar technology programs at community colleges throughout the state."
