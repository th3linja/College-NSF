Abraham DUE 9551243 WESTERN IOWA TECH FY1995 $ 16,659 Sioux City, IA 511020265 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Chemistry Title: Modular Chemistry Laboratory for Community College Students An FT-IR, gas chromatograph, and supporting computers and computer software are being used in a modular course in instrumental analysis. The course is being offered in three modules of 5-weeks each to non-science majors, electronic engineering technology students, and internationally educated students who have had little opportunity to use laboratory equipment. High school students as well as technicians working in local industries have opportunities to learn to use the equipment as well. The project is having a significant impact on undergraduate students by providing access to science within a positive, non-intimidating environment. The challenge is to provide learning experiences and curricular content that are relevant, learner-friendly, interesting, and exciting, and which stimulate the interest of non-science students to enroll in subsequent science courses. A pre and post survey will be given to assess the student interest/knowledge in science. The impact of the project will be disseminated to regional and national ACS and science education conferences."

Preference is given to females, racial and ethnic minorities, and persons with disabilities. The goals of the program are increase the number of academically talented, low-income students, who enter and persist in programs leading to baccalaureate degree or a career and to decrease the number of science and technology jobs that go unfilled, or are outsourced, in the region each year due to a lack of qualified professionals. Its objectives are to ensure 70% of the participants achieve a grade point average of at least 3.0 and persist through graduation utilizing an array of comprehensive support services and to disseminate program activities that prove successful in increasing the participation of students, especially females, racial and ethnic minorities, and persons with disabilities in mathematics, science, and technology careers.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project is a coordinated and collaborative effort of faculty and staff representing program related academic and administrative departments and an Advisory Council. Project activities include recruitment and selection of academically talented individuals with financial need; development of an Individualized Education and Career Plan by each student; extracurricular activities to deepen participants' knowledge of the subject areas, careers, and/or additional higher education options; and work based learning opportunities to enhance career preparation.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The project design applies current research and best practices, with progress to be measured by a fully integrated evaluation plan relying on formative and summative methods. Evaluation is facilitating program improvements and assisting staff in identifying successful strategies and variables. Successful strategies are being disseminated throughout the state and region by presentations at conferences and symposia, the project website, and the College's participation in the NSF Midwest Center for Information Technology (MCIT). This project is designed to align with strategic goals for economic development in the region and the state of Iowa by concentrating on developing the science and math literacy of the future workforce. This project, by targeting low-income individuals, women, minorities and individuals with disabilities is broadening the pool of students with access to post secondary education and professional career fields."
