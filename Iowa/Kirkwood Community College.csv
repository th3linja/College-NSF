Sixteen AgrowKnowledge Community College Partners and their local secondary programs, a five member University Council, and an active Industry Council share a vision for 21st century agricultural technology education in which students from diverse backgrounds: <br/> 1.  Pursue rigorous, high quality programs of study in Agriculture, Food, and Natural Resources (AFNR) with coursework that emphasizes technology, mathematics, and science skills;  <br/>2.  Move through a seamless educational system with clear articulation plans among secondary schools, community colleges, and universities; and <br/>3.  Graduate from college well prepared for a dynamic and increasingly technological workforce. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the Center is in its effort to expand curriculum and faculty development and to institutionalize science, mathematics, and technology as an integral part of student learning in agriculture technology education.  By having the University Council as part of the consortium, AgrowKnowledge adds a research component, particularly in the areas of articulation, recruitment, teacher education, and technology transfer.  Their involvement, with that of the Industry Council, also helps validate curriculum and instruction projects, which are aligned with national standards for science, mathematics, and technology. <br/> <br/>The broader impact of the Center is on students who, because of their exposure to emerging technology, find themselves better prepared to enter agricultural careers, whether assuming responsibility for the family farm, working as an industry technician, or continuing their education for a professional degree in agriculture science, research, or education.  The 16 AgrowKnowledge Partners reach out to a growing number of community colleges and secondary schools. As a result, the Center is producing educational models, workshops, curriculum guides, and instructional materials for an ever larger number of students and faculty across the country. The AgrowKnowledge Center's purpose is to create systems that support student success; to provide curriculum with advanced science, mathematics, and technology skills integrated; and to develop community college faculty who use that curriculum or enhance their own courses and programs.  Activities include the following: <br/> <br/>1.  Tracking student enrollment and develop recruiting tools to include recruitment of underrepresented students. <br/>2.  Tracking changes in selected community college agriculture students' mathematics and science scores. <br/>3.  Expanding the strong participation of 16 Lead Community College Partners to include formal recruitment of 32 additional community colleges;  <br/>4.  Increasing the number of faculty involved in Faculty Development Workshops by instituting a process that replicates the workshops regionally;  <br/>5.  Increasing community college partnerships with secondary and post-secondary schools and business and industry by holding Vision 2020 planning institutes, a process for building those partnerships and encouraging 2+2+2 articulation;  <br/>6.  Developing curriculum guides for areas of study that support the use of emerging technology in agriculture to include identification and/or development of programs of study, coursework, and computer-based Learning Objects. <br/>7.  Enhancing the replication of curriculum with science, technology, and mathematics integrated through the website clearinghouse. <br/> <br/>While agriculture education might once have been considered a diminishing part of the community college system, today there is a renewed vitality, in part because of the efforts of AgrowKnowledge members who are recruiting new students, especially from underrepresented categories, and finding new ways to excite students about a promising future for agriculture. <br/>"

""STEPs to Bridge the Way"" offers students support in a seamless transition from high school to community college and on to a four-year degree program through 2+2+2 articulation efforts. <br/><br/>The objectives are to: <br/>1. Increase by at least 10% the number of secondary school students who participate in STEM Career Edge Academies, and other dual high school and college credit programs each year. <br/>2. Increase by 25% over five years the number of students at the college with a declared major in one of the STEM disciplines. <br/>3. Improve the retention and persistence of STEM students at the college by 20% over five years. <br/>4. Increase the number of students who graduate with a STEM-related associate degree from the college and/or transfer to four-year institutions as STEM majors. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit is reflected in the efforts across three educational levels: secondary, community college, and four-year institutions. Students have financial resources available, as well as solid academic support through coursework, exploration, tutoring, and mentoring. Efforts to generate excitement about STEM include 1) outreach activities to promote career awareness, 2) recruitment and preparation through a Summer Bridge program for students who want to explore and/or accelerate study in STEM disciplines; and 3) the addition of a Science Career Edge Academy in which high school students earn college credit for coursework they take at their high schools. Retention efforts at the community college center on a Technology Seminar, mentoring, and expanded use of support services. Articulation efforts are expanding, moving beyond course-by-course articulation to program articulation. One additional element that provides a solid foundation for the success of the entire project is a summer faculty workshop, spanning all three levels of academia. The professional development topics include recruitment, pedagogy, technology, and articulation.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this project is twofold. First, Skills 2006 reports the need for over 10,000 employees in the area by 2006, with the highest job growth in STEM disciplines. 75% of new and replacement jobs require education beyond high school with 60% of new jobs requiring a four-year degree or greater. By broadening students' career perspectives and encouraging them to pursue STEM disciplines, this project plays a role in filling the workforce needs in Eastern Iowa. Second, the collaboration with secondary and four-year institutions and the efforts to recruit underrepresented students into STEM offers a solid foundation for improvement in STEM programs across three levels of academia, increased availability for a STEM education, and a smoother transition for students as they work toward their educational goals in attaining a STEM career."
