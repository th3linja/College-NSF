The project team will work to modularize existing curricula as well as develop a core curriculum that will be used by advanced manufacturing technician tracks. The Northeast Iowa Community College NICC and a number of industry members and northeast Iowa secondary schools will collaborate closely in completing the project.<br/><br/>This study will examine the skills and body of knowledge required across advanced manufacturing technician occupations. Project activities will include 1) an analysis of common curricula in multiple technician programs, 2) training opportunities for secondary school teachers and College faculty to better align curriculum along the K-14 experience, 3) development of distance learning options to expand access, 4) a study of the efficacy of an open lab model that enables high school, college, career pathway students, and industry professionals to work simultaneously, 5) development of work experience options for technician students including apprenticeships. The results of this project will build on a body of evidence documenting the benefits of open lab structure, competency-based education, and co-operative education. Project activities will align the efforts of secondary educators, community college faculty, and industry needs."

The program includes field-based experiences, hands-on practice with modern instrumentation, integration of technical and 21st century skills, and establishment of clear pathways from secondary schools to Northeast Iowa Community College (NICC) to four-year programs. The project is developing a curriculum that includes problem-based learning scenarios in partnership with business and industry and providing professional development for educators to increase the availability of rural instructors for advanced Project Lead the Way (PLTW) classes to assist in career pathway development for area high schools. The project demonstrates intellectual merit by improving student learning through a program based on evidence-based best practices and business and industry input; building on a body of evidence documenting the need for students to develop both technical and 21st century skills; utilizing an evaluation plan clearly tied to project outcomes and developed in collaboration with a well-experienced evaluator; and planning for ABET-accreditation of the program. Broader impacts include replicable models of collaboration with local employers, recruitment of women and rural technicians, and an engineering talent pipeline from secondary school to associate's degree to bachelor's degree."
