Each year, up to 30 scholarship recipients are to engage in career exploration conferences, undergraduate research with a capstone event featuring participant research, professional portfolio development, membership in the Iowa Academy of Science, and a STEM Exploration Trip.  Additionally, faculty mentoring and cohort study table activities are planned to increase student retention to degree achievement.  At graduation, Iowa Lakes' Infinity Scholars are well-prepared to become leaders and innovators in technical areas of national need.<br/>  <br/>Intellectual Merit: The program builds upon Iowa Lakes' first S-STEM program in which 144 participants maintained an average GPA of 3.50, well above the college average of 2.76.  Experienced Principal Investigators plan to expand this success through the addition of more intensive career exploration, participation in goal-focused cohorts, and professional networking. The Infinity Scholars program success is to be measured against eligible, non-participant student baseline data for Iowa Lakes and STEM degree programs in a project database.  <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The Infinity Scholars program is to advance learning and discovery through participant travel, professional networking, and opportunities for undergraduate research.  Iowa Lakes' designation as the Northwest Iowa STEM Hub is to allow program information to be quickly disseminated to gifted students throughout the region and the state, and will be an effective means for recruiting individuals from underrepresented groups."

Early CADD courses relied on computer platforms to augment lab work performed on drawing boards. Today, drafting and design is performed almost exclusively on computers, and recently, at several locations, simultaneously. Today's hardware must support today's sophisticated software applications for manufacturing, architecture, civil engineering and geographic information systems (GIS). Early CADD focused on two-dimensional techniques and fledgling applications; today's computer platforms must support three-dimensional techniques, solids modeling, rendering, and animation. The sophistication of software programming and the need to support the explosion in digital communications are driving the demand for newer and faster computers. Educational institutions, especially those in relatively remote areas, are challenged to find adequate resources to update software and hardware that have increasingly shorter shelf lives. This upgrade will provide students an improved vehicle to initiate collaboration with other users on a global basis. Efforts for educational collaboration among institutions are currently being formulated to take advantage of the improved platform. Approval of this project will provide students, employers and communities with access to emerging technology and the potential to make more informed choices. Good decisions are rooted in competent information, whether decisions are personal, or whether decisions are the result of representative deliberation. Helping people synthesize informed choices is the essence of education."

The project's activities include sponsoring an academic retreat for community college and university faculty to partner with business and industry leaders to identify core competencies and align curriculum with emerging industry standards. Additionally, the project aims to integrate life and agriculture science biotechnology concepts into existing transfer and agriculture degree programs at community colleges, thereby preparing students to enter a rapidly growing job market or pursue higher education goals. It introduces basic research methodology and science pedagogy to students early in their academic careers, building their confidence and stimulating their interest in science.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit<br/>As a result of project activities, (1) biotechnology curricula (and competencies) are developed, piloted, articulated, and disseminated; (2) pre-service, secondary and community college life and agriculture science instructors are trained in at least one area of the biotechnology curriculum, and (3) additional biotechnology education modules are disseminated during an annual summer institute for educators and industry professionals.<br/><br/>Broader impact<br/>Curricular development and dissemination in the areas of animal genome, plant engineering, life science and bioethics drive this project. A partnership of twelve high schools, four community colleges and three universities is piloting the curriculum as it is developed and articulated. Curriculum and materials developed are evaluated by internal and external evaluators, and disseminated through the NSF Bio-Link and AgrowKnowledge websites. Team members are presenting project outcomes at several national and regional conferences."

The goals of the project are to (a) improve educational opportunities for students interested in STEM careers; (b) increase student retention to degree achievement; (c) increase the impact of student support for students enrolled in STEM disciplines; and (d) ultimately increase the numbers of well educated and skilled employees in STEM fields. Creating a learning community and providing tools for success are accomplished through project activities. All participants complete a job shadow and/or internship experience during the freshman year and complete a capstone experience during the sophomore year. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Research-based retention strategies and project activities provide participants with the academic and career exploration support necessary to successfully transfer to a university or transition to the workforce. The project team is partnering with the Institutional Research Office at the college to track similarities and disconnects between participants in the cohort group and a control group. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The project is developing internship opportunities, job shadow experiences, and capstone activities. National employment demand for two-year degree STEM graduates drives this project, and local industry partners have opportunities for these students. Alignment of curricular competencies and strengthening articulations with neighboring transfer universities provide students pursuing a four-year degree with a seamless transition. Blending academic and support services though project strategies increase retention and serve as a replicable model for other colleges."
