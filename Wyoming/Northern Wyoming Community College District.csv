The goals of this project are to 1) increase the pool of trained energy technicians through industry-driven applied education, 2) facilitate high participation of trained energy technicians in the energy workplace, 3) provide pathways for two-year energy technician graduates to AAS and BS programs, 4) provide professional development opportunities for high school teachers and two- and four- year college faculty, and 5) create energy industry awareness in the pre-college schools in the region by implementing summer camps for students in grades 5-9. This project is producing exemplary curricular materials, with significant input from industrial partners. These materials are not only enhancing student learning and preparing them for the workplace, but they are also providing faculty and high school teachers with professional development opportunities."
