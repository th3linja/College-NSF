The Center will engender student and teacher interest in geography by demonstrating ways in which technological advances (computer graphics, high-quality videodiscs) are creating new learning opportunities in this field. Students at Laramie County Community College will be the most immediate beneficiaries of this laboratory facility, but it also will serve as an innovative model and inservice venue for educators and students throughout this region. Geography teachers from Laramie County, professors from the University of Wyoming, and community college instructors will be involved in the design and implementation of the Geographic Studies Center."

Objectives are to improve renewable energy technology programs by increaing academic rigor and relevance; to concurrently grow career pathways; and to enhance and broaden recruitment, retention, and placement efforts with an emphasis on underrepresented populations. LCCC staff, supported by well-qualified curriculum and evaluation consultants, are to provide leadership and administrative management for the project. The primary target audiences include: 1) current and prospective community college students (traditional age and returning adults); 2) postsecondary faculty involved in teaching renewable/wind energy technologies;and 3) other academic and technical faculty interested in the development of a team-based, problem solving learning model. This approach recognizes that the core abilities and foundational competencies for wind energy technology include electricity, hydraulics, fluid power, and mechanical drive systems, which are also the foundational components of other traditional and renewable/alternative energy technologies.  Building upon research, the proposal promises to verify wind energy specific knowledge, skills, and attibutes that combines STEM competencies and industry-driven, performance-based, standards for integrated systems and wind energy technology programs. The partnership is to promote outreach and dissemination efforts at local, regional, and national levels."

The project is also preparing and delivering informational presentations on wind energy technology for the public. The project addresses the paucity of wind energy technology educational programs in America and the growing workforce needs of the western region's expanding wind power industry."
