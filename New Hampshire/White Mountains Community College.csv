(The Objectives) This proposal seeks funding for two faculty enhancement workshops to be held during the summers of 1996 and 1997 to provide opportunities for 24 physics instructors from two- year and four-year colleges and universities in both the northern and southern New England states to learn ways of presenting physics instruction via the Internet and the World Wide Web. (Methods to accomplish the objectives) During the workshops, participants will learn how to create platform-independent physics lessons using the hypertext markup language of browsers such as Netscape which can be shared with other instructors from neighboring New England states. (Collaborations) They will work with the nationally recognized leaders in distance education from institutions including the USAF Academy and Indiana University, Purdue University Indianapolis who have developed innovative new ways to teach using the World Wide Web. (Significance/impact of the project) The workshop will offer the unique opportunity for physics faculty to discuss during a two-week period critical issues in the teaching of college physics using distance education at the two and four-year level and to develop a strategic plan to promote stronger partnerships between two-year and four-year colleges through the sharing of information and resources."

This material will be designed to address a wide audience including:  (1) two-year college students enrolled in science, technology and engineering programs,  (2) non-science majors seeking scientific and technology literacy in anticipation of workplace demands, and  (3) high school students taking physics--in particular those in Tech Prep or vocational education programs.     The software will have a multilevel structure and flexible format to accommodate students with poor backgrounds in science and mathematics, those with some knowledge of algebra and geometry, as well as advanced students.  The project materials, developed from our existing prototypes, employ a ""learning situation-focused"" approach rather than a conventional domain-centered approach to involve students of various backgrounds and abilities in learning physics, science and technology. The goal is to engage students in exploring learning situations associated with their career goals. Each lesson will start with an exploration phase where students will see a real world example of applied physics. They will then enter a theory phase where they will be presented with the underlying physics concepts and laws related to the example. The learning cycle will be completed with an ""application"" phase where they will learn a systematic, expert-like approach to solving scientific and technical problems.    The initial software packages will focus on three broad career-oriented themes. It will include eight interconnected components:  (1) Simulation, Virtual Experimentation,  (2) Problem Solving Tutor,  and (3) Assessment Tool, etc., as well as collection of problems, tests, and questions.  Teachers can modify and expand an open-ended collection of problems, solution plans, tests, queries, and leading questions using their own experience or incorporating diverse curriculum resources, including tho se available on the Web."

Virtual labs are designed to enhance the understanding of technical concepts and master selected performance skills in areas such as steam powered plant equipment, diesel engines, pumps, and valves. This development extends the work of a previously funded project and is built upon Active Learning Suite which has simulations, interactive lessons, a scriptable and animated instructor's assistant, assessment and ancillary tools, and more."

The project seeks to achieve three equally important goals, all related to the combined use of hands-on and simulation-based learning activities for undergraduate-level engineering: (1) research and evaluate the comparative impact of various pedagogical methods using hands-on, simulation-based, and hybrid activities in terms of their effects on knowledge, skills, and attitudes; (2) develop hybrid labs for selected engineering content areas that exemplify various ways of integrating hands-on and simulation-based activities; and (3) produce a set of general pedagogical and curriculum development guidelines for how to combine actual and virtual activities in engineering education.<br/><br/>Project IVEHOL will research the effectiveness and impact of hands-on labs, virtual experiments and hybrid activities on different learning and teaching styles and instructional settings. The project will create innovative hybrid activities that logically integrate realistic simulations with either traditional college laboratory experiments, which employ educational labware, or with industrial testing and control equipment used by businesses and industry for training engineers and technicians. Integrated simulations expand hands-on labs by providing an inside view of the process and thus it can bridge hands-on observations and measurements with solid science, technology, and mathematics.<br/>"
