Partners in this effort include New Hampshire Community technical College, Community College of Baltimore County-Catonsville, Community College of Rhode Island, Finger Lakes Community College, Montgomery County Community College, and Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School. <br/><br/>Each of the centers forms a Hub through which a network is being developed with the local biotechnology/biomedical industry, educational institutions, professional associations and government to prepare a technical workforce for the region's rapidly increasing biomanufacturing industry. The Hubs are 1) Developing resources for the biomanufacturing community; 2) Facilitating annual workshops that engage the biotechnology community in their region; 3) Establishing sustainable learning communities to support students pursuing a career in biomanufacturing; 4) Developing educational pathways and articulation agreements between high schools, community colleges, and universities; 5) Developing and adapting biomanufacturing curricula and instructional materials to create a technology workforce for the rapidly changing biomanufacturing industry; 6) Providing professional development opportunities for biomanufacturing faculty members; and 7) Maintaining a website at www.biomanufacturing.org that provides communication between hubs, supports project management and provides a method through which curricula and instructional materials are being developed, tested and delivered. <br/><br/>Biomanufacturing curriculum and education materials are being developed to produce high-quality, but individually distinct biotechnology programs at each of the Hubs to meet the needs of the industries within their service area. Workshop participants are engaging in curriculum development by providing feedback, suggesting modifications, and deploying the instructional materials in their classrooms. Utilizing the processes already developed at Minuteman Technical High School each of the Hubs is assisting in the development of high school biotechnology programs, developing articulation agreements between high schools and their Hub, developing processes to recruit and retain minority students and leveraging their outreach programs through a Department of Labor National Biomanufacturing Apprenticeship System for recent high school graduates. Industrial involvement is providing employment pathways for AA degree recipients, summer internships for faculty members at biomanufacturing companies, and input on curriculum development to support their training needs. Dissemination is through their website and linked to Bio-Link's website at www.bio-link.org.<br/>"

Building on prior accomplishments supported by federal funding under the Department of Labor's Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training program, this project focuses the new-collar field of mechatronics, which combines mechanical, electronic, and computer technologies.  Mechatronics technicians work with 3D printers, electromechanical systems, robotic devices, and other technologies to contribute to sectors ranging from agriculture and advanced manufacturing to renewable energy and telecommunications.  The project will implement the Siemens Mechatronic Systems curriculum to develop a stackable, industry-recognized certification program and an Associate of Science degree. The Siemens curriculum uses a systems approach to mechatronics education that emphasizes how multiple technologies coexist and interact. This approach helps students learn how to troubleshoot, maintain, and operate an entire automated system, rather than just individual components.  As a result, students who complete the mechatronics certification and/or degree will be prepared for well-paying jobs in growing industries, thus contributing to the US skilled technical workforce and economy.<br/><br/>This project has four goals:  1) redevelop the curriculum to realign the current Advanced Manufacturing Mechatronics Certificate with the Siemens Mechatronics Level 1 Certification; 2) provide professional development and training for College faculty to earn Siemens Level 1 Mechatronics Instructor certification; 3) investigate the program enhancements needed to implement Siemens Level 2 certification at a later date; 4) raise interest in and awareness of an advanced manufacturing career involving mechatronics in the local area. The project will leverage the work of other NSF Advanced Technological Education (ATE) projects to build low cost mechatronics training kits and will disseminate the curriculum and materials it develops to the ATE community. As traditional manufacturing becomes more automated and dependent on computers, the need for technicians with advanced problem-solving skills is increasing. This project will contribute to educating this next generation of skilled technical workers.   This project is funded by the NSF ATE program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

(EDC), and industry and community college partners are working together to develop a Northeast Regional Biomanufacturing Center. This project involves three components: working with partners to develop the foundation for a Center; determining biomanufacturing job competencies for technicians and supervisors; and beginning the development of a biotechnology equipment and supplies resource center.<br/><br/>The Northeast Region has a large, growing need for skilled biomanufacturing technicians. A 2000 survey by the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council predicted that between September 2001 and September 2002, the Massachusetts/New Hampshire/Rhode Island corridor would create over 1,000 new biomanufacturing jobs. The expansion of two facilities in Rhode Island by 2005 will produce an estimated 800-1000 additional biomanufacturing technician jobs. In Maryland, the 16,000 biotechnology work force is expected to double in size in a few years. To compound this situation, manufacturing supervisors report significant turnover rates of current manufacturing workers because they lack appropriate skills. A biomanufacturing education center is needed, and there needs to be coordination throughout the region. This project is beginning that process."

The project is particularly focused on recruiting current high school students completing an IT pathway or who have earned a grade of B or higher in one of the IST or CT Running Start (dual enrollment) courses.  <br/> <br/>Intellectual Merit:  The project objectives are (1) to provide scholarships to academically talented, financially disadvantaged students; (2) to increase the number of students in IT programs or Project Running Start courses in high school enrolling directly into associate degree programs in Computer Science by 50%; (3) to provide support to NEXT STEP scholars that enable a minimum of 70% to complete first semester math and English courses with a grade of C or better and persist to achievement of an associate degree (4) to develop at least ten new internship sites for second year CSEMS students. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The project increases the number of students pursuing career in information technology and can be used as a benchmark for other institutions offering similar programs. Support for the success and retention of these scholars includes new advising models that are being integrated into the college by the acquisition of a recent Title III grant, and requirement of mathematics summer remediation if placement tests show there is a need.   <br/>"
