"1900165","Improving Mechatronics Education by Pairing Mechatronics Courses with General Education Math and Science Courses","DUE","Advanced Tech Education Prog","07/01/2019","09/17/2019","Elizabeth Weaver","TN","Roane State Community College","Standard Grant","Virginia Carter","06/30/2022","$299,793.00","Eric Bouldin, Gordon Williams","weaverea@roanestate.edu","276 Patton Lane","Harriman","TN","377485011","8653543000","EHR","7412","1032, 9178, SMET","$0.00","By 2024, in the area surrounding Roane State Community College, employment in electrical and electronics repair of commercial and industrial equipment is expected to increase by five percent. In contrast, the national growth rate is only two percent. Regional employers report that they have difficulty finding ""business-oriented"" or ""well-rounded"" technicians to fill their positions.  In particular, many candidates do not have the necessary knowledge, skills and abilities, such as critical thinking, applied knowledge, and complex problem-solving skills. Based on  a recent survey of employers, defining and solving problems, particularly numerical problems, and thinking critically were among recent graduates' weakest skills. To better meet industry needs for a highly-skilled technical workforce, this project will pair mechatronics courses with general education courses in math and science.  The general education courses will be enhanced with mechatronics-related problems and examples, thus providing a context that is relevant to the students' career goals.  Local area employers will be integrally involved in course development and provide examples of complex mechatronics issues that can be incorporated into problem-based learning scenarios within the courses.  It is expected that these paired courses will result in mechatronics graduates who are better prepared both academically and technically for work in mechatronics fields. <br/><br/>Roane State Community College aims to improve the technical skills of mechatronics students by designing and implementing three co-requisite course pairs.  Each course pair will include a mechatronics course and one of the following: (a) a general education math course, (b) a learning support (developmental) math course, or (c) a general education science course. The project expects that these curricular changes will increase students' attainment of related learning outcomes, the number of students completing the general education core courses and programs, and employer satisfaction with graduates' knowledge, skills, and abilities. The co-requisite course pairs may provide replicable examples for enhancing mechatronics education at other institutions. In addition, the process used to develop this co-requisite model for teaching general education and mechatronics may be extended to other career-technical areas at Roane State Community College and at other colleges and universities. This project is expected to increase the degree completion rate of first-generation students for whom math and general education courses often pose a major hurdle to degree attainment. Because both faculty and industry partners will be involved in the development of the co-requisite courses, graduates of the program should be better prepared to meet employer expectations for mechatronics technicians in the workplace. Furthermore, the implementation plan and training materials could be adapted to co-requisite pairings in other post-secondary STEM education programs.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project team includes K-12 school systems, two-year and four-year colleges, and business leaders of the Tennessee Innovation Valley Nano Alliance. In order to support the growth of Tennessee's Innovation Valley, educational institutions and local industries are developing high-quality programs to educate skilled, versatile nanotechnology technicians.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: The project team is using a collaborative planning process that is influencing science, math, and technology education at the secondary and postsecondary levels. The planning process includes: identifiying appropriate fields of nanotechnology education that can have the greatest positive impact on the regional economy; identifying industry and academic skill standards; identifying best practices in curriculum and instructional delivery in the region; strengthening partnerships among the various organizations; identifying professional development needs; identifying needs and barriers to recruitment of students and developing strategies to address them; and developing an operational structure for implementation of regional center activities. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: This project is increasing collaboration among regional educational institutions, business and industry, and scientific research organizations, and supporting students from middle school through college programs and into the workplace. The project is also developing strategies for extending access and broadening participation of underrepresented and underserved groups. There is strong support from the state of Tennessee that helps ensure wide impact within the state."

Students are gaining experience with their own spectra of organic compounds for spectra structure correlations and learning to operate a modern, programmable, computer- directed spectrophotometer equivalent to those used in industry and national laboratories. The students are doing experiments such as the measurement of the spectra of aniline, the anilinium cation, and nitrobenzene. They are then considering the displacement and enhancement of absorption bands in the spectrum due to the structural substitution of the amino group on the aromatic ring, the disappearance of the shift and enhancement when the amino group is converted to the anilinium cation, and the appearance of additional bands when the structural change involves substitution of a nitro group on the benzene ring. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources."
