Community colleges are positioned to educate highly skilled workers for these jobs. According to utility industry trade associations, a crisis is remerging from the unprecedented number of water/wastewater facility operators who will be retiring in ten years or less. The water/wastewater utility industry is asking community colleges to establish a pipeline of new workers capable of passing state certification examinations and taking over the management of the facilities that supply clean water. Pellissippi State Community College proposes to establish a new Environmental Science Technology Associate of Applied Science Degree. Graduates will be eligible for employment in regional water quality and wastewater treatment laboratories and plant facilities. In addition, they will be able to take state certification exams more quickly than workers who have been trained on the job. A successful program could be replicated by the other 12 Tennessee community colleges, as well as community colleges across the nation.<br/><br/>This project will: 1) Develop and incorporate the necessary courses into a program of study leading to the Environmental Science Technology (EST) Associate of Applied Science degree and recruit students into that degree program; 2) Build a partnership network with area utility districts to support: student participation in field and internship experiences; faculty collaborations with current technicians to develop and adapt the core STEM course curriculum; and identification of specific industry standards; 3) Graduate a total of 36 EST majors for immediate entry into the workforce at water/wastewater treatment facilities or other related jobs in the East Tennessee region and beyond. Pellissippi State Community College will recruit a diverse group of students for the project via a vigorous media and outreach campaign. Retention, degree completion, and transition to employment will be supported by advising, academic and career counseling, supplemental instruction, student success coordinators, and tutoring. Senior industry management will serve on the advisory board, assist with curriculum design, provide internships and field experiences, and hire graduates as appropriate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Seven community colleges (Northeast State Technical Community College, Walters State Community College, Roane State Community College, Cleveland State Community College, Chattanooga State Technical Community College, Motlow State Community College, Pellissippi State Technical Community College) and two four-year universities (East Tennessee State University and Tennessee Technological University) within the Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR) system have joined together to develop a common core of courses for teachers consisting of an introduction to teaching and technology course and standards-based mathematics and science courses.  The common core is providing seamless transfer from community college to university and among institutions.  The project supports faculty members in developing research based content and pedagogy for the courses through summer faculty development institutes, communication via a collegial network, and travel to state and national conferences.  Through the grant, each institution is developing a resource area to support student learning in the courses.  Students are exposed to a number of technologies as they progress through the program.  Students also receive encouragement to pursue teaching careers through strengthened future teacher organizations and Praxis I Success Workshops.  A teaching and technology course includes early field experiences to help students determine their level of commitment to the teaching profession.  In-service teachers participate in sections of some of the courses developed for pre-service teachers.  The development of this core of standards-based courses for teachers directly addresses the research evidence that suggests that content knowledge must be the central focus in the preparation of teachers.  <br/> <br/><br/>"

The project will increase the participation of financially-disadvantaged, nontraditional students in post-secondary opportunities in high-demand STEM areas in East Tennessee.  Support services will be designed and implemented to ensure that scholars successfully complete an associate degree and are prepared to either enter the workforce or transfer to a four-year institution upon graduation.  Real-world experiences through targeted strategies such as internships, mentoring, and shadowing with assistance of established partnerships with local industry will support the successful transition of scholars into either employment or continuing post-secondary education.<br/><br/>Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected for both a formative and summative evaluation that will measure the overall impact of the program.  A comparison of student success and graduation rates will be performed between scholars who are required to use these support services versus students who voluntarily use these services.  Research will focus on the efficacy of support services and interventions that support the retention of scholars, specifically focusing on improving the success of under-resourced, nontraditional students in STEM disciplines.  The results of this study will be disseminated to the higher education academic community and will provide guidance on intervention strategies such as scholarship programs, cohorts, supplemental instruction, and experiential learning for recruiting and retaining under-resourced students in STEM disciplines in a two-year college environment."

These MASTER Hubs are innovative learning environments surrounding preservice and inservice teachers with fun and interesting mathematics, science, and technology materials and experiences. The purpose of the Hubs is to recruit, train, and support prospective teachers in a teacher preparation project that is a collaboration among PSTCC, K-12 students and teachers, four-year universities and local mathematics and science resources. <br/><br/>A number of articulation pathways are available to PSTCC preservice teachers; however, the focus of the current project is a program in which Tennessee Technological University (TTU) provides its four-year education licensure program on the PSTCC campus. This program includes new reformed science and mathematics courses developed and implemented by PSTCC faculty, as well as upper level education courses offered by TTU faculty at the MASTER Hub sites. The curriculum also includes an early exposure to the teaching profession through a field experience course integrated with instructional technology.<br/>Recruitment of new teachers is being addressed through open houses at the MASTER Hubs, as well as recruiting visits to local area high schools. The participation of underrepresented groups is being actively enlisted through the MASTER Hub on a branch campus of PSTCC located in an Empowerment Zone of Knoxville, TN. <br/><br/>Mentoring teams composed of PSTCC and TTU students, as well as K-12 teachers and K-12 pre-education students provide collegial support among preservice and inservice teachers. These teams also collaborate on curriculum development and applications that contain hands-on, discovery-based pedagogy infused with technology applications. It is expected that newly graduated teachers will continue to participate in mentoring teams, resulting in continued support during their induction into the teaching profession and increased rates of retention."
