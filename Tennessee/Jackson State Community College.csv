Jackson State, a state-supported, public two-year college, serves the substantially rural fourteen-county area of West Tennessee.  Two of these counties are majority African-American with a growing Hispanic population.  Due to its location in a predominantly low-income, rural area, many potential students require substantial amounts of financial aid in order to attend college on a full-time basis.  At this time, Jackson State has no endowment to support student scholarships.  Furthermore, some students are reticent to apply for financial aid.  Thus, this scholarship program funded by the National Science Foundation is improving the perceived image of financial aid and encouraging more students to apply.  College leaders are using an enhanced, systematic and professional program of public information and recruitment to result in forty eligible, full-time students for the three programs involved.<br/><br/>The program is supporting students to successful completion of the two-year degree programs. These support services include: informational recruiting sessions that outline the programs and provide realistic expectations for prospects; cohort selection and organization that enhance the social and intellectual experiences of students; careful selection of classes to ensure progress toward the degree; ongoing support services such as tutoring, special feedback groups, field trips, case-based learning in professional classes, and assignment of a faculty mentor.<br/><br/>Jackson State's technology programs have been structured to offer students a professional experience in both engineering and in computer technology along with incorporated workplace values and communication skills that are presented concurrently throughout the program.  University parallel courses are preparing students for success at the receiving institution, where students perform as well as native students.  The college provides job placement and career guidance to its students, and it maintains close articulation agreements with local and state four-year universities.  Scholarship students who participate in this program are being given careful attention and support throughout their career at Jackson State and beyond to the transfer institution or the workplace.<br/><br/>"

These partnership programs ultimately lead to a Bachelor of Science degree in Precision Agriculture. The unique feature of these articulation agreements is that students not only transfer from the community college to the university, but also from the university to the community college. This inverted degree program with a ""reverse transfer"" format allows students to graduate from both JSCC and a four-year institution, with the fourth year spent at JSCC. JSCC holds technologically sophisticated equipment not available at the partnering universities, and it has developed a number of innovative courses to provide experiential learning opportunities to students in this field. The Precision Agriculture program provides students with theoretical background and hands-on experience in agronomy, GIS, GPS, and computer science. A unique combinations of courses and experiences train students to work in the precision agriculture industry. <br/><br/><br/><br/>"

This project strengthens the existing Precision Agricultural Program by adapting the extensive capital investment of the PAT program with a new Natural Resource Technology A.A.S. degree program. This goal of this program is to produce multi-disciplinary precision agricultural and natural resource technicians with the knowledge, comprehension, and skills to support the need for trained technicians who understand important farming and environmental issues and management challenges of the future. An important aspect of the program is the recruitment of area high school students. The project enables stakeholder groups to participate in collaborative scientific studies in the fields of agronomic science, wildlife and fisheries management, forest management and environmental science.  This project also creates versatile technologically-trained individuals who understand the interconnectedness of the science of agronomy, wildlife, water and forest management and the natural environment at a level to meet industry and research needs; increases employment opportunities for students through service-learning relationships with wildlife, water and forest management agencies, area farm producers and agribusinesses; and enhances connections between the community college and the natural resources community by creating opportunities for collaboration on mutual research projects.<br/>"

Business, industry, and government need well-prepared technicians who can prevent, detect, and investigate cybersecurity breaches, and the growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have appropriate, specific knowledge and skills. The objective of this project is to develop innovative ""puzzles,"" using specialized software, to assist students in learning concepts of and approaches to cybersecurity. Every day, new cyber-attack patterns and vulnerabilities are emerging. Passive methods of cybersecurity education do not adequately prepare students to defend against rapidly evolving, real-world threats. The central idea behind puzzle-based learning is to provide interesting challenges that engage students in thinking about multiple approaches to solving a problem. Puzzles formulate a problem in a specific format that encourages students to use their knowledge and skills and to think ""outside the box.""<br/><br/>The project team will design and develop interactive, multi-level puzzles both for students who have limited knowledge of computers, networks, and cybersecurity and for students who have a moderate to high level of expertise. The complexity of the developed puzzles will be varied based on the target audience. Puzzle-based learning addresses two issues: (1) It places emphasis on developing critical thinking skills instead of simply covering content. (2) It promotes and builds mathematical and logical reasoning skills. Many institutions have already used puzzles in their STEM curricula successfully. Puzzles have been introduced in introductory computer science courses. However, no significant work has been done on introducing puzzles into cybersecurity curricula. The project team will design scenario-based security puzzles that explore a range of topics (such as identifying and neutralizing malicious software, deploying a secure wireless network, and detecting e-mail spam) using logical decision trees, truth tables, and directed graphs. At the end of each exercise, participants will be able trace back their decisions and analyze how an incorrect decision stem can lead to the exploitation of a vulnerability and how correct actions can prevent it. The investigators will phase in the use of these puzzles so as to: i) examine how to effectively integrate such puzzle-based learning technology with instructional content of community college courses to improve the skill sets of front line cyber defenders, and ii) better identify and understand the circumstances under which success occurs. The project team will also conduct a small-scale efficacy study by having students participate in cyber ""capture-the-flag"" competitions to determine if the new enhanced courseware enables increased learning compared to the existing instructional methodology."
