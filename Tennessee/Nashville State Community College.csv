The goal is to develop a sustainable Center to meet need by industry for a qualified IT workforce. Faculty and students in long-term relationships with experts from industry create real world scenarios based on industrial needs and use them as the basis for instruction in IT courses. The learning strategies are developed in workshops at the Center for Learning and Teaching at Vanderbilt University. The cases are used in high school academies to interest high school students in IT careers. A web site provides information about the availability and content of education and training programs in the region, a clearinghouse of job opportunities and regular communications among partners. Regional stakeholder forums bring industry and educators together to develop a shared vision based upon research for effective delivery of instruction. The audience includes both students in educational institutions and re-careering workers. <br/>"

The 56,000 bit per second connection is made through the mid-level network SURANET using the SURANET connection Vanderbilt has had for two years. Two of the institutions are historically black, two are small liberal arts institutions that emphasize teaching rather than research, and one is a two-year technological school. Nashville State is the two-year technical school. Benefits of the NSFNET connection include file transfers, electronic mail communication between local and remote researchers, and remote login to and use of supercomputers and other research facilities. In addition, the local institutions have access to Vanderbilt's resources, and add another dimension to the diversity of resources Vanderbilt can offer its students. Cross- registration, software sharing and other benefits also result from the network."

PBCL is based on yet unsolved problematic local industry situations that require learners to build on their knowledge, engage the situation to build a depth of competence, and reflect on their own thinking and process.  The approach facilitates development of complex communication, expert thinking essential in a global economy and advancement in adaptive expertise.  Over 400 faculty from participating ATE projects have adopted PBCL resulting in improved student learning and professional development of faculty.  Building on what was learned in previous NSF-funded projects and the ideas and input of John Bransford at the LIFE Center at the University of Washington, Nashville State Technical College in partnership with WGBH, produces and disseminates video, web-based and print resources for professional development of faculty and for use in classrooms.  Training teams of experienced practitioners are established at Nashville State Community College and the Midwest Center for Information Technology in Nebraska to extend the effectiveness of PBCL by making the fundamental principles more easily accessible to a wider audience of practitioners.  The effect of the instruction on student performance and employer satisfaction is measured.  The project also evaluates the changes in colleges due to the development of a community of PBCL practitioners.<br/><br/>"

The project creates a network and a process that encourages faculty from different disciplines to develop and disseminate a communications technology curriculum framework. The faculty obtain an understanding of curriculum development techniques and practices. The teams, at each college, consist of seven to ten members including faculty from different departments and representatives from industry, four year universities and secondary schools. The teams encourage the faculty to consider cross disciplinary needs of the curriculum and provide direct access to industrial and four year college input. In addition, the faculty members are provided industrial internships. The outcomes include a system with strong linkages among secondary schools, colleges, industry, and government within the communications technology discipline that educates students in the future needs of the industries served."

The project will assemble experts in case studies and their use from different disciplines to inform the project. The case studies, that mirror real-world workplace problems from industry, are created by interdisciplinary faculty teams that include faculty from science, mathematics, engineering and computer technologies, and communications with input from the industry. Professional development of faculty includes field trips, three-week internships in communications industry to keep abreast of recent developments in the industry and workshops to learn to teach using cases. Dissemination includes professional development for faculty in two-year colleges in other areas of the nation and publication of both the forums on case studies and of the case studies themselves. The use of the case study method is extensively evaluated."

The project is responding to the expectations of the American Chemical Society and recent recommendations by the National Research Council to include the latest developments in science and technology in introductory chemistry curricula. Laboratory experiments from the chemical education literature that utilize FTIR are being adapted for use in introductory chemistry, general chemistry, organic chemistry, and in biology and biotechnology courses. In addition, the FTIR is being utilized to provide hands-on activities for students from a high school located on campus. The presence of the FTIR is enhancing our ability to provide students with the technical skills and motivation to pursue professional careers in science. The impact of this curricular upgrade on student learning and interest in the subject is being evaluated and the results will be disseminated to the larger community."

Information technology (IT) has become a foundation for all work.  Educational programs in IT have made great strides in teaching new technologies, but methods for structuring the learning environment have not changed.  Research in teaching and learning has provided knowledge to educate workers with the ""adaptive expertise"" needed in the workplace, now and in the future.  The workshop, based on the experience of some IT projects, brings together all of the components necessary to help teams of educators and administrators from across the nation develop and implement regional plans for reforming IT education.  The evaluation determines the impact and effectiveness of the implementation and guides similar workshops for the future."

This vision is being realized through the creation of a national community of educators who are skilled and experienced in the delivery of case-based learning. The secondary objective is to develop a systematic process that will capture case ""ideas,"" develop a forum for sharing case concepts with other faculty, and to publish and distribute these materials. ""The Case Files"" follows up the work currently being concluded by the South East Advanced Technological Education Consortium (SEATEC) that has developed model case studies for technological education and evaluated their effectiveness. SEATEC's work has revealed evidence that using cases improves learning and creates a learning centered environment for students. Interest in using the case method has grown among technological educators in the past 3-5 years. Currently, no resource exists for those educators who wish to use the case study method. Three major goals of the project are: improve knowledge and understanding of case studies among technological educators in Tennessee and across the nation; create an on-line clearinghouse for case ""ideas"" and cases developed by faculty; and disseminate case ""ideas"" and fully developed published cases to a national audience. Experienced faculty are mentoring those new to using cases. Partners in the project are Nashville State Technical Institute, the LITEE Center at Auburn University, and the Learning Technology Center at Vanderbilt University."
