Chattanooga State Community College in collaboration with regional industry and the ATE National Center for Welding Education and Training (Weld-Ed) are addressing this challenge by providing faculty development to equip regional community college faculty and high school welding instructors with recruitment strategies and the necessary knowledge and skills to prepare students for nationally recognized skills certifications in critical need areas. A key goal of this project is to advance the knowledge of these welding instructors through a professional development workshop and follow-up activities that address the principles of advanced materials joining and the standards for welding and welding inspection certification. <br/><br/>While the professional development workshop is being offered to instructors, the benefits of the training are far-reaching. Approximately 15 institutions (high schools, 2- and 4-year colleges, and vocational centers) provide welding instruction within the region served by the college. Students in these institutions, whose instructors participate in the workshop, are benefitting from the instructional materials developed and provided to all participants. Students who are introduced to welding inspection may choose to pursue an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) Degree in Engineering Technology with a concentration in Nondestructive Testing Technology. Through an articulation agreement with the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC), individuals who earn an AAS degree in Engineering Technology may continue their education at UTC in pursuit of a baccalaureate degree in Engineering Technology Management. Career prospects are being enhanced for individuals regardless of whether they choose to earn welding or welding inspection certifications or seek to obtain college degrees.<br/><br/>The College offers 21 engineering technology programs that prepare technicians in advanced technology fields, including Welding Engineering Technology and Nondestructive Testing. The Nondestructive Testing program at the college has been accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission of ABET that is recognized as the worldwide leader in assuring quality and stimulating innovation in applied science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology education. The college is the first and only institution within the United States to earn this distinction. This project is leveraging expertise at the college by adapting Weld-Ed curriculum resources to provide faculty development that is updating and expanding welding, materials joining, and nondestructive education in the region and increasing the number of nationally certified technicians available to industry. Participants are also being equipped with strategies and resources for student recruitment for the targeted courses and programs."

Research is  presented which demonstrates the importance of coalition building  and the need for a timely linkage to take the information sharing  from those engaged in development of new technologies and their  applications to the companies that can actually put the  applications into practice. The goal of the proposed planning grant  is to prepare a plan that lays the groundwork for a Center that  will function as a clearinghouse. Through this clearinghouse,  information will be shared statewide and nationally through  conferences, Internet communication and published materials, so  that colleges and universities can provide education for graduates  going into the technology fields.The proposed center will serve as  an intermediary between research organizations and the companies  which use the technology. Using research data from these contacts,  the center can summarize ongoing projects and anticipate the needs  of the manufacturing and service sectors in terms of technology  applications. Ultimately, a research-community college-industry  alliance will develop, producing a defined channel and improved  process for increasing productivity.Six Tennessee two-year colleges  are forming this coalition to develop a plan that is producing a  framework for identifying and developing emerging engineering  technology programs. Components for linkages with industry, other  colleges and universities and high schools are important in the  project."

To remain competitive, U.S. industries need to rapidly accelerate the use of intelligent robotics.  As a result, the nation needs to train highly skilled technicians who can program, use, maintain, and repair intelligent industrial robots. This collaborative project will address the nation?s shortfall of qualified technicians in intelligent industrial robotics.  It intends to do so by establishing a collaboration between academic institutions and major manufacturers in the eastern and central regions of Tennessee and Alabama. Together these partners will define the necessary skillset for the next-generation industrial robotics technical workforce.  They will also develop a curriculum that will allow students to learn those skills. This project will result in one of the first programs in the nation for workforce training in intelligent robotics and artificial intelligence technologies.  This effort will thus support U.S. businesses and industries to rapidly and effectively incorporate next-generation robotics in their workplace.<br/><br/>The project has the following specific aims:  1) develop intelligent robotics curricular modules; 2) implement train-the-trainer workshops for educators; 3) identify skill sets needed for handling the next-generation robotics; 4) develop a knowledge base of next-generation robotics for secondary and post-secondary educators; and 5) increase public awareness of next-generation robotics.  By using a collaboration among four academic institutions in the eastern and central regions of Tennessee and Alabama, and involving major manufacturers in the region, the project expects to deliver outcomes that will be sustainable and can be replicated or adapted at other institutions.  This project intends to develop one of the first programs in the nation for workforce training at community and technical colleges in intelligent robotics and artificial intelligence technologies.  Since community and technical college supply a significant percentage of the industrial workforce, this project has the potential to help U.S. businesses and industries rapidly and effectively incorporate next-generation robotics in their workplace.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using the equipment in the CIM lab, students learn how to apply                 existing state-of-the-art technology to a real life manufacturing               environment.  The project builds on an already existing automated               manufacturing cell.  Two computers and several work stations are linked         to the cell.  Students experiment with all processes in the                     manufacturing cycle - production forecasting through design,                    manufacturing and shipping.  The unique aspect of this facility is that         students interact with a common data base to coordinate all production          processes using real machine tools.
