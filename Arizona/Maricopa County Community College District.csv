The project is designed to 1) create an interest in engineering among students at the community colleges; 2) help students to transfer smoothly from a community college <br/>in MCCD to a four-year engineering degree program at ASU; and 3) assist the students in persisting to earn an undergraduate degree in engineering. The lead institution is the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at ASU. Four of MCCD's 10 institutions are participating: Chandler-Gilbert, Estrella Mountain, Glendale, and Mesa.  <br/> <br/>The target population is approximately 10,000 students enrolled in MCCD courses in calculus/pre-calculus, biology, chemistry, physics, and geology. The project aims to increase by 30% the number of women and underrepresented minorities who transfer into CEAS engineering programs and to retain 75% of those students in the first year and to graduation. <br/> <br/>The research-grounded project activities were designed based on analysis of best practices piloted over many years at both MCCD and ASU.  Three especially innovative features of METS are 1) research to determine which interventions and support programs are the most effective for students transitioning from a community college to a university engineering program  2) tactics to strengthen and institutionalize new collaborations between MCCD and ASU and 3) modules of Web-accessible problem-centered learning <br/>activities designed to interest community college students in engineering (especially women and underrepresented minority students) and fill the curricular gap that exists in hands-on engineering courses at the two-year level. <br/> <br/>The intellectual merit of METS is that it will yield data to enlarge the research understanding of 1) which interventions are most effective in recruiting and retaining women and minority students in engineering programs and 2) the extent to which college/university collaborations impact those efforts.  <br/> <br/>The broader impact of METS will occur in 1) developing a model of collaboration for STEM recruitment/retention between community colleges and universities, a model that can be replicated and adapted nationwide by educational institutions; and 2) disseminating Web-accessible, problem-centered engineering modules tailored to the cultural needs and learning styles of women and underrepresented minorities.<br/>"

Noyce funds are used to provide stipends to forty STEM professionals as they transition into teaching careers in grades 7-12 mathematics and/or science classrooms in high-needs school districts in Arizona.  Through the proposed hybrid format of the SMILE program, which incorporates online courses with onsite practicum and student teaching, the number and quality of mathematics and science teachers available to high-needs school districts in Arizona is being increased. <br/><br/>The SMILE program is based on Rio Salado College's Post-Baccalaureate Teacher Preparation Program, a one-year program designed to develop and certify new teachers who have a four-year degree in a non-education field. Online courses incorporate Arizona's teacher certification requirements in curriculum that offers the knowledge and essential skills participants need to become highly effective teachers.  Onsite practicum and student teaching experiences provide opportunities to observe master teachers in the classroom and practice teaching in a monitored and mentored environment. This combination of approaches provides STEM professionals flexibility in completing courses and allows the program to recruit SMILE Scholars statewide. Under the SMILE program, courses in methods and curriculum development are enhanced to incorporate mathematics and science content based on state standards. Master Teacher Seminars, designed specifically for the SMILE program, provide insight into methods, content, and resources useful in mathematics and science classrooms. SMILE Scholars receive additional development and support throughout the preparation program and while completing the required teaching commitment.  SMILE Scholars are supported through professional development opportunities which integrate teaching materials, online resources, and training programs developed by three local NSF-funded centers that provide resources for STEM education. The program also incorporates post-graduation mentoring to improve the quality and retention of SMILE Scholars in the classroom. <br/><br/>Integrated course enhancements, archived Master Teacher Seminars, and professional development opportunities created through the SMILE program become part of Rio Salado College's teacher preparation program and therefore are useful to future candidates.  The SMILE program offers its Scholars opportunities to receive training and experience with online teaching, thus building capacity within the teacher education program and within the workforce to meet the recent call for online high schools in each Arizona school district. In particular, the SMILE program's emphasis on mathematics and science teachers promotes the development of specific content and practicum experiences in this online teaching track to address the challenges of teaching STEM content online. <br/><br/>In addition to recruiting, developing, and supporting forty STEM professionals to become highly qualified mathematics and science teachers, the SMILE Scholars program provides an opportunity to identify factors that affect recruitment of STEM professionals into the teaching profession; identify program activities that are particularly helpful in producing competent, confident teachers; and identify conditions that promote retention of effective mathematics and science teachers in teaching careers. The SMILE dissemination plan specifically targets community colleges and alternative certification programs that have traditionally been underutilized in preparing mathematics and science teachers."

The performing unit is the National Center for Teacher Education (NCTE), a permanent part of the Maricopa County Community Colleges District in Arizona. NCTE is partnering with the Maricopa Advanced Technology Education Center (MATEC), Maricopa Center for Learning and Instruction (MCLI), and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE). ST4 is providing workshops and blended, online training for secondary STEM teachers and students in four Arizona Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs: bioscience, engineering, information technologies, and agriscience. Teachers and ""student leaders"" from these programs are receiving direct training, then implementing the ICT tools and collaborative learning methods in their courses. The innovative and transformative elements of this project lie in the incorporation of ICT training, design-based learning, and student participation in teacher professional development. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Secondary students are prepared for college and the workforce only if they can use the technologies that are critical to learning, collaboration, and professional work. Yet, schools have failed to harness the full power of ICT and pre-existing motivation and skills many young adults possess relative to ICT. Students tend to be less apprehensive about adopting new ICT tools than their teachers, and many have become highly skilled in using ICT to enhance their communications, expand their entertainment options, and increase their ability to interact socially. In this project, these conditions are being leveraged by (1) training students to use ICT to collaboratively learn and apply STEM knowledge and skills, and (2) enabling students to help their teachers become more confident and competent ICT users. The ST4 project is designed to tap these two potentials. A research component is embedded in the project to identify pre-existing student motivation, ICT abilities, and behaviors that can be further leveraged to improve STEM learning. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: ST4 aims to train 40 STEM teachers and 200 ""student leaders"" in an extensive series of face-to-face and online training events.

This combination is establishing a strong foundational STEM educational program that improves the quality of student preparedness for industry and four-year degree programs. Specifically, the objectives are: <br/>1. To bridge chemistry and biotechnology curricula by creating courses that focus on parallel instrumentation, other laboratory technical skills, and pedagogical changes that include hands-on use of the instrumentation. <br/>2. To immerse community college students in the university research environment by leveraging GCC's partnership with ASU West. This partnership provides students with a clear route for entry into four-year degree programs and is expected to increase the future success of the students in the pursuit and attainment of advanced degrees. <br/>3. To create an assessment loop that focuses on the links between student success and the exposure of students to instrumentation and to revised instructional pedagogy. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit.  Because of the small class size and high faculty to student ratio, GCC is an ideal setting in which to maximize student exposure to hands-on, active-participation strategies in the learning process, and to assess pedagogical techniques. GCC students are gaining from valuable and extensive experience on both academic and research grade instrumentation using up-to-date pedagogical techniques. They also are given opportunities for professional development through a unique program that exposes them to the ASU West research environment, research dissemination, and potential academic, government and industry careers. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts.  GCC is one of ten community colleges in the Maricopa County Community College District (MCCD), one of the largest community college districts in the world. The GCC student population is highly diverse with 33% (of which 24.9% are Hispanic) of the students being members of groups underrepresented in STEM fields. Thus, the project is serving underrepresented groups including those from low socioeconomic backgrounds and first-generation college students.  The alliance with ASU West is creating a pipeline for GCC students to enter STEM fields, and is preparing them for baccalaureate and graduate studies.  The project serves as a national model of using complementary instruments to develop a synergistic and transformative partnership between a Community College and a University. <br/><br/>A rigorous evaluative program is documenting student understanding of instrumentation when integrated with hands-on pedagogy as well as attitude changes as a result of this project. The faculty involved will disseminate the results of the project through publications in relevant peer-reviewed journals and by presentations at appropriate conferences. They also are conducting workshops with the intent of aggressively encouraging adoption of this project at other MCCCD colleges, especially those already equipped with an NMR instrument."

Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims. This project at the Phoenix College will advance the aims of the HSI Program by incorporating multi-disciplinary Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) into STEM curricula in colleges throughout the district. The program will develop CUREs for three targeted audiences. For non-science majors, it will develop a community-based CURE model designed to promote science literacy, positive attitudes toward science, and recruitment of students into STEM majors. For STEM majors, it will develop a CURE model designed to increase retention, transfer and degree completion of STEM majors.  For future STEM professionals, it will develop a workforce CURE model designed to improve workforce-related skills and interest in STEM careers. The program is expected to involve more than 3000 community college students. <br/><br/>The specific goals of this project are to 1) promote increased interest in STEM disciplines, especially among students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM; 2) increase recruitment and retention of students in introductory STEM courses; 3) increase the number of students from two-year HSIs who transfer into STEM degree programs at four-year institutions; and 4) establish cross-sector partnerships with industry to improve workforce readiness and promote interest in STEM careers among two-year HSI students.  The project has constructed a comprehensive plan for developing, implementing, and assessing CUREs in introductory courses at two- and four-year institutions. The program will train and mentor community college faculty in the process of developing multidisciplinary CURE modules that address research questions relevant to university researchers, industry partners, and the local community. Identification of the unique barriers and best practices associated with the implementation of CUREs at two-year HSIs will be a useful resource for other two-year and four-year institutions, including two-year HSIs that want to increase the transfer success of students from two-year to four-year programs. Knowledge generated from this project will be shared within the Maricopa County Community College District system, and distributed to the larger educational community through local, regional, and national publications and conferences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program consists of two integral components --- a two-week preparatory module for students from the Maricopa County Community College District, followed by an eight-week research experience for all participants. The preparatory module will expose students to mathematical topics that are not covered in a typical community college curriculum, including a mix of interesting ""real world"" problems and an introduction to numerical computations, which the students will then use during the research period. Following the two-week course module, students will work in small groups of 3-4 on problems suggested by mentors, in areas of interesting overlap across research groups. Participating students will learn applied mathematical concepts and numerical tools that model space- and time-dependent dynamical processes. They will also be exposed to enrichment activities including relevant research seminars and workshops on STEM opportunities and career services. <br/><br/>The overall goal of the REU program is to expand research opportunities for place-bound community college and liberal arts college students; engage community college students to matriculate into Baccalaureate programs; guide students in scholarship and graduate school applications; and establish a supporting network to assist students throughout their undergraduate programs. To realize these goals, the curriculum is designed to provide opportunities to undergraduate mathematics and science majors to work as part of a team on an interdisciplinary problem; read journal articles to gain some background on a new subject quickly; analyze open-ended problems using computer simulation as a discovery tool; and present a talk on their work at the end of the program and (optionally) at an appropriate research conference. Students are also encouraged to continue collaboration with mentors remotely, leading to publications in archival journals. The summer research will address problems related to weather prediction, atmospheric dynamics, aviation hazard analyses and forecasting; image processing and Fourier analysis; network dynamics and topology; and mathematical models of cancer (especially brain and prostate cancer). Students will be supervised by experienced faculty in their respective fields. By reaching out to community colleges, the program will tap into diverse talents from underrepresented minority groups and increase their research participation in mathematics and STEM fields. Special efforts will be made to recruit students who are first-generation college students as well as students who are female and/or members of underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences.

This work is guided by instructional standards called IMPACT: Improving Mathematical Prowess And College Teaching.  The IMPACT standards were developed by the American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges to guide transformation of mathematics instruction at two-year colleges.  The standards are intended to promote outcomes such as improving students? mathematical thinking and increasing instructors? attention to equitable and inclusive practices. This project will convene IMPACT teams from eight community colleges.  Each IMPACT team will include faculty, administrators, and support services staff.  These teams will work toward transforming their departments and departmental culture, with the overall goal of increasing active learning in college level mathematics. This collaborative effort has the potential to increase understanding about how sustained faculty development and participation in a researcher-practitioner partnership affects student success rates and retention in community college mathematics. The project can also contribute to understanding how active learning improves students? engagement, knowledge, and skills.<br/><br/>This collaborative project involves partnerships between the American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges, and Chandler-Gilbert Community College, Clackamas Community College, and Oregon State University. The five-year project aims to increase student success rates in gateway and prerequisite mathematics courses through focus on three key activities: (1) development of faculty content and pedagogical knowledge; (2) building of community engagement through AMATYC?s community portal; and (3) investigating the effects of project interventions on student success. Results of these activities will contribute to the project's focus on students and instruction, departments and institutions, and knowledge generation specifically within the context of community college mathematics. Research findings are expected to lead to a framework for systemic transformation of community college mathematics departments. The project's research efforts will be guided by design-based implementation research and will facilitate researcher-practitioner partnerships that support faculty in developing a research perspective to inform their teaching.  The project aims to provide new knowledge about: 1) how instructors? enactment of active learning supports student learning; 2) and how an IMPACT team?s participation in researcher-practitioner partnerships and in communities of transformation lead to department-level change to support student success; and (3) how a professional organization plays a role in convening a community of transformation of mathematics departments and propagating a model of this transformation. A retrospective analysis of data across the project's participating colleges will result in a contextualized theory of change framework for community college mathematics departments. The NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Education and Human Resources program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Institutional and Community Transformation track, the program supports efforts to transform and improve STEM education across institutions of higher education and disciplinary communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is a growing national interest in the role of community colleges for undergraduate education. The proposal seeks to investigate the conditions under which instruction in community college algebra courses can be associated with student learning gains and course performance. This information can be used to design programs to improve instruction and to support student success in algebra. The study involves six community colleges from three states and focuses on three key algebra topics: linear equations, rational equations, and exponential equations. The results will also have applications for mathematics courses at other institutions of higher education. This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. <br/><br/>The project will connect both levels of the classroom (students and instructors) in a model that examines personal characteristics of both groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, educational background, student mathematics knowledge, and beliefs about mathematics) and aspects of classroom interaction (e.g., quality of mathematics, quality of instruction). The institutions represent urban, suburban, and rural communities, a range of institution sizes, and three different regions of the United States. A model is proposed for examining these related variables to examine what relationships exist. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected in a mixed methods design in multiple project phases. The first phase will include pilot testing some of the instruments for the project and testing the models. Later phases include data collection and analysis across the institutions. Data collection includes student-level and instructor-level measures. For students, the project will examine measures of mathematics performance, mathematics beliefs, and perceptions of the classroom environment. For instructors, the project will examine knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes. Demographic information will be collected for all participants. In addition to the quantitative measures, classroom observations and video analysis will be used to document the nature of instruction."

The project is based at the Maricopa Skill Center, located in a low-income neighborhood of Phoenix, Arizona, and targets underserved minorities and women. The program's instructional plan includes 12 multimedia learning modules targeted to the National Skill Standards for Technicians in Highly Automated Manufacturing; hands-on laboratory activities using an innovative, industry-subsidized simulator; intensive student mentoring for college and job options; and an individualized education/employment plan for each student. The project also offers faculty development for some 126 community college and high school instructors and is holding two national demonstrations for college deans/department heads and industry trainers. The teaching core of the Factory Wise project is a realistic simulation of a highly automated manufacturing environment that the partners are creating in Skill Center laboratories. The simulation uses the HAS (Highly Automated System)-200 training system recently developed in collaboration with industry and with support from the Intel Corp. Faculty coach students in working with HAS-200 and Factory Wise materials to learn the concepts, skills, and attitudes they need to succeed in an AAS-degree path or entry-level work in industry. The modules are adaptable to instruction with the full HAS-200, with selected stations of it, or without it. The intellectual merit of the project lies in testing the proposition that close mentoring in a highly interactive learning environment can motivate academically challenged students to choose STEM pathways leading to well-paid manufacturing jobs. The project impacts broadly beyond Arizona by a) leveraging MATEC's curriculum development expertise to provide modules and learning activities to collaborating educational institutions; and b) disseminating an efficient learning and program building model (adaptable for use with and without the trainer, in industries from pharmaceuticals to semiconductors) for motivating difficult-to-reach students to pursue degrees and careers in advanced manufacturing."

The project's overall goal is to improve student success through increased faculty use of methods, which link science courses through real-life applications. The major activity is the adaptation of content to create 20 interdisciplinary modules for science courses. Implementation of these modules is being accomplished through the Management Team (MT) whose members are the PI, Co-Pls, and nine science faculty who serve as Peer Mentors (PM) at the individual colleges. Activities are being implemented to support integration and use of the interdisciplinary modules through faculty workshops and seminars. This includes an annual 1-2 day workshop on implementing active learning in science classrooms, and the establishment of Collaborative Learning Teams (CLT) of science faculty at each college who are working together with PMs to implement interdisciplinary modules and active learning in science classrooms. Outcome objectives include: 1) increasing, by 75 % over the baseline year, the number of full-time science faculty who use approaches aligned with systemic reform and 2) bringing the overall proportion of full-time science faculty who routinely use new approaches to 50% (50 faculty of 100). This project will be guided by using the adaptation and implementation of best practice examples, many generated by NSF sponsored projects, which foster the promotion of critical thinking, problem-solving skills and creativity/collaborative learning and which are interdisciplinary/contextually relevant.  Major evaluation activities are: 1) regular monitoring by the MT; 2) pilot-testing of modules; 3) and pre-post evaluation design to measure implementation levels. Following preparation of a Final Evaluation Report, project processes/outcomes and interdisciplinary modules are being disseminated through the Project's website and through presentations at selected regional and national conferences.  Other plans include the generation of a multimedia CD-ROM, the dissemination of videotapes of the workshops and publications in relevant professional journals.

These institutions include large research universities, comprehensive universities, small liberal arts colleges and two-year community colleges. GARNET - the Geoscience Affective Research NETwork - is promoting excellence in STEM teaching and learning by examining how students' learning is influenced by their ""affective characteristics"" (motivation, attitudes, values, beliefs, etc.) and by pedagogical strategies designed to help support student learning and interest in the content. GARNET is helping to fill a little studied, yet highly significant gap in our understanding of student learning of science, by asking ""how do students' motivations and beliefs about their learning skills influence their understanding of course content?""  This project is integrating research and education by providing fundamental data about the role of the affective domain in learning, while simultaneously helping students develop better learning skills. The project is building on the results of a previous collaborative GARNET project that tested two key hypotheses: (1) the affective domain has a major influence on student learning; and (2) different teaching methods significantly influence student affect and, consequently, learning. Results of that previous project revealed that learning beliefs, such as self-efficacy, were related to student performance but that the use of different instructional strategies had minimal impact on students' affective constructs. This project is moving the original GARNET focus away from what instructors do to improve learning, to study ""what students do"" to modify their own affect and improve their abilities to learn. The affective domain is linked to a four-stage self-regulated learning cycle that instructors are using to train students to monitor and regulate their affective constructs, and are measuring and evaluating the associated impact on student learning. On the basis of such findings, the project is developing affect-based pedagogical resources and strategies that will allow instructors to develop better introductory geoscience classes and improve student engagement, attitude, and ultimately, learning across a variety of STEM fields."

To strengthen the capacity of faculty to serve all students, including Hispanic students, the project will provide faculty with professional development focused on equity mindset. The framework to provide mentored work experiences will be developed and piloted at Phoenix College, then expanded to four other two-year HSIs in the region. The project also intends to expand this framework to other STEM fields.  Through this work, the project aims to develop a replicable model for how two-year institutions can develop work experiences that foster increased student graduation and entry into STEM career pathways.<br/><br/>This project seeks to examine how a curriculum that integrates cross-sector partnerships to provide work experiences can enhance STEM learning and retention.  Using mixed methods and grounded theory, this project will expand knowledge about: (1) the impact of cross-sector partnerships that support work-focused experiential teaching and learning; (2) systematic ways to maintain and better use cross-sector partnerships; and (3) the degree to which a model of work-focused learning experiences can be adopted at other two-year HSIs and by other STEM fields. Expected results of the project include: development of sustainable mechanisms to foster cross-sector partnerships; increased student retention and workforce readiness; and measurable successes for STEM students, particularly Hispanic students, at two-year HSIs. Significant findings and research results will be presented at meetings of the HSI STEM Hub, at conferences at professional societies that support HSIs, and in academic publications. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge about how to achieve these aims.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project established a permanent industry and education working group the Emerging Electronics Curriculum Task Force (EECTF) to monitor and advise the project on industry advances in electronics. Under the guidance of that task force, the project is develops, pilot testing, and disseminating the first 25 modules in a new electronic library of classroom-ready materials for teaching updated electronics technology.  The modules take a hybrid Web-and CD-ROM-delivered format developed by MATEC under a previous NSF grant.  The intended users of the modules are ultimately faculty who teach in approximately 1,000 two-year degree programs. During the 36 months of the project, MATEC is establishing the EECTF, developing 25 modules, field testing the modules with at least 100 students in three locations, and achieving adoption of the modules by faculty in 30% of targeted programs. Beyond the grant period the EECTF will continue to assist MATEC in a continuous updating of the modules. The modules are an instructional resource that faculty can integrate with any commercially available textbook. <br/><br/>The principal intellectual merit of Work-Ready Electronics is that the project addresses a fundamental challenge facing technician education. That is it attempts to close gaps that exist between electronics teaching materials and workplace requirements. MATEC made a preliminary identification of those gaps by 1) conducting a literature review of the textbooks assigned in 90% of two-year electronics programs and 2) surveying 10 major electronics companies and manufacturers. Project leaders have relevant experience in both the electronics industry and education. MATEC is the NSF's National Center of Excellence for Education in Semiconductor Manufacturing. Industry partners are the American Electronics Association, the Technician Performance Improvement Council of Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI), and 10 companies. <br/><br/>The project attains a number of broader impacts through the following: 1) Industry's willingness to partner in the project, which suggests that Work-Ready Electronics addresses industry's need for technicians whose preparation is better targeted to the workplace; 2) The modernizing of electronics curriculum at any 2-year college by continuously providing modules of industry electronic updates; and 3) The pedagogical preparation of STEM faculty and high school teachers through regional workshops.

Various support services and associated student activities are enhancing the academic experience of the scholarship recipients. The project has identified a specific opportunity to prepare students to meet the demands of the high technology industries in its region. Thus it features strong interactions with companies in the area that offer internship and mentoring opportunities for the scholars. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its leveraging of prior successful projects that offer existing student support structures that help to promote academic quality in the targeted STEM disciplines. The project's broader impacts are felt through activities such as field trips and participation in professional societies, that supplement the students' regular classroom interactions so as to maintain their interest in the STEM disciplines. The project also is striving to award forty percent of its scholarships to groups traditionally underrepresented in the STEM disciplines so as to promote a more diverse workforce. In the long term the project is benefiting society by increasing the number of highly skilled, well-educated members in the high-tech workforce."
