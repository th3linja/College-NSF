The college is well underway toward completing its ADA self-evaluation goals for physical barrier removal. A corresponding effort, however, has not taken place to address access to instructional materials in appropriate forms, educational technology, alternative delivery methodologies and access to laboratory and field experiences.<br/> <br/>The goal of this project is to increase the number of rural disabled students successfully pursuing SMET careers.  An advisory committee will provide oversight and project direction to actualize the following objective: To develop a model program that creates an inviting rural community college environment responsive to the needs of students with disabilities.  The Open Door Project will: 1.  Assign a SMET disabilities curriculum coordinator to research, gather, and maintain a specific set of alternative curricular materials and strategies for all gateway math and science courses that use current best practices of adaptation, accommodation, and assistive technology.  2.  Train disabilities Master Teachers in all SMET curricular areas who will conduct disabilities awareness and alternative strategies training at the SMET department level.  The problem of adjunct faculty inclusion will be addressed by specific training at orientation, access to intranet resources, and assignment of a disabilities mentor from the full-time SMET faculty.  3.  Develop ways for students to have a SMET ""hands-on"" experience by creating innovative ways to assimilate students with disabilities into ongoing research, field and laboratory activities and to facilitate student interface with working SMET professionals in local and regional high tech businesses.  This activity will include development of a SMET Summer Camp for students with disabilities.<br/><br/>The Open Door Project will also work to increase the number of disabled high school students, veterans, women re-entering the workforce and Native Americans with SMET career expectations.  This will be accomplished by using the countywide outreach activity of existing TRIO and Transition programs to encourage interest in SMET careers among disabled students.  In addition, these outreach groups, staff development activities, and stipends for participation in summer programs, will be used to raise the awareness of high school and college career counselors and faculty.  This will increase their competency to address the needs of students with disabilities and promote existing Yavapai College Foundation scholarships for disabled and SMET students as well as SMET summer camps.<br/><br/>The Open Door Capacity Building Project will raise the visibility and attractiveness of SMET careers for disabled students by creating a program specifically designed to capture their imaginations and provide a responsive community college experience that articulates into a SMET career or advanced degree.  The long-range post-project goal is to use Yavapai College's unique field sites and on-campus dorm capacity to create a regional SMET magnet school for students with disabilities.<br/>"

As a result of the project, the first Associate of Applied Science (AAS) in Viticulture and Enology degree program in Arizona is being created. Three partner high schools are delivering viticulture courses onsite, providing opportunities for high school students to earn up to 12 college credits while still in high school. The learning environment is being revitalized through the use of teaching laboratories that provide real world, experiential education. Vineyards, including a one acre plot at the college and three 1/3 acre plots at partner high schools, serve as teaching laboratories. A Enology Laboratory is available to students to conduct wine testing and experimentation. The success of the program is being determined by evaluating progress toward meeting measurable objectives related to enrollment; retention; student success (measured by student learning outcomes); and changes in knowledge experienced by high school and post-secondary teachers after training.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project is advancing knowledge and understanding about growing techniques that contribute to successful grape growing in the high desert regions of the Southwest United States. This knowledge contributes to the overall understanding of sustainable agriculture and natural resource conservation specific to this ecosystem. Development of curriculum, designed to utilize multiple modalities, provides quality teaching materials for use throughout the region. Community college faculty and high school agriscience instructors from around Arizona gain new knowledge about viticulture and enology and industry practices that result in improved teaching practices across the state. Internships and trainings that increase the technical knowledge and skills of secondary and post-secondary agriscience teachers are also provided.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project exposes high school students, through dual enrollment, to college-level agricultural science classes because early exposure to college-level courses is known to increase high school graduation and college enrollment. The project thus creates a career pathway that is resulting in more rural students becoming trained in agriscience technology. The curriculum, enology laboratory, and on-campus vineyards provide the college and partner high schools with resources that are useful across multiple disciplines in food and agricultural sciences and thus enhance science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education for many students. The Viticulture and Enology program is responsive to the needs of a new, emerging regional industry in the region. Students gain skills needed to successfully compete for employment, while providing a well trained workforce to the industry. Furthermore, the project is a foundational piece in the creation of the larger Southwest Wine Center, and therefore, leverages the knowledge discovery, information-sharing, industry collaboration, job creation, and economic growth for wine making in Arizona and the entire Southwest region."

As indicated by the project title, the focus will be on improving opportunities for students in rural Arizona communities.  A new pathway leading to certification as an Integrated Systems Engineering Technician will be incorporated into an existing Applied Pre-engineering Program. The new pathway will help students gain a deeper understanding of complex systems and how they are connected and work together. The introduction of problem-based learning (PBL) pedagogy will help students connect diverse knowledge from multiple courses to solve real-world challenges.  New internship opportunities will give students exposure to the actual work environment. Nine stackable industry-recognized credentials, three certificates and two Associates Degrees will give students options for employment in middle skills jobs or additional postsecondary education.  Outreach events targeting rural high school students will be expanded and a summer Robotics Camp for middle school girls will be instituted with the aim of increasing enrollment of female students in the program. A marketing campaign will improve parents', teachers' and students' access to information about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers and training programs. The improved Applied Pre-engineering Program, which will include an early college program for high school students, will incorporate best practice student support strategies, such as on-site tutoring and expanded access to applied learning using modern equipment.  The actions to be undertaken in this project were determined as a result of a preliminary assessment of the YC Applied Pre-engineering Program that was developed and implemented based upon the STEM Pathways Guide, which was developed by Science Foundation Arizona (SFAz).<br/><br/>The overarching goals of the Engineered for Success: Engineering Technician Training for Rural Arizona project are to: 1) produce more qualified engineering technicians to meet workforce demands, and 2) improve engineering technician education.  Strategies for accomplishing these broad goals include, but are not limited to, assuring technician training meets industry needs by engaging an Industry Advisory Council, increasing enrollment and course capacity, raising awareness and interest through targeted outreach efforts, and improving teaching to more strongly demonstrate relevance and practical industry applications.  Attainment of anticipated outcomes will be assessed using institutional data to measure quantitative impacts of the project (e.g. enrollment, degrees/certificates completed, demographic changes, etc.) and surveys to gauge  qualitative impacts (e.g. changes in teaching practices, student attitudes/perceptions).  As a member of Science Foundation Arizona's STEM Pathways Network, YC will seek to demonstrate the applicability of and expand knowledge about the organization's STEM Pathways Model through this project."
