A series of signs with informational artwork depicts each geologic period and complements and completes an existing educational display. This display educates the public about the geology of Mohave County, which includes the stratigraphy of the Grand Canyon and Zion National Parks. <br/> This project provides members of the community with a scientific and structured understanding of their geologic environment. It also provides an educational resource for students as they study the local geology in relation to geologic time. The geologic timeline, in conjunction with the educational boulder display, concentrates in one place a wide variety of geological wonders that are scattered throughout Mohave County. Viewers of the timeline experience geological detail up-close and can appreciate the relationship among Earth's development, geologic events, and history of life. <br/>Mohave Community College is partnering with a local school district, a charter high school, and a local gem and mineral club. This project is designed to instill in the public, faculty, and students of the partner schools, an enduring interest in the study and appreciation of the geosciences."

The program will provide scholarships for talented, low-income students with demonstrated financial need who are pursuing degrees in engineering or computer science. In addition to scholarships, the program will provide academic and other support to increase the persistence of these academically talented, low-income students.  The project design includes an academic success and professional development course along with project-based activities.  Faculty and industrial mentors help students to envision the potential career opportunities and benefits available in engineering and computer science. Nine of the ten collaborating schools are classified as Hispanic Serving Institutions. Scholarships and support for low-income and academically talented students, who may not otherwise be able to obtain engineering or computer science degrees will help to produce a well-trained workforce that will contribute to the economic well being of the nation.<br/><br/>The project seeks to address the need to expand the engineering and computer science workforce by increasing the success of Arizona State University students including students that transfer from community colleges. The program combines a network of engineering mentors with a successful student-centered and mentor-driven academic success and professional development course to significantly increase the number of community college students that consider, choose, continue and graduate with a bachelor of science in engineering or computer science.  At the center of the proposed initiative is a commitment to involving students in career-shaping projects that will permit them to discover, nurture, and fully develop their technical interests. Guided by grounded theory and social cognitive career theory, the project will also study the factors most central to maintaining effectiveness while scaling up a successful student-centered and mentor-intensive transfer student support system to encompass a larger group of collaborating institutions. Community colleges will play an increasingly important role in educating the nation's engineers. This statewide project will serve as a collaborative model for four-year and two-year schools across the nation. This research will provide knowledge helpful in establishing a transfer student support program in Arizona and will inform other university and community college networks in other parts of the United States. The findings from the program will be disseminated widely to the engineering and computer science education community."

The team is working to significantly increase the number of transfer students, especially women and underrepresented minority students, that graduate in engineering and computer science. In order to accomplish this, they are: 1) providing scholarships to students in the feeder schools and to transfer students at Arizona State University , 2) supporting student outreach activities at the feeder schools, 3) supporting engineering courses at the feeder schools by providing materials, tutoring, local engineering speakers, and tuition scholarships, 4) conducting ""Be an Engineer"" events at the feeder schools for both students and their parents, 5) providing classes, workshops, and seminars using live broadcast and videotape, 6) providing an engaged community of mentors with extensive experience and commitment for all students, 7) hosting an orientation at Arizona State University for engineering transfer students, 8) managing a center where engineering transfer students can study together and get the support needed to survive, and 9) working with transfer students through a time-tested ""career shaping"" academic scholarship workshop program. The project is building on an earlier successful program between Arizona State University and a set of metropolitan community colleges with similar goals. Evaluation efforts, involving formative and summative aspects, are being conducted by internal and external evaluators who are developing and monitoring indices for enrollment, persistence, and graduation. Broader impacts include the development and dissemination of models for collaboration between community colleges and four-year schools and the efforts to increase the number of women and minorities in engineering."

The new equipment being incorporated into the teaching program includes plant growth chambers, marine aquaria and computer-interfaced physiology instrumentation. The environmental chambers enhance the school's ability to conduct General Biology laboratory experiments involving plant competition and animal metabolism. The salt-water aquaria are used to expose General Biology students (most of whom are completely unfamiliar with the ocean) to marine invertebrates. The computer-interfaced physiology instrumenta- tion vastly improves second-year students' opportunities to collect data that quantify the adaptive responses of animals to varying stimuli. The importance of this instrumentation is that its use in undergraduate laboratory instruction provides more effective teaching of scientific methods for understanding the environment. A practical grasp of how scientific methods are used by investigators is important for both science and non-science majors, and environmental topics hold a special interest for this audience. The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources."
