This planning grant will provide a springboard toward a larger grant for an Enterprise Advancement Center (TEA), a program offered by the Tribal Colleges and University Partnership Program at the National Science Foundation. This project is consistent with the goals of the Native American Languages Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990, which enacted into policy the recognition of the unique status and importance of Native American languages. This center would serve the Tohono O'odham Nation as a clearing house for information about the Tohono O'odham language, an endangered Indigenous language spoken on both sides of the Arizona / Mexico border. The center will provide a support for teachers and students throughout the speaking community and a site for continued documentation and development of material resources for those seeking to teach or learn the language and / or for those with research interests related to the Tohono O'odham. Broader impacts also include the potential to enhance economic activity for a tribal nation, and to broaden participation for Native Americans, who are underrepresented in all the sciences, including linguistics.<br/><br/><br/>When completed, the Tohono O'odham Language Center will provide a hub for all intellectual activity related to addressing the endangered status of the Tohono O'odham language. This includes building the capacity of students at TOCC and language workers throughout the community through training in language recording, language data management, language archiving, and in language-processing technology appropriate for community use in both language documentation and language teaching. There is also intellectual merit in the securing of appropriate academic resources and archival materials needed to support these activities. A center of this type will have language and language-related activities at its core, but will also be a center for community networking and media outreach. The broader impacts will ripple throughout the tribal college system at all levels, throughout the Tohono O'odham community and its related tribes, throughout other Indigenous communities in Arizona and around North America. Other stakeholders within Arizona Universities and state colleges, in tribal government and other entities charged with ensuring a future for Indigenous languages, will notice and feel the effects of centralizing language work for the betterment of all. Such a center is truly transformative and the vision is very much geared toward creating a replicable model, complete with state-of-the-art equipment and methods. There will be wide-ranging publicity from the planning stages onward as the research team gathers and shares information about the literal construction and the growing list of resources that will be included.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Expanding the research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal, allowing the institution?s faculty and administrators to design and develop a comprehensive plan for improving and expanding STEM instruction.<br/><br/><br/>Tohono O'odham Community College will conduct an institutional assessment of its STEM programs and create a strategic plan for increasing its STEM capacity. Workshops that include TOCC faculty and administration, TOCC students, Tohono O'odham Nation departments, stakeholders and external educational institutions will formulate a shared vision of what STEM capacity should be at TOCC and how to achieve it. The results of the assessment will constitute the baseline for the elaboration of a STEM Capacity-building plan and NSF TCUP STEM Instructional Capacity Excellence proposal for 2017. The plan will include a systemic, comprehensive approach to integrating our curriculum into the Tohono O'odham way of life (Himdag) through the application of an indigenous education model. This plan will also include innovative educational strategies such as the creation of learning communities focused on integrative and problem-based learning."

The ""Pathways to Indigenous STEM (Ma:cidag wo:g STEM Wui)"" project at Tohono O'odham Community College (TOCC) directly addresses these goals by increasing the number and diversifying the delivery mode of STEM courses and strengthening the academic support for students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings and improving the academic environment to better meet the needs of Native students encourages students to pursue challenging and rewarding STEM degrees and careers, thus diversifying the nation's workforce and contributing to our country's prosperity and security. The knowledge gained from studying the efficacy of the project will contribute to our understanding of best practices for recruiting and retaining underrepresented students in STEM and preparing the next generation of STEM professionals.<br/><br/>The ""Man in the Maze Education Model"" (MiME) developed at TOCC will serve as a culturally-based framework for curriculum development and program assessment and will provide an intentional and systematic approach to Indigenizing TOCC's STEM curriculum and programs. The project will realize these goals by focusing on four objectives: (1) Application of a culturally responsive education model that integrates STEM disciplines in a culturally-responsive manner, (2) increasing the number of curricular offerings in the Physical Sciences and online STEM courses, (3) promotion of the professional preparedness of students by engaging them in internships and research experiences, and (4) increased support for transitioning students from high school to TOCC and TOCC to other colleges. This project will result in an assessment and design for STEM instructional improvement that will incorporate elements of self-determination and culturally-based education within the context of the current generation of Tohono O'odham students.  The project plan includes unique and innovative instructional strategies that are compatible with the Tohono O'odham culture with a goal of preparing students to face current and future challenges using both 21st-century knowledge and traditional knowledge.  Incorporating an Indigenous education model based on the MiME Model represents a significant contribution toward understanding how to implement and assess culturally-based education. Although the MiME Model is culturally specific to TOCC, the model's concepts for integrating STEM into a traditional cultural knowledge base can be adapted for application at tribal colleges and universities and other minority-serving institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
