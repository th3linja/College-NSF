""Shaking up the future of Hispanic students in rural southwest Ariona"" is a three-phase geoscience education program to indentify, recruit, and train talented underrepresented students in geoscience. The linchpin of the program is a local reserach-quality seismic network comprising three broadband seismometers. Yuma is situated on the east perimeter of the seismically-active Salton Trough; a transtensional basin located at the southern end of the San Andreas Transform system. Most area residents have felt earthquakes and students in geosciece classes show an interest and enthusiasm in their origin and potential societal impact. The project will recruit local minority high school students by engaging them in a topical sciecne issue that impacts border communities in Arizona and California.<br/><br/>The AWC Seismic Observatory in geoscience education is a joint effort of the Arizona Western College and the University of Arizona's Southern Arizona Seismic Observatory (SASO). Phase I of the three-phase program involves an annual 2.5 week summer seismic program where high school students and AWC geoscience majors explore the nature of earthquakes in the field and laboratory. In Phaes II, high school students will bridge up to one AWC's three geoscience programs. As part of the geoscience curriculum, students will work in the seismic observatory with a graduate student from SASO and participate in frequent regional field trips. In Phase III, student participants move to geoscience programs at the University of Arizona or other institutions. The relationships fostered in Phase I and II will serve as an academic bridge connecting AWC students to faculty in the Geoscience Department at the University of Arizona."

AWC is designated by the Department of Education as a Hispanic Serving Institution.<br/><br/>Experiments and protocols from a wide variety of sources including the research and educational literature are being combined and adapted to create the laboratory activities. In Chemistry courses, students use the UV-Vis to conduct a photoassisted reaction that mineralizes an organic dye, analyze the campus' pool's disinfectant capacity, test for lead in Mexican glazed pottery, and characterize the absorption spectra of two thermochromic compounds. Biology students are elucidating the structure-function molecular motif from the absorption spectra of plant pigments chlorophyll a and b, and anthocyanins. Students in Physics/Astronomy are studying how particulate matter preferentially scatters more energetic wavelengths and how the interaction between matter and light helps explain red-orange sunsets and sunrises, and cosmological phenomena. Environmental Science students are carrying out a temporal and spatial water quality study of the local desert watershed (Colorado River, Martinez and Mittry Lakes), and analyzing for ammonia and phosphate in both cultivated and uncultivated soils to determine the potential impact for contamination of the local groundwater supply. <br/><br/>The multidisciplinary use of the UV-Vis spectrometers: 1) allows faculty to incorporate new laboratory experiments into the curriculum and hence expand topic coverage, 2) allows faculty to teach topics that were previously relegated to lecture because of non-existent instrumentation capacity, 3) gives students hands-on experience with modern instrumentation and methodology, 4) shifts student focus more towards data analysis, and 5) creates undergraduate research opportunities for community college students. <br/><br/>The successes and challenges of implementing the spectrophotometric lab activities into the curricula will be shared with the science education community at large via journal submissions and presentations at regional and national meetings."

Several published chemistry, microbiology, environmental science, and agricultural science experiments are being adapted into the four discipline's laboratory curricula.  Chemistry students use the instrumentation to monitor the uptake of a nitrogen-based fertilizer into various vegetative and reproductive organs of wheat during seed development and to determine a product's empirical formula, its percent purity, and the efficiency of recrystallization. Agricultural Science students use the instrumentation to carry out a spatiotemporal soil C:N analysis study at various soil depths in a recently tilled but still fallow corn and alfalfa fields. They examine the fate and transport of nematicides as a function of soil depth and soil type and also study the difference in autocatalytic production rates of ethylene gas- a plant growth regulator- in various foods. Environmental Science students use the GC to measure carbon monoxide emissions from vehicle exhaust and measure the rate of production of greenhouse gases from soil. Microbiology students use the instrumentation to quantify soil microbial biomass. The multidisciplinary use of the Elemental Analyzer and GC has provided us an opportunity to incorporate new labs into the curriculum and hence expand topic coverage in the classroom. The instrumentation now allows the faculty to teach topics that were relegated to lecture because of non-existent instrumentation capacity and also gives students hands-on experience with modern instrumentation and methodology. It is anticipated that the project's emphases on the relevancy of science to everyday life, hands-on instrument experience, and using the surrounding desert environment as a laboratory provide our students a valuable laboratory experience that is consistent with current science educational trends and practices."

Faculty and students from the Departments of Chemistry, Environmental Science, and Geology along with scientists from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation will participate. The proposed laboratory projects will incorporate 20 CBL units interfaced with pH, conductivity, colorimetric, and temperature probes and 2 Macintosh computers into both the AWC General Chemistry laboratory curriculum and the AWC / NAU-Yuma Environmental Science program. The CBL is an automatic data collection device from Texas Instruments that collects and stores data in a laboratory environment. The Macintosh computers will allow for a more sophisticated, graphical and statistical analysis of the experimental data. Use of CBLs and Macintosh computers will expand the range and type of laboratory activities, shift student focus from tedious data collection to its interpretation and hence conceptual relevancy, allow faculty to teach topics previously never taught, allow students to conduct experiments that previously could not be done, and give new options for student learning and participation. The successes of the project will be shared with the Yuma County Educational Consortium, which includes AWC, NAU-Yuma, the Yuma Union High School District as well as nine public school districts the Yuma Math and Science Consortium, and regional and national Science education communities through workshops, presentations at professional meetings, and journal publications."
