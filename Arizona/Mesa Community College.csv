Inquiry-oriented laboratory instruction of nonmajor, introductory biology students to include weekly computer applications are featured. The course is based on a 3-phase sequence of instruction including exploration, term introduction, and application. Traditional hands-on exploration activities, are supplemented with computer simulations."

Specific goals are to increase scientific literacy, reasoning skills, and the number of students succeeding in introductory biology courses. Also, these goals will be achieved by developing, evaluating and integrating into the curriculum a set of computer applications designed to reinforce biology concepts with laboratory activities. Efforts will be focused on an introductory biology course at a 2-year college that serves a nontraditional undergraduate population. Student populations will include more women, Hispanics, Native Americans and older students. The resultant inquiry-based model of laboratory instruction is also expected to be used as a model for computer technology in bio- science education.***//"
