Students learn calculus in a way that easily transfers to other courses, especially laboratory sciences. This project helps more students to successfully complete calculus courses and provides a better understanding of how to change the entire before-calculus curriculum. Through this project, students are prepared to address the quantitative problems they will meet in their personal and professional lives."
