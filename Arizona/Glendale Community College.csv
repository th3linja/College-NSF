Participants are being supported via financial assistance, mentoring, advice for successful transfer to a four year university, and participation in a learning community of scholars.  The college is reaching out to groups of talented students who would otherwise not be able to, or not choose to, enter into a STEM career. The college already has considerable experience doing the type of outreach required for the program. For the past ten years Glendale Community College (GCC) has run, in collaboration with California State University, Northridge, a successful Alliance for Minority Participation (AMP) program. The college has an extensive support system to help students succeed, especially those who do not have a strong support system of their own, such as first generation college students and students from lower economic strata. The college's counseling staff is one of the largest in the state, as is the supplemental instruction program which provides collaborative learning workshops in many science and math classes. GCC has a Math/Science Center for computer work and drop-in tutoring, a regular tutoring program, and, because of the AMP experience, a mentoring program and a summer bridge program focusing on mathematics training and general college preparation. <br/><br/>Intellectual merit: The project's activities address a major challenge in recruiting students to STEM careers.  It is supported by a capable faculty and by adequate institutional facilities, resources, and commitment.  In addition there is a focus on documenting measurable improvements in student learning. <br/><br/>Broader impacts:  A replicable support system for STEM students, a model useful to other institutions, is being disseminated.  Faculty are taking specific steps to ensure that pedagogical strategies related to enhancing the success of underrepresented students are integrated into instructional approaches benefiting the college's diverse student population and broadening the successful participation of underrepresented groups in STEM-related learning.<br/>"

In response, this project is adapting Just- in- Time Teaching (JiTT) techniques originally developed for physics education for use in introductory economics courses. JiTT techniques combine the use of Web- based exercises with active- learning pedagogy to provide a dynamic learning environment that makes students collaborators in the learning process. [See Gregor Novak, E. Patterson, A. Gavrin, and W. Christian, ""Just-in-Time Teaching: Blending Active Learning with Web Technology,"" Prentice Hall, 1999.] Students complete exercises on the Web and turn them in a few hours before class; faculty then organize the classroom session around students' responses just prior to class. Excerpts from students' submissions are presented during the class as the basis for lecture topics and are also used to develop collaborative exercises that teams of students work on during classroom sessions. This two- pronged approach leads to better student preparation for class, greater participation in classroom discussion, instantaneous feedback for instructors, and improved student study habits. We are building a model for JiTT application in a traditional Principles of Economics sequence that features 25 modules of lecture/ discussion topics, warm- up exercises, economic puzzles, and collaborative in- class activities. By implementing JiTT techniques in introductory economics courses we hope to achieve four related objectives: (1) improving learning in undergraduate economics courses through increased emphasis on active- student learning activities, (2) developing effective strategies for integrating use of the Web in an active- student learning environment, (3) increasing the academic success of minority students in economics, and (4) fostering changes in teaching practices in economics. The development, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of JiTT materials for introductory economics courses is being carried out by experienced faculty members at Glendale Community College (GCC) and North Carolina A&T State University (NCAT), institutions serving unique educational missions and diverse student populations. In addition to developing JiTT materials for classroom use and testing the effectiveness of JiTT techniques in our classes, we are in the process of developing a JiTT in Economics Web site at NCAT. The Web site will eventually include a description of the JiTT strategy, links to JiTT use elsewhere, a complete compilation of the 25 modules we develop, workshop presentations, and our research findings and recommendations. To encourage broader adoption of JiTT strategies in economics, we are publicizing the materials on this Web site and presenting our findings through presentations at workshops and professional meetings, as well as through economic education listservs to which we belong."

Currently, there are few attempts in lower division physics laboratories to demonstrate any of the properties of electromagnetic waves at radio frequencies. In lower division laboratories, electromagnetic waves are presented in terms of oscillations of current and voltage in wires at audio frequencies which leaves the student with the impression that electromagnetic waves in space are a topic entirely separate from transverse mechanical waves, hidden from comprehension by a formidable mathematical formalism. Understanding the similarities of electromagnetic waves to transverse mechanical waves gives the students an appreciation of the physical basis of electrical phenomena. Concepts like impedance, reflection coefficient, and matching are seen as general properties of all transverse waves and are not unique to electromagnetic waves. Understanding the differences between electromagnetic waves and transverse mechanical waves leads the student naturally into the modern theories of electrons and relativity. The major instruments to be purchases are Wiltron Model 6409 RF Analyzer. The Wiltron Analyzer will be used to investigate. A. Electromagnetic standing waves in conductors', B. Attenuation of electromagnetic waves in systems driven beyond cut-off, C. Electromagnetic modes of vibration in cavity resonators', electromagnetic waves in space near conductors."

The goal is improved instruction for community college students, achieved through increased participation by community college instructors in two existing NSF programs for faculty development that have proven to be effective: Teaching and Learning Economics (DUE 0817382) and the Teaching Innovations Program (DUE 0338482). These programs are based on learning theory research and currently provide a total of 36 pedagogic modules, all of which use insights about the ways that students develop expert-like economics thinking. <br/><br/>In the first year, alternative choices for outreach and faculty development in the community college sector are being assessed, building on a survey that identifies relevant characteristics of community college economics instructors in four diverse community college environments. Using this knowledge, a planning workshop is planned to bring together economic educators in community colleges with experts from other STEM disciplines that have already developed programs for improved community college instruction. <br/><br/>In year two, the relative effectiveness of different workshop modalities is to be tested. These include: a traveling workshop, online workshops, and regional workshops. By design, the Science Education Resource Center (SERC) has agreed to sustain the resulting community of effective two-year college instructors in economics. A participant survey, conducted several months after the workshops, will assess the project's effectiveness. The project includes plans for ongoing formative assessment by an advisory board and summative assessment by an external evaluator."
