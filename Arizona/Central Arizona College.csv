The program will provide scholarships for talented, low-income students with demonstrated financial need who are pursuing degrees in engineering or computer science. In addition to scholarships, the program will provide academic and other support to increase the persistence of these academically talented, low-income students.  The project design includes an academic success and professional development course along with project-based activities.  Faculty and industrial mentors help students to envision the potential career opportunities and benefits available in engineering and computer science. Nine of the ten collaborating schools are classified as Hispanic Serving Institutions. Scholarships and support for low-income and academically talented students, who may not otherwise be able to obtain engineering or computer science degrees will help to produce a well-trained workforce that will contribute to the economic well being of the nation.<br/><br/>The project seeks to address the need to expand the engineering and computer science workforce by increasing the success of Arizona State University students including students that transfer from community colleges. The program combines a network of engineering mentors with a successful student-centered and mentor-driven academic success and professional development course to significantly increase the number of community college students that consider, choose, continue and graduate with a bachelor of science in engineering or computer science.  At the center of the proposed initiative is a commitment to involving students in career-shaping projects that will permit them to discover, nurture, and fully develop their technical interests. Guided by grounded theory and social cognitive career theory, the project will also study the factors most central to maintaining effectiveness while scaling up a successful student-centered and mentor-intensive transfer student support system to encompass a larger group of collaborating institutions. Community colleges will play an increasingly important role in educating the nation's engineers. This statewide project will serve as a collaborative model for four-year and two-year schools across the nation. This research will provide knowledge helpful in establishing a transfer student support program in Arizona and will inform other university and community college networks in other parts of the United States. The findings from the program will be disseminated widely to the engineering and computer science education community."

The team is working to significantly increase the number of transfer students, especially women and underrepresented minority students, that graduate in engineering and computer science. In order to accomplish this, they are: 1) providing scholarships to students in the feeder schools and to transfer students at Arizona State University , 2) supporting student outreach activities at the feeder schools, 3) supporting engineering courses at the feeder schools by providing materials, tutoring, local engineering speakers, and tuition scholarships, 4) conducting ""Be an Engineer"" events at the feeder schools for both students and their parents, 5) providing classes, workshops, and seminars using live broadcast and videotape, 6) providing an engaged community of mentors with extensive experience and commitment for all students, 7) hosting an orientation at Arizona State University for engineering transfer students, 8) managing a center where engineering transfer students can study together and get the support needed to survive, and 9) working with transfer students through a time-tested ""career shaping"" academic scholarship workshop program. The project is building on an earlier successful program between Arizona State University and a set of metropolitan community colleges with similar goals. Evaluation efforts, involving formative and summative aspects, are being conducted by internal and external evaluators who are developing and monitoring indices for enrollment, persistence, and graduation. Broader impacts include the development and dissemination of models for collaboration between community colleges and four-year schools and the efforts to increase the number of women and minorities in engineering."

Computerized mechanized welding and cutting machines weld and cut 300 percent faster than manual methods. Automated electronics enable the welding and cutting processes to be more precise, as well as offering the potential to control and document the entire process. The fabrication and joining industry is rapidly adopting these new computerized technologies and advanced processes. As a result, a growing need exists for welding technicians who have more extensive knowledge of metallurgy, nondestructive examination, quality control, computerized data acquisition, and technical writing and reporting. In collaboration with industry partners, this project at Central Arizona College aims to develop curricula and associated materials for an advanced fabrication and joining program to prepare Advanced Welding Processes Technicians. It will include higher-level education and training not offered by most community college welding programs. Since the college is a both an Hispanic Serving Institution and a rural community college, this project will strive to encourage students from minority backgrounds to pursue science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) credentials. The curriculum, STEM content, and project-based learning exercises will be shared with the National Center for Welding Education and Training, the seven Hispanic Serving Institutions participating in the Science Foundation of Arizona Kick Starter project, and other community colleges. The welding programs at community colleges involved in the Science Foundation of Arizona will provide feedback on the effectiveness of the new curriculum and associated materials. This feedback will support the effort of the college to create quality learning products that foster student learning and help meet the country?s need for personnel with advanced fabrication and joining skills.<br/><br/>Developing curriculum and associated materials in advanced fabrication and joining processes is the first step in meeting the need for fabricators and welders with additional knowledge of data acquisition, metallurgy, and quality control land welding codes to ensure quality welds. Six new courses will be developed that will form a core advanced certificate, and four additional courses will be developed for the advanced processes technician specialization. The ten courses will be field-tested in the classroom during the second half of the three-year project, with at least ten students in the first cohort. Feedback from the students, their instructors, and industry partners will guide subsequent improvements to the curriculum. Students in the college certificate and associate degree welding programs, incumbent workers who need advanced skills, and students from other community college welding programs will be recruited to the program. The project will create project-based learning exercises and contextualized STEM content for the program.  These practices are research-validated best practices for teaching technical and science-based skills to learners, especially those from traditionally under-represented and disadvantaged backgrounds,. Project-based learning provides contextualized, authentic experiences (i.e. experiences that mimic what workers do in their jobs) that help students master challenging STEM concepts and processes.  This approach makes the science more understandable for students because it places the material in a real-world context (such as a welding shop) and often builds on content students have already mastered.  In this way, students can discover meaningful relationships between academic theory and practical, real world applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will also promote effective solutions that address these challenges. Institutions of higher education in rural areas and small towns face challenges that are uncommon to peer institutions in larger cities. These challenges include access to high speed Internet, lack of hands-on workforce training or undergraduate research, challenges in recruiting qualified faculty, difficulty in meeting enrollment minimums for new STEM programs, and problems accessing federal funding dollars. Hispanic-Serving Institutions are seeking solutions to challenges that are unique to their status as HSIs. This conference will document the intersecting needs, barriers, successes, opportunities, and priorities of existing and emerging rural HSIs. The expected outcomes include models for partnerships and collaborations among geographically dispersed partners, frameworks for industry engagement, improved understanding of effective practices in STEM teaching and learning, improved understanding of cultural relevance for students in rural communities, and best practices and approaches that improve the success of rural HSIs in obtaining external funding.<br/><br/>The conference aims to lay a foundation for understanding challenges and potential solutions for rural HSIs that, when addressed, will increase quality of life and economic success for the people of these communities. The conference will build on the NSF-funded University of Arizona HSI Conference: Transforming STEM Education in Hispanic Serving Institutions - Regional Insights from the Southwest (NSF 1748526). The proposed three-day Rural STEM HSI Conference will examine themes in undergraduate STEM education including: (1) K-12, Two-Year, and Four-Year Partnerships; (2) Career and Workforce Preparation; (3) Innovative STEM Teaching and Learning; (4) Student Support Strategies; (5) Culturally Responsive Education; and (6) External funding. The results will be compared to those from the previous University of Arizona HSI Conference via a qualitative study that integrates within-case and across-case analytic strategies. This comparison will augment knowledge and understanding about the specific challenges and opportunities in STEM undergraduate education at rural HSIs. The conference will generate a report to provide guidance on how to best serve the needs of STEM students at rural HSIs. The conference results will be disseminated to governmental agencies and higher education organizations via presentations at regional and national conferences. The long-term impact of this work will be to help rural HSIs position themselves as drivers to increase access to high-quality educational opportunities and develop the STEM workforce that will impact rural economic prosperity. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
