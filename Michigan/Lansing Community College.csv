Lansing Community College, in partnership with the local information technology industry group (LINC), is providing an information technology apprenticeship initiative that enables information technology students to get the industry-based technical experiences that puts them on a fast-track to become the experienced skilled employees that local employers urgently need. PRODEV is aligned with the recommendation of Capital Area Michigan Works Information Technology Advisory Committee from April 2007. <br/><br/>Recent reports predict that the IT industry in the Capital Region area needs to add nearly 1,300 jobs (14% growth) in the next 5 years, resulting is a severe shortage of high-skilled IT workers, especially those with at least associate degrees plus practical training. PRODEV meets those needs by proving registered IT students with apprenticeship opportunities that give them a degree and 2000 hours of practical experience."

The initiative provides a real life laboratory for students to learn and be ready to enter building science-energy management careers upon graduation. Through linked education-career pathways and the creation of a capstone experience laboratory, this initiative advances knowledge of critical technical and workplace skills for students and faculty. The project will take a system approach towards building science by integrating building science-energy management topics with STEM disciplines.  It leverages several resources, including already-developed curricula, standing industry advisory committees, and existing problem- and case-based student projects as the basis for the formal education-career model proposed by the project.  The broader impacts of this project include the creation of partnerships among the secondary and post-secondary schools and the building science-energy management industry that can serve as a national model, and the development and implementation of a pathway framework replicable in the other part of the country.  Recruitment of minorities as well as the involvement of the National Association of Women in Construction and Hard Hatted Women on the project is expected to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields."

This activity helps meet the urgent need of local employers for the emerging digital economy.  The program includes an online course for employment readiness, communication skills and job search skills.  A key component of the program is a full-time apprenticeship coach whose responsibility is to prepare students for work, monitor student progress and to encourage local employers to hire displaced workers.  <br/><br/>Goals of the project include partnering with local industry to increase the number of available positions and to place an increasing number of students with a particular emphasis on women, minorities and displaced workers.  Mentoring and marketing strategies are being assessed and results will be disseminated to allow other organizations to implement a similar program."
