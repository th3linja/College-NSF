The laboratory is equipped with self-contained workstations designed for hands-on applications of the measurement, control and troubleshooting of pressure, flow, level, temperature, heat exchangers, and analytic process loops. Experiments involve mechanical, physical, chemical, electronic, pneumatic, measurement, mathematical, spatial relations, and abstract reasoning disciplines."
