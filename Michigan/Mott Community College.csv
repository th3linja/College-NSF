MERIT is the                       midlevel network located in the state of Michigan that will                     provide operations and network information services.  It will                   give the colleges a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the               NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National                Backbone network.                                                                                                                                               The colleges needs greater functionality and network speed to be                able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers               along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.                 Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This                 is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative               educational resources.***//"

It is also providing a forum for joint industry/education collaboration focused on identifying manufacturing and simulation technologies critical to the success of the automotive industry centered in the southeastern Michigan region. Curriculum work is addressing mathematics, science and technology components essential to the lean manufacturing enterprise and its virtual design and manufacturing simulation activities. Expertise is being developed by engaging subject matter experts and by providing workplace experiences for faculty, teachers and students from a variety of diverse backgrounds. The DMSP is utilizing the Wisconsin Instructional Design System (WIDS) to create educational modules designed to enhance existing manufacturing programs and develop modules that focus on industry-validated simulation competencies.<br/><br/>DMSP partners include Mott, Macomb, Oakland, and Henry Ford Community Colleges, Central Michigan University, General Motors, Daimler-Chrysler, Delphi Automotive, Detroit Center Tool, Delmia, Mechanical Dynamics, and the Tech Prep consortiums of Genesee, Macomb, Oakland, St. Clair, and Wayne counties. This partnership involves the Design and Manufacturing Alliance (DMA), an established partnership between the four community colleges and several business/industry representatives focused on design and manufacturing careers. <br/><br/>The DMSP is enhancing existing Design/Drafting/CAD Associate Degree programs by incorporating and using simulation to validate design scenarios. In addition, the Manufacturing Simulation Technology - Robotics program (NSF/ATE #9950052) is being modified to address the needs of the virtual machining simulation industry. Curriculum deliverables include modules that update existing design and manufacturing degrees for 21st century industry and post-Associate degree or certificate programs that address simulation competencies and software products. The goal is to supply the automotive manufacturing industry with skilled workers capable of embracing advanced design and simulation activities that support more efficient development of automobiles. The DMSP seeks to increase the number of minority and underrepresented candidates in the field and is marketing programs and opportunities to schools, businesses, and parent/professional groups."

What is required is the use of technology tools and simulations to shorten the design and delivery cycle of new products. While this emerging technology holds great promise, no curriculum exists at the community college level that integrates manufacturing and simulation skills to prepare technicians for the 21st century workforce.<br/><br/>This project supports systemic reform in response to industry need through industry mapping, curriculum development, professional development and dissemination. It also provides a forum for industry to work with faculty to develop curriculum. This curriculum provides model solutions to technical problems in real life settings to meet the requirements of the 21st century manufacturing workforce, and incorporates advanced math and science components throughout newly developed manufacturing simulation technology curriculum (MST). The project is creating avenues through workplace experiences for manufacturers to hire MST graduates from diverse backgrounds. <br/><br/>The program architecture to be used was developed at Sinclair's NSF-funded AIM Center and features a competency-based modularized curriculum to develop a ""systems-level"" MST associate degree program. The focus for this project is robotic simulation. A Tech Prep (TPAD) curriculum, and support materials for MST graduates are being identified and specialty modules developed. Subject matter experts from industry, education and the federal sector identify industry needs and develop curriculum in MST. Instructional materials are being delivered through distance learning so that high schools, community colleges and four year universities have access to curricula. In order to carry out these plans, a partnership has been formed with other community and four-year colleges, public school districts, industry and government.<br/><br/>This project is identifying TPAD curriculum for Grades 11 through 14 and adults re-entering the workforce. It is supplying skilled workers to support emerging manufacturing simulation technology industry, and is providing new career opportunities for women, Hispanics, African-Americans, and disabled persons. Faculty are being trained on the use of simulation technology/integrating technology into curriculum/and pedagogy. A virtual electronic library supports and distributes MST curricula including a repository of simulation applications."
