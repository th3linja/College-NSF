Technical  mathematics is designed for students in associate degree programs  such as architectural construction, computer information systems,  electrical/electronics technology, energy technology, industrial  drafting, manufacturing engineering, and robotics. It is the only  college math course taken by approximately 100,000 of the nation's  community college students prior to their entry in the workplace.  This project ties in with an award to Henry Ford Community College  by Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) to  incorporate the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM)  Standards in the technical mathematics sequence. Henry Ford  Community College's pilot program also creates a context for  cooperation between career education faculty and mathematics  faculty in the development of applied real-life problems that are  being used as activities within the redesigned course.  Representatives from companies such as Ford Motor, AC Delco, and  Kerr Manufacturing are participating in designing Activities that  incorporate industrial applications. The activities use  computer-assisted programs such as MathCad and Geometer's Sketchpad  to encourage students to collect evidence, to problem solve, and to  work collaboratively."

The Work and Spatial Information Technology Education (WORK/SITE) Partnership is developing and establishing a community-based model to integrate GIS field experiences into high schools and to prepare undergraduate students in community colleges and regional universities for careers using complex GIS technologies.    WORK/SITE is testing a new educational model relying on emerging skill standards and designed to respond swiftly to changing GIS technology and expanding workplaae applications.  Primary projects include community-based curriculum modules, courseware, and Project Kits the Alliance is disseminating using Internet-based technologies.  In the high schools, interdisciplinary teams of four teachers and four students per teacher work on community-based projects.  These address urban issues that affect the communities.  Companies/organizations provide ""real life"" projects and data for students to develop GIS solutions focusing on urban issues such as public safety, crime reduction, brown field redevelopment, and environmental justice.    The model joins partners committed to GIS -- two traditional educational institutions with businesses -- to train GIS educators and to develop curriculum which integrates employer-defined, work-based GIS projects.  The curriculum permits students to be GIS practitioners while being engaged in formal GIS education at the certificate, associates, or bachelors degree levels.  Because the WORK/SITE approach, when fully implemented, relies on an existing traditional educational infrastructure, it facilitates an efficient use of societal resources in expanding the availability of trained GIS personnel."

To be competitive, these same companies must have a workplace that functions at high performance levels.  The maintenance function is the key to survival in a high performance workplace.  Each company must employ maintenance technicians who must develop, retain, and continuously enhance increasingly complex multifunctional skills to perform in an industrial high performance workplace environment.  Maintenance engineering technicians are unique in that they must acquire and use basic skills and knowledge, occupation-specific skills, multi-trade skills, and cross-functional skills to keep up with the changing demands of the American workplace.  The field of maintenance engineering technology encompasses all of the industry and represents the lifeblood of building and plant facility's operations and operations in production and process industries.  The Maintenance Engineering Technology Program (METPRO) at Henry Ford Community College (HFCC) links education, government, business and industry to consolidate the resources necessary to prepare persons to enter, upgrade or enhance their position in the maintenance engineering technology field as high performance multifunctional maintenance engineering technicians (HP-METEC) with the following: 1) Development and implementation of a national standard and certification system and a maintenance engineering technology curricula at the secondary school and community college levels and articulating these programs with related university programs, 2) ensure basic math, science, communications and SCANS considerations are addressed in maintenance engineering technology programs, 3) provide enhanced vision of the maintenance engineering technology field for high school teachers, college and university faculty, 4) provide direct links through partnerships with business and industry to ensure workplace experiences and competencies are part maintenance engineering technology curricula to allow smooth  transition of graduates into the workplace and, 5) address the upgrade training needs of experienced workers with ease of access to METPRO courses and its certification system."

Working closely with a  steering committee comprised primarily of industry representatives,  the HFCC project team is determining current technological  applications that require physics that is included in the  introductory course.  Industry is also contributing to the design  of the writing component of the technical physics course, providing  samples of technical reports appropriate in the industrial context."

In the first stage of the project, writing instructors work with mathematics and science faculty members to develop writing activities that encourage students to formulate in writing what they are learning about mathematics and science. As a result of these faculty professional development activities, science and mathematics faculty become adept at formulating and assessing writing assignments, defining learning outcomes, and encouraging student reflection.  In the second stage of the project, faculty members implement a number of writing activities in their classes.  Formative evaluation includes meetings among the science and mathematics faculty and the writing instructor to critique classroom practice and results and make necessary revisions. Further evaluation includes examination of faculty- and student-generated portfolios, as well as exit interviews of both students and faculty. <br/> <br/>"
