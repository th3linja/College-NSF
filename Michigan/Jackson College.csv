GOAL: To strengthen the four degree programs requiring extensive<br/>STEM preparation : Ecology; Fishery Biology & Culture; Marine Biology; and Secondary<br/>Education - Science by providing graduates with emergent job-ready knowledge. While the panel<br/>found these degree emphases generally responsive to employment needs within the Alaskan<br/>economy, they identified the following gaps to be addressed as objectives under this goal:<br/>OBJECTIVES: 1) Establish and provide instructional capacity in the use of Geographic<br/>Information Systems (GIS); 2) provision of a stronger theoretical orientation in ecology, fisheries<br/>and marine biology coursework; 3) establish and offer a course that comprehensively surveys the<br/>enormously diverse Alaskan environment, its natural resources, and its resource management<br/>needs.<br/>Student needs. GOAL: To strengthen Native student success in STEM coursework that<br/>leads to degrees in sciences and mathematics. Data compiled by the Alaska Department of<br/>Education and Alaskan school districts reflect that Native high school students achieve far below<br/>average in comparison to other Alaskan students, especially in math. SJC's experience indicates<br/>that first-semester developmental coursework is insufficient to effectively prepare students for<br/>college level courses. Earlier intervention is required, and can be informed by data identified and<br/>quantified through High School Graduation Qualifying Exam and the No Child Left Behind Act<br/>testing provisions.<br/>OBJECTIVES: 1) Establish and provide a summer academic enrichment program in<br/>math and science for Native high school students in partnership with school districts. 2) Provide<br/>campus-based academic support services wrapped around math and science course work.<br/>Faculty development. GOAL: To strengthen the effectiveness of SJC faculty in<br/>teaching and mentoring Native students in their STEM courses. Available literature indicates that<br/>intercultural classroom communications is complex and frequently counterintuitive, and yet,<br/>preparation for teaching in culturally diverse classrooms is seldom a requirement for college<br/>faculty.<br/>OBJECTIVE: 1) To establish and provide pre-academic-year cross-cultural education<br/>faculty workshops, and participation in ongoing workshops as opportunities arise. This will<br/>include 2) participation in school year-end assessment and refinement of the College's strategies<br/>in supporting Alaska Native student success, particularly in the sciences and math."

SJC is <br/>committed to its founding mission to serve the needs of all students, with an emphasis on <br/>Alaska Natives and students from rural communities. SJC needs to evaluate its current <br/>STEM program to determine the effectiveness of its STEM instructional program in <br/>preparing students for success throughout their education and careers. <br/>   <br/>SJC requires 12 months and 2 phases for STEM program assessment: <br/>* Phase 1 (October 1, 2003 . June 1, 2004): assessment and evaluation of <br/>current STEM infrastructure and offerings. <br/>* Phase 2 (June 1, 2004 . October 1, 2004): creation of an institutional plan <br/>to increase enrollment and retention in STEM programs and development <br/>of full TCUP proposal. <br/> <br/>At the end of the 12 months SJC will have conducted an assessment of its current <br/>STEM course offerings, evaluated the effectiveness of current teaching practices, <br/>developed an institutional plan to increase and retain students in STEM courses, written a <br/>full TCUP implementation grant, and created an assessment system to further evaluate <br/>STEM course effectiveness for SJC.s unique student body. <br/>  <br/>"

Our marketing plan will be to encourage traditionally underserved students, such as Alaskan Natives, low income and rural (bush) students. The camp will be preceded by a three-day workshop for teachers to become familiar with update science concepts. The camp will be held on the Sheldon Jackson College campus located in downtown Sitka, on the Pacific Ocean at the edge of the Tongass National Forest in the Heart of Alaska's inside passage. The cam will utilize Expeditionary Learning School techniques: guided questions, and posing challenges to have students explore scientific arenas. The goal of the camp will be to expose young women to science in relation to social and ethical issues. The camp will cover the scientific method, scientific assumptions and explore how science impacts our culture, how the media portrays scientists, and science communication. The experience should result in positive student attitudes towards exploring careers in science. Further, time will be spent with each individual developing a career pathway that will map out a plan for courses during their high school career."
