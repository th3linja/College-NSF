MERIT is the midlevel  network located in the state of Michigan that will provide  operations and network information services.  It will give Grand  Rapids Community College a 56 thousand bits per second connection  to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)  National Backbone network.    The college needs greater functionality and network speed to be  able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers  along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.   Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This is  also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative  educational resources."

Developed materials reflect workforce needs, delivered using a constructivist approach.  The intellectual merit is the development of broadly applicable processes for integrating GC-MS into community college laboratory course curricula to enhance learning and interest. Professional development and summer camp opportunities enhance high school faculty and students' understanding of GC-MS while demonstrating practical connections between science and technology, and serve as a model for high school-community college partnerships. Broader impacts include better prepared students through engaging hands-on science education, enhanced educational infrastructure, and a close partnership with local high schools. <br/><br/>The independent evaluation encompasses formative assessment of instructor content knowledge and engagement, coupled with assessment of student learning gains and attitudes toward science through review of course work, interviews and focus groups."
