Automakers, in response to economic, political, and environmental pressures, are expanding their development and production of more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly automobiles through advanced automotive technologies that fall into three main categories: hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), alternative fuel vehicles (AFV) including new generation diesel and biofuels, and fuel cell vehicles (FCV). These categories are both descriptive of the technologies and inclusive of new generations of alternative propulsion systems yet to be developed that require service and development technicians and technologists to acquire new skills sets and knowledge. Projections show that HEV, AFV, and FCV will grow considerably in the next 20 years, and there is an unmet demand for a future generation of technicians. With more than 26,000 automotive technicians in Michigan, a planning grant for a regional center for advanced automotive technologies is strategic in that the state is home to the American auto industry and international epicenter for research and development of new technologies.<br/><br/>The Center for Advanced Automotive Technology (CAAT) is being planned to meet the growing and evolving advanced technical education needs of automotive technicians by providing modern training modules and programs for advanced automotive technologies that will enter the market in the near future. Activities to reform current automotive technician education curriculum at the secondary and postsecondary school levels include synthesis of existing materials; creation of curriculum; adaptation and offering of degree programs and professional development for educators; curriculum alignment to new state high school content standards in Science, Mathematics, Engineering  and Technology (STEM) subjects; and utilization of educational research and industry partners to infuse research into the curriculum. The core project team for the planning process includes (a) postsecondary education institutions (Macomb Community College, Kalamazoo Valley Community College, Henry Ford Community College,and Wayne State University); (b) secondary education partners; and (c) industry and government partners. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of CAAT is based on the partners' abilities and capacities to improve student learning in advanced automotive technology (HEV, AFV, and FCV) by collecting the most advanced technological expertise from industry and education partners, integrating existing and evolving curricula into a comprehensive educational package, and adapting that curriculum to targeted audiences among students and educators across the array of educational partners and the community. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The auto industry is critical to the entire nation. If the United States is to minimize reliance on foreign oil, use of evolving propulsion technologies must be expanded and include training of the service and development sectors. Documents produced are being made available to educational and industry partners across the United States."

Automotive service technicians must possess HEV-specialized knowledge acquired through additional education in order to service these vehicles. This education includes safety, regulations, control systems and propulsion systems. Currently automobile manufacturers are training their HEV automotive service technicians entirely in-house, which limits the number of automotive service technicians available for the growing hybrid market. There is a clear need for a systematic training program on HEV, particularly in Southeast Michigan, where automotive manufacturers and their suppliers are highly concentrated. The goal of this project is to fill this need by developing an industry-based learning environment for HEV technology. The guiding vision of this HEV Learning Environment is an integrated education and industrial based training program for students in automotive programs in community colleges, automotive service technicians, engineering technologists, and K-12 automotive teachers. <br/><br/>In order to develop this program, a partnership has been formed between faculty of Macomb Community College Automotive Technology Program and the Division of Engineering Technology at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. The partnership also includes industrial partners from major automobile manufacturers and suppliers. The planned activities for the project include (1) Developing an HEV curriculum and integrating it with the existing Associate of Applied Science program in Automotive Technology; (2) Revising existing courses and developing required HEV specific courses; (3) Creating an HEV specialized laboratory; (4) Developing a two-day short course on HEV technology available for distance learning; (5) Developing and delivering seminars and workshops for different groups of audiences, including K-12 teachers, (6) Creating internship and co-op opportunities, in-plant visits, and an expert lecturer series; (7) Initiating a pilot program for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) certification in hybrid vehicles; and (8) Providing transfer student advising by WSU faculty at MCC. <br/><br/>This project holds intellectual merit in that it is developing the first systematic courses and degree programs to educate automotive technicians in the emerging technology of HEV. To date, no automotive program in HEV has been developed for the community college level. In addition to the HEV curriculum at MCC, this program also provides workshops and seminars for general audiences and a short course available for distance learning.  <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the proposed HEV program extend beyond Southeast Michigan to affect the automotive industry nationally and internationally through the potential of the program to serve as a model for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) HEV training, and planned dissemination activities. These activities include posting course materials online, presenting project results at professional conferences, and delivering a short course through the Internet for corporate education programs.<br/>"
