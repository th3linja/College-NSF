In this project, faculty are adapting the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey Quantitative Reasoning Across the Discipline program funded through the National Science Foundation to the needs of a community college population and curriculum. The project is focusing on beginning algebra, intermediate algebra, and introductory courses from communications, social science, business, and health. Data is being collected to compare students' attainment of mathematics skills in classes offered prior to this integration of disciplines and afterwards."
