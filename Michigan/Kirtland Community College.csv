MICHnet is the midlevel network located in the state of Michigan and it will provide operations management and information services and will give Kirtland Community College a connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative educational resources."
