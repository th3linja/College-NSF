Michnet is the midlevel network located in the state of Michigan that will provide operations and network information services. It will give Lake Michigan College a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative educational resources."

The multimedia presentation program has the flexibility to retrieve laboratory images for display at any point in the lecture. A computer driven video system enhances microscopy, dissection, demonstrations and experiments. The laboratory exercises are displayed live on the closed circuit video system and selected segments are stored on computer disc or video tape for further analysis or review. The video system captures, stores and instantly retrieves rare microscopic motions and other unique laboratory observations. Images are enlarged, and then compared in split screen."

Applications of FTIR spectrophotometer are being incorporated into all chemistry courses with the emphasis on organic chemistry. Organic chemistry students use the FTIR to study functional group interconversion, identify unknowns, follow the progress of reactions, and help establish the level of purity of synthesized compounds. Other introductory general chemistry classes may use the FTIR in the chemistry content related to carbon compounds and experiments. The introduction of the FTIR spectrophotometer into the chemistry program, particularly into the teaching of Organic Chemistry, is aligning the curriculum and laboratory experiences that students receive with the expectations and practice of 4-year transfer institutions and in industry."
