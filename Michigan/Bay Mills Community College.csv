Expanding the research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal, allowing the institution's faculty and administrators to design and develop a comprehensive plan for improving and expanding STEM instruction.<br/><br/>Bay Mills Community College (BMCC) serves the Bay Mills Indian Community in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.  This project will determine the best use of their current infrastructure in advanced manufacturing technology to create sustainable STEM programs that can further support regional economic development and student learning.  The Principal Investigators will deliver a comprehensive roadmap for subsequent implementation of both a certification and associate level degree program offering in STEM related fields through activities that include: 1) identifying community, regional and national workforce needs in strength areas at the college; 2) assessing existing related courses and programs at other institutions; 3) completing a state analysis at BMCC; 4) conducting secondary- and high-school level workshops about STEM careers in order to gauge interest and awareness; and 5) connecting needs to BMCC's courses and programs to identify areas and necessary resources for development."

To assess current STEM curriculum, BMCC will form two committees. An internal STEM planning committee will meet two times per month for the entire planning year. These meetings will allow BMCC instructors, staff, and administrators the opportunity to conduct a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis of current STEM curriculum. This analysis will be shared with an external Advisory Development Committee. The external committee will consist of experts from universities across Michigan, the Tribal Chairman from a neighboring tribe, whose students represent a significant presence at BMCC, and the Director of Michigan Works. The external committee will further refine the analysis of STEM curriculum and assist BMCC in analyzing 4-year institution and industry requirements for STEM related careers."
