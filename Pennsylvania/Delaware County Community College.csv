JVNCnet is the  midlevel network located in the state of New Jersey and it will  provide operations management and information services and it  will give Delaware County Community College a connection to the  NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National  Backbone network.    The college needs greater functionality and network speed to be  able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers  along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.  Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This  is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative  educational resources."

Southeastern Pennsylvania is experiencing an increased demand for highly qualified employees trained in STEM fields due to the regional concentration of companies that focus on information technology, biotechnology, pharmaceutical, financial services, advanced manufacturing, engineering and research. To help address this need, DCCC will build on its investments in STEM education to recruit, retain, and graduate/transfer 40 low-income, academically promising students in STEM majors through its new STARS initiative. The well-established experience of the college with serving students who are low income, first generation, nontraditional, and challenged by disabilities will provide the foundation for supporting students to be successful in STEM majors. Using recruitment activities that target students who are currently underrepresented in STEM majors at the college, the project will provide a positive and transformative impact on the diversity of STEM programs. This will enrich and expand the academic experience for all students and increase access to educational and professional pathways for diverse students, including women, students of color and economically disadvantaged students, thereby diversifying the STEM workforce. A qualified research team will determine if a STEM Topics course and faculty mentoring combined with early exposure to research at a community college influence student academic and careers goals and retention in STEM majors.  Dissemination of lessons learned from this project will inform other community colleges of effective strategies for broadening the participation of underserved and underprivileged students in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>In addition to providing scholarship support, this S-STEM project will create learning cohorts of students who receive mentoring, tutoring support, access to specialized services, and individualized assistance to transfer to four-year institutions to continue their academic preparation. The STARS scholars will also engage in activities to explore STEM careers through a new seminar-style course, guest speakers, participation in internships and co-ops, and an introduction to a research experience in their second year.  Faculty members involved in the project represent diverse ethnicities and have experience in various academic, corporate and research settings, and they will collaborate with other college personnel to improve retention through mentoring and other activities. The project will strengthen the connection between the STEM students with regional employers while exposing them to career options and opportunities. In addition, the project will incorporate existing college resources with newly developed activities to enhance dual enrollment programs by providing students with well-explained career options. The commitment of the college to student success is demonstrated by its recognition as a Leader College in the national Achieving the Dream initiative. By pro-actively focusing on ways to increase student success at every level, the college has achieved important gains in retention and completion, particularly among populations that often exhibit the greatest deficits in academic accomplishment, income levels, and societal supports. The project will provide a replicable, holistic, and supportive network of activities and services to strengthen academic achievement, retention, completion, transfer and employment of students who traditionally face significant barriers to academic success.  It is expected that the college will replicate proven strategies with other students not included in the STARS program to improve opportunities in STEM fields for many additional students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Meeting this need is critical because the advanced manufacturing sector is growing in the region, where it is a major economic driver, with an estimated $36 million Gross Regional Product (GRP).  The STLET Project is employing curricular improvements and professional development activities to enhance and deliver advanced manufacturing technician education that meets industry needs.  The main project activities are a) improving and implementing an industry-aligned, apprenticeship-based early college-to-university Electro-Mechanical technology career preparation pathway and b) upgrading the teaching competencies of faculty through competency assessment, formal pedagogy training, and engagement in a community of practice.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the STLET design and approach is that it is comprehensive, innovative and replicable.  It is comprehensive in that it is addressing both teaching and learning outcomes.  STLET is innovative because it is integrating two proven educational programs (early college programs and community college-university transfer agreements) and a competency-based apprenticeship into a career preparation pathway.  Normally these three programs, with demonstrated success in improving completion outcomes at both high school and college/university levels, are offered independent of one another.  In STLET, however, they are interwoven to provide a structured career preparation pathway.  This pathway is replicable and can be adopted by other community colleges seeking to assist in the economic development of their regions.  This demonstrates STLET's broader impact to the larger advanced technological community."

The lab will be used to present new material to  entire classes; stimulate advanced and independent study  activities; provide an environment to produce laboratory  stimulations; enable faculty to use more varied formative and  summative assessment techniques to monitor student progress;  implement specialized software programs for instruction; and shift  the emphasis of teaching to a more conceptual approach. An  important additional outcome of this technologically-advanced  learning environment will be to serve as a model to other  undergraduate institutions, particularly community colleges, in  creating new ways to stimulate and enhance learning in math and  science."
