This cyber infrastructure (CI) upgrade will coincide with their construction of a new STEM building and future renovation of the current STEM facilities at Newtown (main) campus. This initiative upgrades Bucks CI to support research with a science DMZ to prioritize data transfers among systems located at Bucks, offers an outdoor high performance Wi-Fi network as a science DMZ extension, and provides Internet2 to support faculty and student research through the statewide education network.  The dedicated, advanced network allows for the speeds, packet integrity, and lack of interference from competing applications for research-based data transfer, enabling the faculty and their students to conduct their activities. Bucks' lead institution partner, the University of Pennsylvania, is aiding with design and technical services to ensure the science DMZ meets current and future needs and is sustainable by Bucks. <br/><br/>This next-generation infrastructure establishes a dedicated network and provides data transfer services to support broader scientific research and applications. This benefits projects investigating improved forms of image recognition, applied engineering, and other computational sciences. With the bounty of research at the University of Pennsylvania, faculty and students at Bucks have access to scientific domains at a level not previously available, extending our intellectual opportunities. Additionally, with advanced manufacturing, nursing and other science-related activity in the county and surrounding area, the science DMZ indirectly benefits the people, educational institutions, and businesses of the region."

To recruit more students into the Engineering Technology program, the project will develop articulation agreements with the College's Center for Workforce Development.  Through this articulation, credits toward an Associate of Applied Science Degree in Engineering Technology will be granted for specific certifications obtained through the Center for Workforce Development.  In addition, the project will award certifications, digital badges, or college credits for other prior learning, including knowledge and skills gained from military training.  The project intends to strengthen the Engineering Technology curriculum by including a new course on manufacturing technology, requiring business courses that emphasize entrepreneurship, and developing practical experiences such as job-shadowing and internships.    The project will also support a collaboration between Bucks County Community College and Drexel University to strengthen the education of both engineering technicians and engineering technologists.  It is expected that the improved Engineering Technology curriculum and the innovative connection between certifications and an associate degree will increase the number of engineering technicians who can meet the needs of local and regional employers.<br/><br/>The project aims to develop robust collaborations between four Bucks County Community College programs or departments:  The Engineering Technology program, the Business Studies Department, the Center for Workforce Development (which awards several engineering-relevant certifications), and the Industry Advisory Board (which advises the College on issues related to industry needs and trends).  Through this collaboration, the project aims to modernize the Engineering Technology curriculum to increase the emphasis on soft skills training and career exploration, and to develop associated certifications and/or other credentials. As part of this modernization, a credit-bearing manufacturing course with an updated laboratory component will be developed. The project plans to offer opportunities that help students explore engineering technician career options, including a formalized job shadowing program.  It is expected that the project will contribute to the national need for a highly-trained STEM workforce by increasing the number of students who pursue engineering technician careers, and by better preparing these technicians to be successful on the job.  It also has the potential to create a model for how to successfully link certification programs to credit-bearing programs.  Such a model might be implemented by other colleges and universities.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The introduction of an AAS degree in applied engineering technology at the college is designed to develop outreach strategies that leverage community partnership programs with industries and educational establishments in the surrounding region. Occupational majors in engineering technology allow students to take a variety of technical courses leading to a versatile degree which can be used directly for employment as a skilled technician or for transfer to a four-year institution. In addition to industry partnerships with Lockheed Martin and other firms and an educational partnership with Drexel University, the college plans to incorporate many companies, four-year institutions, high schools, and other community establishments into the program, uniting industries and educational institutions. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is manifested through the introduction of an AAS degree in applied engineering technology at the college, which stimulates and increases the level of learning by offering students educational opportunities which far exceed current curriculum options. By ultimately providing concentrations in a variety of technical areas, students can choose a path that is compatible with their academic interests and career choices. This degree encourages the study of engineering technology by providing a career pathway for students from the community college to either a technological position in industry or into a four-year program. Both employment and transfer allow for advancement of the student leading to an expanded and varied educational experience. In addition students have the opportunity to increase their educational level in the same field as their degrees. The versatility of the major allows students the opportunity to explore other career options through co-ops, internships, and job opportunities. This allows for further advancement of students, which in turn provides transfer institutions and industries with a broader, more in-depth intellectual base, ultimately leading to a better educated, more highly skilled workforce. <br/><br/>The broader impacts include the development of the AAS degree in applied engineering technology, which leads to a diverse population of students entering the program at many different stages in their educational careers. High schools, the community college, four-year institutions and industries are connected through educational opportunities, co-ops, internships, and job opportunities. Students who do not want the mathematical rigor of a conventional engineering track have the option of studying engineering technology from an algebra-based hands-on approach. Thus, the AAS degree in applied engineering technology is available to a much wider array of students with more diverse backgrounds than the AA degree in engineering. The goal is to actively recruit women and underrepresented minority students as well as students with disabilities. Partnerships include research opportunities for faculty members."
