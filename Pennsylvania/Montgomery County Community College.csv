The resulting commercial biomanufacturing facilities hire between 400 and 600 employees, at least fifty percent of whom are technicians in ten biomanufacturing jobs; the industry reports a ten to fifteen percent attrition rate per year. Community college-biomanufacturer partnerships create a stable, local supply of entry level and replacement technicians and an articulated career pathway that begins in high school, continues to community college and then to university, with opportunities for apprenticeships, internships and employment. The partnership can also provide for incumbent technician training for the biomanufacturer at the neighboring community college that can sustain both the biomanufacturer and the biomanufacturing program. Finally, related crossover industries that use the same skill set have developed in the last few years including the biomanufacture of biofuels, replacement organs, and stem cells. Working together, community college-biomanufacturer partnerships provide support for a local bioeconomy. <br/><br/>The NBC2 has been working for over three years to develop the local biomanufacturing education and training and workforce infrastructure in six Hubs throughout the northeast. The center has developed hands-on instructional materials for the ten biomanufacturing jobs based on global biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry skill standards. It has developed BIOMAN, an annual biomanufacturing conference for faculty and teacher participants. There is a website at www.biomanufacturing.org for dissemination of activities and products. The center has mentored the establishment of biomanufacturing programs and courses at community colleges, high schools and universities in the northeast and nation. Its relationships with biomanufacturers can sustain the biomanufacturing programs that have been built. <br/><br/>In this renewal of the NBC2, the center is taking curriculum and instructional materials for the ten biomanufacturing jobs to the next level, by creating a hands-on laboratory manual, an industry-written textbook, short courses for incumbent technicians, and instructional ancillaries. It continues to expand the website, adding a career website, and continues to offer the BIOMAN conference. It is aggressively building local biomanufacturing infrastructure by focusing on high school students through Introduction to Biomanufacturing teachers' workshops in a partnership with Bio-Rad, and incumbent technician training through short courses offered by the NBC2's National Biomanufacturing Institute (NBI). The center is bringing in new resources by expanding partnerships to include biomanufacturers and community colleges throughout the nation in southern, mid-western and western clusters directed by community college faculty with expertise in biopharmaceutical biomanufacturing. Through a partnership with the National Institute for Work and Learning of the Academy for Educational Development it is collecting employment data to show the influence of the activities.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: This  includes: 1) the development of local learning communities to support the biopharmaceutical manufacturing company's need for biomanufacturing technicians and the student's need for a biomanufacturing educational pathway from high school to community college to universities; 2) a Global Biomanufacturing Curriculum repository based on harmonized biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry skill standards ready for deposit or withdrawal and linked to the Bio-Link Clearinghouse; 3) the use of video, 2nd Life, and gaming technologies to give students a better understanding of large-scale biomanufacturing; 4) the use of skills in biopharmaceutical manufacturing to support the development of local crossover industries such as the biomanufacture of replacement organs, biofuels and stem cells; 5) data on the expansion of biomanufacturing programs, the number of students in these programs and the growth of jobs within the bio-based economy. <br/><br/>Broader impact: This includes: 1) creation of strong biomanufacturer-community college partnerships to provide sustainability for the community college program and a local pipeline of employees for the biomanufacturer; 2) emphasis on high school biomanufacturing courses and programs to develop the local pipeline for biomanufacturing; 3) use of new technologies to highlight the differences between large-scale and lab-scale biomanufacturing; 4) on-the-job training for students in 21st century advanced technology apprenticeships and internships; and 5) the creation of a self-sustaining infrastructure for biomanufacturing education and training and the biomanufacturing workforce that supports a growing bioeconomy."

In addition, it expands the NBC2 curricular materials, adding additional biofuels and new stem cell hands-on laboratories, virtual industrial biomanufacturing production modules in partnership with the world's largest contract biomanufacturer, and an online lecture series to be used to accompany hands-on laboratories in biomanufacturing courses. The project also is experimenting with flexible packaging of NBC2 curricular modules to allow customization of courses for various audiences (high school, community college, university, student graduates and incumbent workers) and time frames. It is building a ""Course in a Box"" for many modules in order to provide access to the materials and supplies needed to teach each module. Public understanding of biomanufacturing career paths is enhanced through the expansion of a career website at www.biomanufacturingcareers.org. The NBC2 is working to offer a National Association of Manufacturing-endorsed biomanufacturing technician certification. The project is documenting and publicizing details about career paths of students using web-based data analysis that tracks students and shows trends in industry. The Center expects to apply for non-profit status to sustain the center after NSF ATE funding. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project includes: 1) generation of a complete suite of curriculum products using different pedagogical approaches to teach biopharmaceutical, biofuels and other crossover biomanufacturing fields, including hands-on laboratories, textbooks, online lectures with online ancillary support.  In addition, the project is developing virtual biomanufacturing equipment and processes to teach, assess and practice troubleshooting; 2) availability of these products in many different formats, including traditional print or online for use by diverse populations of students; 3) a career path that includes high school, community college, biomanufacturing experience, and a career in biomanufacturing; and 4) use of a web-based data analysis tools to track student career paths and show trends in industry.  <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the proposal include: 1) creation of a national network of self-sustaining local infrastructures for biomanufacturing education and training, and the workforce to support a growing bioeconomy; 2) institutionalization of biomanufacturing education and training courses and programs; 3) continued development of new instructional materials to grow and enhance current offerings; 4) a biomanufacturing certification exam endorsed by the National Association of Manufacturers; 5) data collected on biomanufacturing career paths and the bioeconomy; and 6) formation of a non-profit entity to sell products and services which in time will support NBC2 functions of growing partners, mentoring programs, promoting biomanufacturing career paths, updating curricular offerings, and providing professional development opportunities for students, faculty, teachers and technicians."
