To address this need, the Community College of Beaver County in collaboration with local high schools, the Beaver County Career and Technical Center, five community colleges in Texas, and four regional industry partners are developing an associate degree in process technology. Regional assets to support this effort include the necessary infrastructure for expansion of the types of industries that employ process technicians, abundant natural resources, human capital, and existing industries. The college is geographically located in the center of two prime shale natural gas resource areas and close to a chemical, energy, and manufacturing corridor. Existing petrochemical facilities include NOVA Chemicals and BASF and a site targeted by Shell Oil for the construction of an ethane cracker plant. The goal of the project is to identify and prepare a diverse human capital stream to meet the current and future process technology industry needs in the tri-state region. Specific objectives are to (1) enhance and develop industrial and community partnerships; (2) adopt, customize, and implement a Texas-based process technology curriculum; (3) develop a Career Pathways Program for high school students, and articulation agreements with four-year colleges and universities; and (4) increase enrollment and retention of women in process technology programs.<br/><br/>The curriculum is being made available to 14 community colleges in PA and other institutions in the tri-state region.  The Career Pathways Program and articulations may be adapted and adopted by other process technology programs across the nation at high schools, community colleges and universities. In addition to regional and state-wide partnerships, the college has strong networks across the United States through the Strategic Horizons Network, Achieving the Dream, the American Association of Community Colleges and the League for Innovation in the Community College. Project knowledge is being shared through presentations at regional and national conferences and by hosting delegations with similar program interests. In collaboration with the National Institute for Women in Trades & Technology, the college is developing outreach and recruitment efforts to increase enrollment of female students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields to benefit society as a whole. <br/><br/>The Texas-based North American Process Technology Alliance curriculum, developed under an ATE grant, is being adapted to include an associate degree, stackable credentials, and non-credit articulations to allow graduates to start or stop out at different points. It is being customized for competency-based, hybrid delivery for inclusion of incumbent workers. The project is also developing a Career Pathways Program for middle-school and high-school students through the creation of Career Awareness Workshops and dual enrollment opportunities for recruitment. Networks of support from higher education, industry and government are critically important to the recruitment and retention of all students in technology and engineering programs. The curriculum is designed to provide a broad base of mathematics, science, computer literacy, process technology, soft skills (reliability, leadership, communication, and conflict resolution) and hands-on mechanical aptitude development."

The expectation is that these changes will increase student accessibility and the number of credentialed process technicians in the tristate region (Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia).  An economic report from the American Chemical Society predicts that, by 2025, development of the region's natural gas resources will create 25,000 new job in the region's energy and advanced manufacturing sectors.  The proposed Flexible Entry/Flexible Exit format will build upon the successful model developed by Polk State College with a prior NSF award.  This program format permits students to enroll in PTEC technical courses at virtually any point in the academic year, complete the courses at their own pace, and increase the amount of time spent on hands-on technical education. By accommodating personal and professional schedules, this approach could also enable existing workers and non-traditional students to enroll in the program.  Thus, the program format can broaden the diversity of graduates who are prepared for careers in the region's rapidly expanding energy and advanced manufacturing sectors.  <br/><br/>The goals of the Process Technology: Flexible Entry/Flexible Exit Curriculum Adaptation project are to: 1) build capacity of CCBC's Process Technology program to educate the technician workforce needed in the tristate region; 2) increase program accessibility for non-traditional students and incumbent workers from the Appalachian Region interested in an associate degree in process technology; and 3) increase collaboration between education and industry within the tristate region. The project plans to use a flipped-hybrid, competency-based delivery model that is detached from the traditional semester framework.  It is expected that this flexible model will permit the College to institute an ""every day is a new class start"" approach that will increase accessibility of the program to diverse groups of students.  Each current PTEC technical course will be modularized into multiple one-credit courses.  Each one-credit course will consist of an online component, corresponding hands-on requirements, and one or more hands-on assessments.  Each one-credit course will be self-paced, and faculty will support learners by serving as success coaches as the students complete the online and hands-on requirements.  Learners will schedule the final hands-on assessment of each course with faculty, when the learners are ready and it fits in their schedules.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
