Each FLC is developing a sustainable plan for increasing the use of evidence-based practices that have been proven in both the national literature and in NCC practice to positively impact student success. The FLCs are exploring inquiry-based learning, experiential learning, and modified STEM student learning communities in math and science gateway courses. FLCs are each developing a plan that reflects the unique institutional culture of each campus and presenting the plans to college administration for implementation. Each FLC member is working on an individual project to improve learning in a STEM gateway course that he or she is teaching, and the group members are collectively sharing their knowledge and accomplishments with the wider college and STEM community.<br/> <br/>Community colleges face unique barriers to scaling up high impact strategies. Many have not yet adopted an institution-wide culture of evidence-based decision making. Moreover, the heavy teaching loads of community college faculty inhibit their ability to research and implement reforms, yet they are the very group who must implement the reforms. The change strategies being implemented include faculty learning communities and strategic planning. Lessons learned from this project are impacting the outcomes of nearly half the nation's STEM students by adding to the body of knowledge on the effect of increased use of inquiry based learning, experiential learning, and learning communities on student learning, especially for members of underrepresented groups."

However, limited attention is given to the impact these differences have on their college experience. This project is built upon the substantial body of research confirming that classroom and campus climate have a major influence on the recruitment and retention of underrepresented students in STEM. For example, women and other underrepresented groups are more likely to choose and be retained in a STEM major when there is a high degree of social capital, robust experiential learning, culturally-competent academic support, and the use of critical pedagogy that incorporates a multicultural approach to teaching. This project aims to develop a culturally-responsive Information Security associate degree program that is responsive to students' life experiences and the skills needed by industry.  This project can provide a foundation on which Northampton Community College and other community colleges can advance strategies that broaden participation in STEM careers, particularly in the skilled technical workforce. <br/><br/>The project includes a three-year comprehensive plan to achieve: 1) an enhanced Information Security associate degree program curriculum that is aligned with Center of Academic Excellence 2-Year designation requirements and regional workforce needs; 2) a recruitment plan that attracts underrepresented students into the cyber security field; 3) a retention plan that supports completion, transfer, career placement and/or advancement; and 4) a faculty/staff recruitment plan that meets future enrollment needs by incorporating strategies to develop qualified and culturally-competent computer science faculty. The project has the potential to illustrate the positive impacts of collaborations between STEM faculty and the Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Specifically, the project may demonstrate that educating a globally competitive skilled technical workforce requires both an industry-driven curriculum and improvements to the educational outcomes of underrepresented students.  In addition, it has the potential to demonstrate that a culturally competent learning environment and student support system can improve student success in highly technical fields such as cyber security. Thus, project outcomes will provide information that can be used by educational institutions that are struggling to enroll, engage, retain, and graduate diverse student populations in STEM fields.  This project is funded by the NSF Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program is working to address the financial, academic, and emotional barriers that can prove formidable for all students and often affect traditionally underrepresented students most significantly. Scholars are supported as a ""Community of Learners"" through participation in a summer retreat, learning circles by discipline, common courses, and other cohort building activities. A high level of academic support is provided by a Student Success Specialist, tutors, career advisors, faculty and industrial mentors, experiential learning opportunities and workshops to develop leadership and soft skills.  <br/><br/>""SMaRT Scholars for Success"" provides a model for increasing the recruitment, retention, and success rate of students underrepresented in STEM disciplines. Most of the strategies used in this project can be implemented at modest cost to a comparable institution. With community colleges accounting for 46% of the nation's undergraduates and over half of all minorities in higher education, the project offers the opportunity for broad impact on the STEM pipeline."

All scholars enroll in a learning community that includes tutors, student success specialists, and faculty. Along with financial and academic supports, the SMaRT Scholars program also integrates student service and peer support structures. These components are designed to help the SMaRT Scholar develop an image of him or herself as a successful participant in a community of scientists, engineers, technicians, and mathematicians. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project has three objectives. <br/>(1) Through a coordinated, intensive high school recruitment program, the college is providing scholarships annually to financially disadvantaged, academically talented students, thus increasing the number of full-time STEM majors by 15%. <br/>(2) At least 80% of participants are successfully completing the required first semester mathematics courses (College Algebra and Calculus), which have traditionally had high failure rates. <br/>(3) The college is providing 100% of SMaRT Scholars who successfully complete coursework transfer or job placement assistance, depending on the individual scholar''s goals. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project comprehensively addresses financial, academic, and emotional barriers to student success in STEM disciplines. By building a strong cohort of scholars, as well as a community of supportive mentors around the cohort, the SMaRT Scholars for Success program works to address student feelings and emotional barriers that can prove significant for all students, and often impact traditionally underrepresented students most significantly. With this project, the college is implementing and disseminating a model that can help to overcome all three categories of barriers."
