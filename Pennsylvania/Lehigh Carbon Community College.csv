One barrier faced by prospective STEM majors is the failure to successfully complete the mathematics requirements. To address the mathematics barrier that impedes students' persistence and success in STEM associate degree technician programs, Lehigh Carbon Community College (LCCC) will redesign Intermediate Algebra and College Algebra to answer the question students continually ask: ""Why do I need math?""<br/><br/>Mathematics faculty will work with an advisory committee of faculty and industry professionals from various engineering, technology, computing, and science fields to develop real-world applications that mimic those encountered in industry. Through multi-disciplinary, collaborative, and discovery-based learning, the students will increase their awareness of the relevance of algebra to STEM disciplines. It is expected that the revised mathematics courses will support an increase in the percentage of STEM students successfully passing algebra courses, and increase fall-to-fall retention in targeted STEM technician programs. The project has the potential to positively affect the teaching of algebra beyond LCCC. A professional development program will provide workshops for LCCC's full-time, part-time, and adjunct faculty and faculty at other colleges in the region and for secondary instructors who teach dual enrollment college algebra for high school students seeking college credit. Participants will receive kits of instructional materials to take back to their classrooms. A project website will be created to share the course materials and project results, and materials developed will be archived with ATE Central.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students majoring in science, engineering, mathematics, computing, drafting, industrial automation, electronics technology, electrical technology, mechanical technology, and nanofabrication technology will participate as a cohort in structured activities to motivate them to persist in their STEM programs. These activities will include one-on-one mentoring with STEM faculty, orientation, monthly meetings featuring integrated learning labs, mathematics support, student-facilitated study groups, S-STEM buddies, presentations by professionals, workshops, field trips, STEM Club, and job/transfer fairs. Students will be required to create and maintain ePortfolios to record their goals, artifacts of coursework and activities, and ongoing reflections of their personal and professional development. The goal of the Start SMART program is to produce skilled graduates prepared to enter the STEM workforce. <br/><br/>A research study will determine the correlation between the project's evidence-based strategies and the attributes of growth mindset, grit, goal orientation, self-regulation, and STEM momentum predicted to lead to academic success for community college students in STEM programs. The use of ePortfolios will serve a three-fold purpose: (1) enhancing student learning by helping them make connections across courses and activities; (2) enabling students to share their experiences and connect with each other and faculty; and (3) measuring STEM momentum through an analysis of students' artifacts and reflections. Integrative learning experiences will expand students' knowledge of other disciplines and instill professional skills necessary for the workplace. Research questions are: 1) To what extent do the non-cognitive variables of growth mindset, grit, goal orientation, and self-regulation change over the duration of the program? 2) Is there a correlation between the project activities and the non-cognitive variables that are predictive of student outcomes? 3) Is successful completion of the first mathematics course in the first year associated with STEM momentum? 4) To what extent does the ePortfolio demonstrate STEM momentum? Findings from the research study will expand on the concept of STEM momentum as it relates to community college students."

In this new project, the STEM education and workforce pipeline is strengthened in several ways. Workshops are being offered to train educators and pre-service teachers to design and develop tabletop educational game prototypes using an ""Edugaming"" framework to enhance STEM classroom education and student engagement. After the workshops these prototypes are then computerized through a collaboration of community college students in the Computer Game and Simulation Development major with the teachers from the workshops. This collaboration provides unique internship experiences for the students in which they hone their communication, teamwork, and project management skills. The final computerized games are played by K-12 students to strengthen their classroom learning. The players of the games are immersed in STEM concepts, encouraging further exploration of the topics and promoting interest in STEM careers. The community college student field experience through the student-teacher collaborations and the structured framework for developing educational games are models that are being disseminated through the project website, ATE centers, publications, and conferences to reach broader audiences. In addition, annual regional conferences are being held to bring together game industry representatives, STEM educators, and students to engage in conversations leading to the development of additional educational game curricula and learning experiences that increase the number of students entering STEM fields.<br/><br/>The project's evaluation plan is assessing: how the project influences the community college and secondary students' career choices and their interest in STEM; the instructional effectiveness of the prototype board games and the associated computerized games that are developed; the path of community college students who graduate, tracking how many continue on to a bachelor degree program (and whether  in STEM) and how many go directly into the workforce (and whether the jobs are STEM-related); and on the effectiveness of the regional conferences across all participants."
