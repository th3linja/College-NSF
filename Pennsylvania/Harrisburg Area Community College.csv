Often these students elect to take college algebra which neither prepares them for a data oriented environment in the workplace nor exposes them to scientific methodology.  These students, who typically comprise one-half of the enrollment in college algebra in many colleges, need an interdisciplinary course which will provide them with the requisite skills and knowledge.  Further, such a course should provide a sound foundation for continued course work in mathematics, including applied calculus, and should address the learning styles of students historically underrepresented in the sciences and technology.  This project is developing a laboratory manual and textbook for an interdisciplinary course in quantitative and scientific literacy.  In this laboratory course, data collected by the students is being analyzed to determine both the scientific principles it illustrates and the properties of the function category for which the data is a numerical representation.  The project is providing an avenue to ensure that an increasing number of non-science majors will have the requisite skills and knowledge that will enable them to be competitive in their careers and successful in their lives."

The infrastructure connecting HACCís science and technology programs at two physical locations and to the Internet is limited to 100Mbps. At each of these connection points, HACC is replacing switch equipment, core routing equipment and the wide area network (WAN) connection. To support large science datasets and their flow across the network, HACC must re-architect the network infrastructure and redesign the virtual local area network (VLAN) architecture. This redesign of the VLAN architecture supports segmentation of the science and learning programs, including Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Computer Information Systems (CIS), and allows these programs to be situated on their own 1Gbps VLAN connections with expanded science and technology classroom connectivity from 100 Mbps to 1Gbps.<br/><br/>As a result of this project, HACC students and faculty will have access to online educational materials in one place, accessible from anywhere, and the ability to learn remotely and use time on campus efficiently. This project supports the implementation of HACC's science and technology symposia, current and potential grant-funded projects, service and research projects and mobile learning course-content production. HACC will be better able to prepare an educated workforce for Pennsylvania's key industries, including energy, technology, manufacturing and agribusiness. This model can be a foundation for HACC's other campuses and other regional institutions to implement similar projects and programs to support STEM education."

The course is precisely bringing a scientific context and perspective into a course alternative to college algebra for business and social science majors.  It is providing the requisite mathematical background for the analysis and modeling of experimental data, is offering a significant laboratory science component in which students collect data to be analyzed, and is teaching the development of basic science laws.  This course is providing an avenue to ensure that non-science-majors have the requisite data analysis skills and basic science knowledge to enable them to be competitive in their careers."

To meet the                           instructional goals, the laboratory is equipped with twenty-                    four workstations linked in a token ring network managed by a                   network server that will maintain commercial software and                       exercises developed by the faculty.   The networked system                      provides a wide range of problem solving and graphing                           capabilities.   The laboratory provides the faculty with a new                  instructional vehicle and affords the student the opportunity                   to practice math skills in a non-traditional manner and explore                 mathematics beyond normal limits in an efficient, non-                          threatening environment.
