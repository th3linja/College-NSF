Students are involved in computer-controlled experimentation in chemistry and physics laboratory classes; industry or university-level lab experiences in chemistry, physics, and electronics engineering technology; hands-on experiences in transducer design and construction for electronics engineering majors; and chemistry laboratory experiences involving gas chromatography."
