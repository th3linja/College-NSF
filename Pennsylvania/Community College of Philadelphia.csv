Students learn the materials needed for engineering practice and retention in the program.  In the traditional curriculum, students learn much of this material by rote memorization without putting it into practice.  This project also enhaces the national need to recruit more minority students into SMET.  As a large, comprehensive urban community college, successful adaption of this program will serve as a model for other community colleges.<br/><br/>E4 calls for the design, development and testing of an engineering core curriculum emphasizing interdisciplinary sicentific foundations:  the pivotal role of experimentation; the transcendent role of the computer; the imperative for superior communication skills; the importance of teamwork and the habit of vigorous life-long learning; and the role of design as the defining element of professional practice.  This proposal addresses the DUE themes of faculty development, diversity, and integration of technology into education.<br/><br/>E4 and ETDSL will be adapted to an urban, community college seytting through: (1) the development of two new courses using the E4 aproach and the simulation laboratory; (2) the revision of four existing courses to utilize the the ETSDL approach; (3) a provision of faculty development on E4 and ETSDL; (4) retention of 80% of disadvantaged students in the engineering major by providing a positive educational experience to the students enrolled or interested in engineering; and (5) initiation of two addtional articulation agreements with four years schools offering a baccalaureate in engineering."

Working with an advisory board made up of representatives from hospitals, clinics, health systems and educational institutions in the greater Philadelphia area, the Community College of Philadelphia (CCP) will establish a program in Biomedical Equipment Technology (BMET).   The BMET program will provide students with multiple entry and exit points by offering a curriculum composed of two stackable (sequential) proficiency certificates that can lead to attainment of an associate's degree.  Students will be prepared for direct entry into the workforce by completing either of the proficiency certificates or the associate's degree.  Graduates of the associate's degree program will also be qualified for transfer into a baccalaureate program.  One particularly key transfer pathway option is the bachelor's program in Biomedical Engineering Technology at Drexel University, also located in Philadelphia and one of the academic institutions participating on the BMET program advisory board.   As CCP is a Predominantly Black Institution, the BMET program will enhance STEM workforce diversity.<br/><br/>The project will advance knowledge and understanding in the emerging field of BMET education through the development and evaluation of the program, with its two stackable proficiency certificates and associate's degree options.  Establishing the BMET program will include modernizing an existing curriculum for an Electronics Engineering Technology program by infusing learning experiences that emulate the highly networked environment of medical equipment, medical devices and computers in hospitals and other healthcare environments.  Program development will include creating the four new courses of Digital Electronics, Semiconductor Devices, Medical Devices and Medical Devices in a Networked Environment. Through formal coursework, laboratory exercises and internships, students in the BMET program will gain hands-on experiences with state-of-the-art medical equipment and devices.  Project outcomes will be evaluated by utilizing a variety of methods.  Institutional data gathered from course level student learning outcomes and the annual Quality and Viability Indicators review that all CCP program undergo will be combined with appraisal by the advisory board to evaluate the impact of the program on students and the institution.  Surveys of employers and tracking of program graduates will provide information regarding the impact of the program to provide students pathways into technical career and in meeting the needs of the workforce."

It reduces questions about ""any"" function to the           same question about a power function, which appears in the                      approximating polynomial.                                                                                                                                       This two semester course will be equivalent to pre-calculus and one             semester of calculus.  The first semester will consist of linear                approximations, quadratic, and power functions.  The second semester            will consist of the differential study of polynomials, Laurent                  polynomials, rational and elementary transcendental functions by                Lagrange's approach.

The Steering Committee also proposed innovative student support systems including learning communities, collaborative learning and supplemental instruction to assist our diverse student body to be successful in preparing for careers in science, math and technology.    To implement the proposed curriculum, a group of faculty will identify common themes, curricular materials, and pedagogical methods (based on prior innovations in science, math and technology) that will enhance students' understanding of the interactive and complex relationship between culture and technology.   CCP anticipates enrolling 3,400 students and training 150 faculty over the proposed three- year developmental period. The College is making a major in-kind contribution to the development of the curriculum and is committed to the program's continuation at the close of the funding period, as well as extensive evaluation and dissemination of results. Due to the size of CCP and diversity of our student body, our proposed curriculum would serve as a model for two-year schools struggling to develop a curriculum involving a systematic study of the natural sciences, related technology and their interrelationship with a changing society."

Two new courses and educational materials focused on inquiry-based, hands-on learning, are being developed for prospective teachers: Teaching with Technology and Problem-Solving in Math and Science. Both courses explore the use of technology to investigate authentic problems in math and science. Students develop a portfolio of problem-based learning scenarios using technology appropriate for use in their future professional practice. The project addresses the International Society for Technology in Education standards for preservice preparation in technology. The project also includes customized systems of advising and mentoring; recruitment of prospective teachers from mathematics and science courses; learning communities; an education student club; and faculty development workshops.<br/>"
