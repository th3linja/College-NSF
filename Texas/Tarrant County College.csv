Programs being developed fill the educational gap that exists between the FAA's minimum requirements for certification and licensure and the aviation industry's requirement for ongoing and advanced education. As the need to maintain the nation's vastly different aircraft continues to evolve, expand, and become more complex (including smart metals, advanced composites, advanced engine technologies, and anti-terrorist equipment), the aviation industry partners and the colleges involved are identifying and setting the standards for aviation maintenance technician education and certification programs. These programs are becoming the tools through which the individual aviation maintenance technician meets or upgrades his or her current and future education, training, and certification requirements.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit for this project is the development of (1) world class, industry-driven, aircraft technician education programs that provide formal updating of curriculum, certification processes, and standards for aircraft maintenance technicians; and (2) partnerships between the FAA's Aviation Education Program, the Experimental Aircraft Association's Aeroscholars Program, and educational partners that establish K-12 articulation programs with postsecondary institutions; thus reforming aviation-grounded technology education in the United States, and fostering interest in associated science, mathematics, and technology fields. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this Center are through the following: <br/>(1) Partnering aviation colleges and other participating aviation academic institutions are provided a strategy for introduction, dissemination, and inclusion of a new educational core curriculum for aviation maintenance technicians. <br/>(2) Academic institutions have an opportunity to update programs and curriculum.<br/>(3) Partner institutions compete with best- in-class standards for aircraft technician education. <br/>(4) Students receive nationally recognized competencies and certification for employment. <br/>(5) Business and industry receive a better-educated work force with a curriculum that is adaptable for continued life-long learning. <br/>(6) The project serves as a national resource to strengthen our country's technical education base.<br/>(7) Thousands of current civilian electronics and avionics technicians receive certification for education previously accomplished in military and civilian education programs.<br/>(8) U.S. military electronics and avionics technicians certify their military education prior to separation from service.<br/>"

The approach is to create a formal link between the University of Texas at Arlington and two local community colleges (Tarrant County College-Southeast Campus and Mountain View College) to tap a rich pool of academically talented students who lack the financial resources to complete their studies on a full-time basis. First generation students, in particular, tend to fall into this category, and they often lack the visibility or knowledge to seek needed resources and career guidance effectively. Many of these students begin their higher education at community colleges, while working full- or part-time. Lack of funds negatively affects the retention rate of this group, thus shortchanging the technical workforce of much-needed potential talent.<br/><br/>Therefore, UTA and its CC partners formed a CSEMS collaborative partnership that could have a tremendous impact on the Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) technical workforce. Eighty-nine scholarships are awarded annually with priority given to eligible first generation students.<br/><br/>The objectives to support the goal include establishing a structured pipeline from the CCs to<br/>UTA; developing retention strategies and adapting existing academic support resources<br/>to target this pool of students in CSEM disciplines; formalizing an optional research component or industry internship experience to the Scholars' degree plan; and developing CSEM specific programs to prepare the students for professional experiences beyond graduation. Faculty and industry mentors are available, and a Peer Bridge Group of CC alumni, who are now attending UTA, assist CC students through the transfer process.<br/><br/>A formal CSEM Articulation Agreement was developed to create seamless curricula and concurrent enrollment opportunities in these fields by which to transition CC students to UTA. This collaborative encompasses a significant portion of North Texas, and it builds capacity and critical mass for the technical workforce in this leading high tech region.<br/>"

The student audience includes  non-science and allied health majors, with women comprising 78% of  this population.  A three-pronged approach to laboratory  instruction is being employed: (1) Standard hands-on laboratories  of a conventional type, (2) Mixtures of hands-on laboratories and  interactive multimedia software, and (3) Computer-enhanced  laboratories.  Intelitool and A.D.A.M software is being employed  with IBM compatible computers.  Results of the project will be  reported at the Texas Junior College Teacher Association Convention  and to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board in Austin,  Texas.  Information will also be disseminated by the publication of  a scholarly paper.  Evaluation will primarily be based on data  collected on-line from statistically proven questionnaires  administered over the length of the project."

However, as aircraft have become increasingly electronics driven, a career path has evolved for technicians specializing in troubleshooting, maintenance and repair of aircraft electrical and integrated flight systems. National standards, curricula and regulatory oversight presently do not exist for Avionics Technicians.  While the FAA recognizes this gap, it has not filled it.  Industry, labor and education have come together, with participation and support from the FAA, to fill this void in an effort to meet the workforce development needs of aircraft manufacturers, component manufacturers, airlines, and repair stations throughout the United States. <br/> <br/><br/>"

In these earlier projects the investigators developed standards, curricula, and certification testing for four of the areas (aircraft electronics, navigation systems, communication systems, and avionics and electronics system installation and integration), and they are completing the remaining ones on the current project. In doing this, they are establishing aviation industry defined and endorsed avionics and electronics standards; developing and publishing curriculum with lesson plans and student study guides for each standard; and establishing an industry recognized certification program for avionics and electronics technicians.  The investigators also have a K-12 outreach initiative that involves summer workshops for teachers and counselors, FAA Aviation Career Education (ACE) Academy workshops, and a shared program with American Airlines C.R. Smith Museum.  All the educational materials are available to secondary schools nationally.  Evaluation, being conducted by independent evaluators, involves pre and post tests and structured interviews to monitor progress toward the project's outcomes.  The investigators are disseminating their work through presentations and exhibits at major aviation conferences and trade shows, through journal publications, and through an on-line newsletter.  Broader impacts include the dissemination of the developed material and the  K-12 outreach programs."
