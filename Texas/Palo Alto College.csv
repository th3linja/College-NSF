The project combines scholarship support, faculty mentoring, and peer tutoring with Projects of Discovery (PODs), a course-based approach to involving community college students in interdisciplinary research. This method of instruction, involving both STEM and non-STEM classes, is expected to improve students' self-efficacy, making it more likely that students will persist in their major. PAC is a federally designated Hispanic Serving Institution, and this work will provide significant insights into recruiting and retaining HSI students into STEM careers.<br/><br/>This project aims to increase the number of academically talented biology and bioscience majors who transfer from a community college and graduate with a bachelor's degree in a STEM field within six years.  Integrating research on the best practices in persistence and retention strategies for Hispanic STEM majors, the project will address key academic, cognitive, and socio-cultural factors that influence Hispanic students' success in STEM degree attainment and will advance understanding of these issues while promoting teaching, training, and learning through faculty mentorship, peer interactions, and cohort building activities. The PODs developed will require only minor changes to established course modules and will assist other community colleges in implementing similar PODs-based research opportunities to support STEM majors in gaining the self-confidence, science identity, and cognitive skills that undergraduate research experiences provide. The knowledge generation activities will examine how course-based undergraduate research opportunities engage students at a Hispanic-Serving Institution, and improve persistence and completion outcomes at a Hispanic-Serving community college."

A shortage of qualified L/SC technicians has resulted in a growing workforce gap of six available jobs for every currently employed skilled worker. Industry officials have linked the workforce shortage to five key factors: increasing demand for new L/SC talent, L/SC talent gaps, changing dynamics of supply chains, limited capacity to educate and train new talent, and the poor image of the profession with the millennial workforce. To meet industry needs, community colleges must work collaboratively with industry partners to revise current L/SC programs or develop new programs that prepare the next generation of L/SC professionals. This project at Palo Alto College (San Antonio, Texas) aims to better serve the specific L/SC workforce education needs of regional businesses and industries.  The program aims to: increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics content and technical training in its L/SC programs; increase L/SC student enrollment; improve L/SC student technical skills and STEM knowledge; and improve L/SC educational and workforce pipelines. The project will combine an L/SC industry workforce assessment with research on the career expectations of millennial students. By appealing to the millennials' interest in new technologies and leveraging the evolving technological landscape of supply chains, the project has the potential to change the perception of L/SC careers among millennial students.  As a result, a new generation of workers can be recruited into an industry with national and global importance. Because Palo Alto College is a Hispanic Serving Institution and the dual credit partner school districts have a majority Hispanic student population, an additional outcome of this project is the potential to diversify the L/SC industry.  It also will serve a student group that is typically underrepresented in STEM education and training. The program will include hands-on technology-based lesson modules, mini-case competitions, recruitment efforts, industry internships, and development of an active student organization.  <br/><br/>The overall objective of the project is to create a high school to two-year to four-year L/SC educational pipeline, while incorporating robotics and other emerging supply chain technologies into the program curriculum. The project aims to educate and train more qualified (L/SC) technicians to meet workforce needs by: (1) conducting an industry review of the college Logistics associate degree and certificates, (2) creating four L/SC emerging technology course modules; (3) establishing a dual credit programs with three high schools (Southside, Southwest Legacy, and Veterans Memorial) where students can earn an L/SC associate degree; (4) conducting targeted recruitment activities to educate students about L/SC careers; (5) creating a Discover Logistics training module for secondary school educators; and (6) establishing a transfer agreement between Palo Alto College and the Texas A&M San Antonio (TAMUSA) four-year L/SC program. The project also plans to create and host an annual L/SC mini-case competition for partner high schools. STEM-based recruitment activities will strive to serve more than 1,000 high school students, while the dual credit program and course modules will aim to serve an estimated 150 high school students and 100 L/SC college students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The introduction of mandatory mathematics laboratories as an integral part of selected courses is viewed as one significant way to increase the success and retention rate of developmental mathematics students. The purpose of this project is to integrate a graphical, numerical, and analytical approach in teaching selected developmental mathematics courses taught at the college. For this purpose, the project's specific objectives are to adapt and synthesize methods from other successful reform efforts in teaching of developmental mathematics; modify these methods to meet the needs of a diverse student population; and utilize various commercial and locally available or developed software to support the delivery of mathematics instruction. This project secures the necessary laboratory equipment to expand and modernize the old laboratory so as to permit the incorporation of mandatory mathematics laboratories into the Basic Mathematics course and the Introduction to Algebra and Geometry course; provides faculty development activities to all instructors and laboratory assistants on the use of the new equipment, software, and instructional methods; provides additional mathematics instruction (an added 2 laboratory hours per week), in a laboratory environment, for our students which emphasizes graphical and numerical techniques, as well as more traditional methods. With this project, the number of computers in the mathematics laboratory increases from 24 workstations to 78 workstations connected to a network supported by three servers. The expanded laboratory has the capacity to support approximately 1,300 students who enroll in these two developmental courses each semester, and is available to another 3,000 enrolled in other mathematics courses."
