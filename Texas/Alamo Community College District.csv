The project is ensuring an environment which fosters  inventive curricular revision and faculty development; increasing  the productivity of education and training by using computer-based  multimedia and telelearning systems; expanding resources for  innovations; empowering all faculty and students to learn how to  learn, and expanding collaboration between regional alliances.  The application of the paradigm is being accomplished through a  long-term, comprehensive, systematic restructuring process which  involves secondary school teachers; two-year and four-year college  and university faculty; administrators; practicing scientists and  engineers; business and industry representatives; community and  governmental agencies; and professional organizations.  The  following goals form the core initiatives of the South Texas  Advanced Technological Education Center: (a) develop of model  curricula which reflect both integration and application of  concepts within the real-life/work-related context of a dynamic  global society; (b) establish a faculty enhancement program which  provides faculty with development options so that they can become  the force behind curricular changes and innovations; (c) create a  student outreach and support program which recruits, retains, and  supports underrepresented populations for science, mathematics, and  technological careers; (d) broaden collaborative endeavors with  present partners and increase efforts to forge new regional  partnerships; and (e) support a teaching and learning environment  which incorporates state-of-the-art equipment for laboratories and  multimedia and telelearning technology in the classroom."

The goal is to increase the numbers of Mathematics scholars who enter the workforce or transfer to a university following completion of an associate degree. Project objectives include: (1) recruit, select and award eligible MS 2015 Scholars with scholarships, (2) retain MS 2015 Scholars utilizing enrichment activities including study group sessions, scholars hour, faculty mentoring, academic advising, attendance at conferences, internships, and field trips with university and industry partners, and (3) ensure Scholars enrolled in MS 2015 earn an associate degree and either secure employment with the support of the College career placement services, or pursue a baccalaureate degree with support of the College Transfer Services. Scholars also have the opportunity to gain real life experiences in STEM fields through Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)/Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP), employer job shadowing, and internships. The project targets primarily underrepresented groups. Project results are widely disseminated to share results and emerging innovations."

Analysis by the curriculum committee has indicated that students in these courses find the cell biology component especially difficult. Attempts to improve performance in this area by utilization of an after-class study center and additional cell biology laboratory activities have proven to be inadequate. Through this project, a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) laboratory is being developed. The laboratory consists of 24 networked stations plus an instructor's station. The prior five hands-on laboratories are also being equipped with one computerized station that permits integration of ""wet"" laboratory activities with computer-assisted activities. A series of interactive software titles have been closed and cover all aspects of the syllabus topics in cell biology."

GIS courses also support two occupational /technical programs Engineering Technology and Computer-Aided Drafting /Design. The objectives of the project include refining the curriculum of the two GIS courses; providing students with hands-on laboratory activities to facilitate learning of GIS principles; preparing and training faculty with the theoretical foundation and technical skills to teach GIS; and using the two GIS courses as the foundation for a comprehensive GIS program and to support occupational/technical programs. The evaluation plan includes both process evaluation and outcome evaluation components that will use qualitative and quantitative techniques to evaluate the project and faculty/student outcomes. *"
