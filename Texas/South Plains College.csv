The instrumentation is                         centered around the electrophoresis procedure which is used to                  chemically separate DNA fragments and proteins.  The major                      equipment items are electrophoresis chambers, power supplies,                   digital pipets, and a gel imaging system.  Students have hands-                 on use of this equipment and produce a written lab report which                 includes a section relating the laboratory activities with                      actual applications in use in the fields of biology, medicine,                  and forensics."
