This is being accomplished by introducing a series of new experiences in the laboratory utilizing microcomputer-based laboratories, activities, and new experiments in mechanics. These laboratory experiences are in the areas of kinematics, forces, rotational motion, energy, and simple harmonic motion. Using some of the MBL results of Thornton and Laws with some results done at Lee College, a new laboratory curriculum is being developed that is integrating new technologies with proven activities and experiments. Microcomputers are being used to perform data collection, analysis, and graphing; and are being used to construct, execute, and display physical simulations in mechanics.The support is provided for software and hardware for six, networked, color Macintosh IIsi workstations equipped with a Universal Lab Interface with appropriate sensors and probes. Support is also provided for a laser printer, CD reader, scanner, and some laboratory equipment.This project is encouraging students to continue study in physics or to support science by improving their experiences in physics, to increase science literacy, to help prepare Lee College's physics courses for the next century, and to stimulate other two-year and four-year colleges to adapt this approach for their needs."

Such technicians not only need to have specific technical knowledge, but also a strong base in physics knowledge so they have the competence to recognize, formulate, document, and solve real problems now and in the future; as well as deploy new technology. Typically, this core knowledge and problem solving capability related to physics is expected to be obtained in mostly conventional physics courses taught in high schools (HS) and/or two-year colleges (TYC) by traditionally trained, physics educators with limited support and heavy workload demands. These courses are generally isolated from technical education specialists and focus on few workforce issues. Frequently, these physics courses do not provide the foundational physics knowledge base or the activities that build and enhance workforce physics related problem solving. This situation can be improved by supplying the physics faculty at HSs and TYCs the tools that produce a more competent and competitive workforce.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This project is providing a series of three-day, intensive, focused, hands-on professional and curriculum development workshops/conferences and follow-up activities for physics teachers in TYCs and HSs who serve students involved in technology-based or technician careers.
