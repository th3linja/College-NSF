The project includes three major activities: 1) curriculum and educational materials development; 2) professional development for educators; and 3) program development and improvement. The main goal of the BUENO Project is to build the first biotechnology program in the region to enhance the employability of technicians in biotechnology-related fields.  The BUENO Project has the potential to provide a framework that can be duplicated at other minority 2- year and 4-year community colleges and universities. Moreover, through the partnership between Texas Southmost College and local school districts, the Project can build sustained efforts to align college readiness and the college curriculum in biotechnological fields of study. This alignment can help to ensure preparation of employees to meet the community's workforce demands.<br/> <br/>Through the BUENO Project, Texas Southmost College aims to increase student learning by developing a new biotechnology program of study, providing professional development for teacher improvement, and offering the most up-to-date curriculum and educational materials possible. Data collected as part of the evaluation plan will be critical for identifying strategies and activities that can be modified to improve project outcomes and student learning, as well as student and instructor competency and confidence, especially at a Hispanic-Serving Institution. Furthermore, the BUENO Project contribute new curricular materials that will be especially useful at minority institutions, as well as insight concerning which activities and interventions are most effective in promoting the success of Hispanics and veterans in biotechnology and related STEM fields.  These contributions will add to the body of knowledge about effective science education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The apparatus is down sized and               experiments are carried out on a scale one-tenth to one-thousandth of           the scale previously employed.  The microscale technique is an entirely         new way of doing the undergraduate organic chemistry laboratory:                everything on a very small scale.  Among the many advantages of this            technique is a strong instrumental focus, infrared spectrometry and gas         chromatography.  Switching from the traditional approach to the                 microscale technique cannot be accomplished without ready access to             these important instrumental techniques.  Along with using the infrared         spectrometer and the GC for product characterization in most of their           experimental work, the students learn the theory behind these two               important instrumental techniques.                                                                                                                              The institution is matching the grant with an equal amount of funds."
