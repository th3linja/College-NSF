In collaboration with industry partners, this project at Lone Star College University Park (LSC-UP) in Texas entitled Advanced PLC, Robotics, and Networking is designed to better prepare technicians to operate and maintain modern factory machines and work in the digital plant of the future, thus enhancing the employability of graduates and developing a diverse, globally competitive science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce. Project activities will include curriculum and educational materials development, the evaluation of curriculum, and dissemination of the knowledge gained. It will assist employees as they become more employable and are trained on cutting edge industry standard equipment. This will allow future employees to enhance their personal well-being and that of their families while increasing the economic competiveness of the United States by ensuring that employee education and training keeps pace with employer demand and is aligned with industry skill needs. The knowledge obtained from this project will allow for the dissemination of industry driven curricula to transform the education and training of technicians to account for advancing technology and lead to long term enhanced technician education at the college as the courses are institutionalized through the Energy & Manufacturing Institute. The curricula will be disseminated through a paper for publication, conference presentations, and submission to the Workforce Education Course Manual (WECM), impacting the education of technicians at higher education institutions across the state and the country.<br/><br/>To address the industry needs for a multi-skilled technician to work in the manufacturing plant of the future that will rely heavily on integrated and intelligent ecosystems that use real-time and historical data to run efficiently and safely, the college will stack computer networking courses upon their current Mechatronics Technician education and training programs. Two new Mechatronics courses will be developed to incorporate computer networking to better prepare technicians for the modern digital plant. These new networking courses will provide students with the knowledge, skills, and competencies necessary to utilize the distributed control systems used to control manufacturing processes that are continuous or batch-oriented as well as the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems used for remote monitoring and control in technical workplaces. This project will advance knowledge regarding technician education and training by identifying the emerging needs of employers hiring graduates of Mechatronics programs. The curricula will be evaluated by industry partners to ascertain its compliance with the current and projected needs of the occupations supported by Mechatronics programs, such as engineering technicians, process technicians, and mechatronics technicians."

The goal of the team is increasing students' knowledge and enhancing their demonstrated skills in troubleshooting; with the objective of improving safety, impact on the environment, and efficiency in the energy industry.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there have been a number of accidents during the past few years as evidenced by the investigative studies conducted by the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB). A recent scan within the broader energy industry revealed incidents in the oil and gas, power generation, ethanol production, and biodiesel production sectors. Thus, the ability to enhance troubleshooting skills is needed for the nation to develop a highly competent energy workforce, maintain the consistent production of energy, lessen the dependence on foreign energy sources and contribute to the security and safety of the energy facilities.  <br/><br/>In response to this need, the partnership is designing, developing and implementing 18 generic equipment scenarios and 16 process/system-specific troubleshooting instructional modules for energy technicians that can either be: 1) used as stand-alone modules or 2) integrated into a capstone course for college students. The modules are providing students with an opportunity to acquire relevant troubleshooting knowledge and skills that prepare them to handle process upsets while working in the energy industry. Furthermore, students are able to showcase their acquired troubleshooting skills during a simulator competition.<br/><br/><br/>BROADER SIGNIFICANCE <br/>This effort is having a significant impact by: (1) providing professional development for subject matter experts from colleges and industry to ensure competency in designing/developing instructional materials and teaching troubleshooting modules; (2) promoting national security and energy independence by providing a highly skilled and educated energy technician workforce; and (3) disseminating insights on students' critical thinking and troubleshooting skills to the education community. The project's influence covers a large geographical area; while the developed modules can be easily used in community college settings as well as industrial in-house training programs."

This project evaluates a model recruitment program that is aimed at attracting students from diverse populations into biotechnology associate degree programs, with the objective of moving students toward successful careers in the field. In order to address the demand for a 21st century workforce in biotechnology, the project partners this community college with Lexicon Genetics, Inc. and high school teachers and students at the Conroe Independent School District. It employs recruitment and career awareness programs designed to catch the attention of underrepresented populations, especially from the Hispanic community. This effort includes: (1) using Biotechnology Clubs in high schools as a novel recruitment tool, (2) building a career-awareness program that employs ethnically matched role models, community dialog and recruitment materials in Spanish and English; (3) offering core biotechnology courses at more accessible times and locations; and (4) providing professional development opportunities for biotechnology educators at the secondary and community college level. The methods used in this project are being evaluated for transferability to other biotechnology programs unable to meet recruitment goals, thereby developing a strategy with possible nation-wide implications."
