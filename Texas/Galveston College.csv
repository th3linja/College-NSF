The honors program will develop academic and nonacademic skills using curricular and co-curricular initiatives, to increase student success at Galveston College and after transfer to a four-year institution. The study abroad program, with opportunities typically not available to STEM community college students, will to develop students into a more globally literate STEM workforce. The S-STEM Scholars at Galveston College will financially support 52 students for two years. <br/><br/>To study the impact of the Honors, Study Abroad, and Scholars Programs, a mixed method research and evaluation approach will be employed. The investigators will measure a number of variables including financial support, workload, and participation in co-curricular activities. This approach will allow the investigators to make evidence-based improvements to better achieve, sustain, and share successes. The programs are designed to (1) broaden participation in STEM fields at the community college level; (2) be sustainable at Galveston College; and (3) be replicable at similar institutions."

This project at Galveston College (GC), a two-year Hispanic-serving community and technical college, is designed to advance desired societal outcomes through increased gainful employment for graduates and economic growth of employers.  The goal is to revamp the existing Electrical and Electronics (E/E) Program into an advanced E/E and Instrumentation Program (INT) that will produce highly qualified technicians able to meet current and future workforce demands while substantially increasing the employability of technical graduates from the college program. The disciplinary focus of the project is Engineering Technology with an emphasis on Electronics Technology. Project partners are members of the college Industry and Business Implementation Team (IBIT) and include government agencies, businesses, and industries such as Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Landrys Corporation, Pyramid Instrumentation, SpawGlass, City Electric, Economic Development Division of County of Galveston, and Galveston Independent School District. These partners typify stakeholders providing almost 3000 new E/E & INT job opportunities within the next few years. The project will broaden opportunities for GC technician students, the majority who are from groups typically underrepresented in STEM technician fields, by supporting the social and financial investment needed to stimulate industry-academic partnerships and develop curriculum based on documented workforce needs. <br/><br/> The project will advance knowledge and understanding within community colleges of technician education by developing a revised Integrated Curriculum Framework for Technician Education (ICF-TE). The ICF-TE, adaptable to other technician education programs, will build industry-academic partnerships that result in increased interactions between students and employers, increased employability, and improvements in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) technician teaching and learning. It will adapt known strategies to support recruitment, retention, and completion of students; and create articulation agreements with area secondary schools. Critical components of the ICF-TE were established in coordination with the IBIT who will continue to assist with implementation and outreach. These critical components of the ICF-TE include: (1) industry recognized stacked certifications, (2) problem-based teaching and learning, (3) advanced technician skills training through progressive (stacked) modules, (4) work ethics curriculum, and (5) practical training with real-world work experiences. IBIT members will interact directly with students by providing opportunities for employment, supervision, mentoring, and instruction. The primary project focus is on the E/E Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree and certificate students and associated faculty and administration. Secondary audiences are future STEM technician students recruited from area high schools and current workers seeking to advance their technician skills. The college will expand successful practices and instructional strategies learned from this project to the other STEM technical programs. An evaluation is designed to determine best practices in technician education to meet workforce needs."

They are providing students with modern biological equipment that will allow them to perform experiments which require gathering, analyzing and graphing of data. The equipment allows the faculty to improve introductory biology courses, resulting in increased understanding of biological principles by all students, plus a greater retention of students in science careers. One component of the new equipment is computers which provide for rapid and accurate data collection and enhanced data analysis. Microcomputers make it possible for student to perform simulation experiments of genetic, ecological, and physiological principles that would otherwise be impossible. The college is contributing an amount equal to the award."

New laboratory instructions are being developed and written to incorporate the microcomputer instrumentation with the current laboratory apparatus. This includes measuring procedures and computer analysis techniques to guide the student to a better understanding of physics principles. The use of a spreadsheet is being emphasized for data analysis in many of the experiments. The spreadsheet serves as a tool for students to select and manipulate collected data, produce graphs and make theoretical comparisons. The computer system expedites data collection, calculations and graphing, providing more time for the student to analyze and comprehend the physics principles involved. The power of the computer system allows for more in-depth analysis and for new types of experiments. Careful consideration is given to the writing of the laboratory instructions so as not to overwhelm the student with the computer operations."

Microcomputer instrumentation measuring techniques will provide for rapid and accurate data collection, enhanced data analysis, and allow for new ways to perform physics experiments. The microcomputer will relieve students from time-consuming calculations and graphing so that more indepth experiments can be performed. Students will use the microcomputer to generate theoretical data and graphs to compare with the experimental results. This process will provide a clear display of the physical principles involved and how they are expressed theoretically. In addition, students exposed to the microcomputer instrumentation will be better prepared to understand the uses of microcomputers in advanced courses, research laboratories, and the work place. The College will match the award with an equal amount."
