A problem being faced by the institution is that academic populations often become compartmentalized and disinterested in other disciplines. The project is developing technology based cross-curriculum lessons in the academic foundation courses by building on experiences in physics and English which introduce students to both technology and other disciplines. The interdisciplinary lessons and activities simultaneously expose the diverse population of students to a technology education and to the connections between disciplines that make for a whole education. Goals are being achieved by establishing a resource and activity center with open access to the latest instructional technology for the faculty and students of Panola College. Faculty are developing curricular materials and revising all classes to include technological applications. The Center allows simultaneous use by structured and unstructured groups involved in varied activities, so students learn different applications. Outcomes include improved faculty cooperation across science and other disciplines, a more computer- and technology-literate student body, a more involved and interrelated curriculum, a more progressive faculty, and a program of workforce training more appropriate for the job markets students will face."

The acquisition of computers and interactive computer equipment also provides much needed exposure to a rapidly changing technological workplace for a very nontraditional student body, especially a large force of older female students. The improvement in equipment is being accompanied by the development of a set of experiments and related activities keyed to the interests of the students and stressing the development of critical reading and thinking skills. Equipment used in the project include MBL interface probes and software, interactive digital video equipment, and additional computer software programs. The curricula targeted for the project include the motion and energy units in the first semester of introductory physics at all levels. Early development versions of experiments in kinematics, dynamics, and mechanics being performed by students who then provide feedback and refinements. Tested and critiqued by the participants, a final set of experiments with assessments ready for use in successive classes is produced. Materials developed can be provided to other introductory physics teachers through professional organizations and publications, along with evaluation information on the impact of the activities on student learning and motivation."
