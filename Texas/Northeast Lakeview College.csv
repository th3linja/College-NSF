The goal is to increase the numbers of Mathematics scholars who enter the workforce or transfer to a university following completion of an associate degree. Project objectives include: (1) recruit, select and award eligible MS 2015 Scholars with scholarships, (2) retain MS 2015 Scholars utilizing enrichment activities including study group sessions, scholars hour, faculty mentoring, academic advising, attendance at conferences, internships, and field trips with university and industry partners, and (3) ensure Scholars enrolled in MS 2015 earn an associate degree and either secure employment with the support of the College career placement services, or pursue a baccalaureate degree with support of the College Transfer Services. Scholars also have the opportunity to gain real life experiences in STEM fields through Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)/Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP), employer job shadowing, and internships. The project targets primarily underrepresented groups. Project results are widely disseminated to share results and emerging innovations."
