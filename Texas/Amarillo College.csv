The objectives of the project are to: 1) develop the mathematics courses, refine the science curriculum, and update the general education curriculum for elementary education; 2) enhance the Amarillo College Teacher Education project through new Introductory Education courses, and by emphasizing hand on, collaborative learning pedagogy and the use of technology in the classroom; 3) develop and implement partnerships and articulation agreements with Texas Universities Schools of Education, beginning with West Texas A&M and Texas Tech Universities; and 4) increase the number of teachers well-prepared to teach the students of the Texas Panhandle at all pre-college levels, K-12. The objectives are being implemented through the newly formed Teacher Education Department in the Division of Sciences and Engineering. New mathematics and science courses incorporate real-world experiences and labs, and the use of technology in teaching and in science. Technology as a teaching tool is taught through the use of technology including Smart classrooms, interactive TV classrooms, computer lab assignments, and Internet ancillaries. Recruitment efforts are designed to attract women, minorities and those who are considering a career change. Industry partners enrich the teacher preparation program by involving scientists and technicians with instructional course development and onsite labs, hosting field trips, and offering internships. Collaborations with school districts provide mentor teachers for preservice students, field observations of K-8 classrooms, and tutoring opportunities. <br/><br/>"

Through strong partnerships with current and potential solar industries and labs in the region, Amarillo College, in conjunction with regional secondary and post-secondary institutions, is taking advantage of its strategic location in the Texas Panhandle. This region is located in both the sun and wind corridors of the nation and enjoys an average of 270 days of sunshine each year (16th in the nation), while being noted as the third windiest area nationally. The Solar Energy Technology program focuses on the development of skills necessary for installation, maintenance, and manufacturing of solar energy technology. Through its efforts, Amarillo College is developing a well-trained alternative-energy workforce for which there is a growing demand both regionally and nationwide, while serving as a model for other two-year colleges poised to help meet the burgeoning workforce needs in the emerging industry of solar energy resources."

This new proposal builds on the solid foundation of the 1994-1997 project in the following ways: it will develop a new biotechnology program; strengthen its articulation agreements with its partner institutions; upgrade its technology resources; and enhance the teacher/faculty development program.    TSA has resulted in a highly successful partnership between Amarillo College (AC), Amarillo Independent School District (AISD), and leading area industries. The activities of the new proposal will elevate TSA to a regional/national model. Dual credit agreements between AC and AISD will be augmented. Articulation agreements will be negotiated among TSA, AC, and regional universities to further a seamless education from the ninth grade through a Baccalaureate degree.    Collaborative faculty development and teacher training efforts, directed toward pre-service and rural in-service teachers, will be implemented. Activities emphasizing technology applications will be available on-site and via ITV. The education/industry partnership procedures now implemented at TSA will be refined into a system and distributed through various means, including consultancies, on-site workshops, and Distance Learning applications.

The laboratory will consist of 20 Hewlett Packard 486 computer work stations networked via Novell software through an existing local file server. Using Visual Basic multimedia software and object oriented programs developed by supervising instructors, a central user interface allows access to, and control of, the various instructional media. Functions and rules, designed to be independent of subject mater, are implemented using a decision table processor. A combination of interactive digitized video and audio is integrated with graphics and text presentations. The students are provided with lecture, drill, problem solving, open ended questions, review, and testing as deemed beneficial or necessary. The computer guides each student through an individualized tutorial session. The route taken by the student is based upon that particular student's activities. Therefore, each student participates in a unique tutorial session geared to his specific requirements and cognitive style. Students who have already utilized two of the currently available MIND mathematics sessions responded positively to correction of their errors in judgment and reasoning. The ability of MIND to provide constructive, instructive feedback creates a mentoring atmosphere dramatically different from other developmental mathematics tutorial softw are."

Amarillo College's Panhandle Pipeline (P2) project supports this initiative by recruiting, retaining, and improving the performance of students obtaining degrees in STEM fields and by promoting transfer of community college students to 4-year universities to complete baccalaureate degrees in STEM. The project provides scholarships to over sixty recent high school graduates and adult returning students who exhibit academic promise in STEM programs and demonstrate financial need. Planned P2 student activities include field research experiences, mentoring, tutoring, academic advising, and career counseling.<br/><br/>The goals of the P2 project include generating evidence of the effectiveness of requiring student participation in structured activities in comparison to allowing students to self-select the structured activities in which to participate. The research team at this Hispanic Serving Institution will implement a longitudinal randomized controlled trial over the five-year project, with students stratified by gender and age (18-22 vs. 23 and over), and randomly assigned within each stratum to either a treatment group requiring participation in a prescribed set of activities, or to a control group, with access to the same activities, but self-directed participation. Analyses will consider student demographic, baseline academic characteristics, and student subgroup (high school dual credit students, returning adult students, and currently enrolled students with undeclared or general studies majors). Results from the project will be disseminated via education journals such as the Community College Journal of Research and Practice and New Directions for Community Colleges and STEM-related conferences such as the American Society of Engineering Education, and the Texas Association of Minority Engineers."

Teaching focus toward this end is moving rather slowly, largely inhibited by obsolete or inadequate equipment. This project is designed to develop the computing hardware/software and curricular revisions necessary to train students in cross-platform hardware and VEDOC environments.
