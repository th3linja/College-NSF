The project at St. Philip's College (SPC), a minority-serving institution designated as both a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) and a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI), seeks to recruit, retain and provide math acceleration for first time in college (FTIC) students. SPC's students face many challenges to post-secondary educational success and unfortunately, only a small percentage of students enroll and succeed in STEM courses. The Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Enrichment by Design (STEMed) project will address the need for low entry students to improve their pathway to a successful STEM education. This project will allow students to move into college-level mathematics courses sooner than usual, therefore graduating earlier. This reduction in obstacles will increase the number of students graduating from SPC, transferring to a 4 year institution and continuing their STEM education, and/or entering the workforce. While SPC improves its developmental math and STEM programs, STEM students from diverse backgrounds will increasingly obtain a quality education. The local community and the nation will benefit from the increase in these future STEM professionals in the workplace.<br/><br/><br/>The overall goal of the STEMed project is to decrease the time FTIC students take to complete their STEM degree and graduate by focusing on recruiting, retaining, and accelerating FTIC STEM students through developmental math. This goal will be accomplished through the following specific objectives: 1) recruit FTIC STEM students from San Antonio Independent School District and SPC's Veteran's Office; 2) implement the Accelerated Math Preparation (AMP) Program to help FTIC STEM students advance into college level math; (3) provide Student Incentive Stipends (SIS) for those in financial need who complete the program; and 4) mentor students until graduation and/or transfer to a four-year institution. The expected outcomes are to decrease degree completion time and increase the number of STEM degree graduates."

Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.<br/><br/>For the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  The CIMA Alliance - a partnership between St. Philip's, San Antonio, Northwest Vista, Palo Alto, and Northeast Lakeview Colleges - is uniquely poised to respond to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce.  That need still exists and is particularly acute in Bexar County (Texas) where minorities traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields comprise much of the region's population.  The CIMA Alliance's goals are to:  1) Increase individual student retention and progression to baccalaureate degrees for URMs; 2) Enable successful transfer of URMs from two-year programs into four-year programs; and 3) Increase access to high-quality undergraduate research experiences.  These goals support the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to ""cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.""  To retain more STEM majors to graduation or transfer, and to provide an intervention that addresses multiple factors that influence Hispanic student success in STEM, the project will encourage students to develop peer and faculty support networks and improve their sense of self-efficacy in STEM through involvement in student-led undergraduate research; peer mentorship; faculty mentorship; tutoring; supplemental instruction, especially in mathematics; and STEM student clubs.  The project supports the goals of the LSAMP program by transforming undergraduate STEM education at all five CIMA Alliance Colleges via 1) relevant curricular and co-curricular educational experiences that are designed to meet the specific needs of underrepresented STEM majors; and 2) professional development in innovative, evidence-based teaching, recruitment, and retention strategies for all STEM faculty and academic advisors. <br/><br/>Dissemination of the evaluation results will provide insight into activities/programs that establish seamless transfer pipelines into four-year institutions, and the extent to which these interventions increase the number of underrepresented community college STEM majors who complete a STEM bachelor's degree within six years."
