The project at Laredo Community College, a two-year institution, seeks to investigate the effectiveness of using a fully-virtual undergraduate research format to enhance quantitative reasoning and literacy while promoting student persistence during a pandemic of COVID-19. Additionally, this project seeks to promote faculty development in guiding undergraduate research at a community college and in an online learning environment.  This work will include collecting and monitoring data on the rate of infection of the COVID-19 in high-poverty rural communities in Laredo thus increasing the diversity of the data available to scientists. The project may shed light on inequities that have occurred as learning has transitioned to fully-virtual formats and may provide targeted strategies for engaging and encouraging groups historically underrepresented in STEM to degree completion. Students and faculty comprise a two-tier model where the former conduct research on COVID-19 in their communities and the latter examine how these students learn in this setting; this structure may serve as a model for other rural community colleges. <br/><br/>By gathering data from the COVID-19 spread in Laredo, this project can be an opportunity to use data to study, to learn, and to prepare for the future, an important component of resiliency. The unique data elements will only exist at this time.  An undergraduate research experience will be designed and implemented around data analysis utilizing existing COVID-19 data resources.  Students will increase their quantitative reasoning knowledge base, skills set, and confidence level by gathering, interpreting, analyzing data, and drawing conclusions based on numerical evidence, and communicating this information to others.  Faculty involved in the project will also gain a quantitative reasoning-focused professional development opportunity. The impact on faculty development for delivering research content material and guiding research virtually as well as students? transitions into four-year institutions and quantitative reasoning ability will be evaluated. The proposal also includes plans for communicating results virtually throughout the college, city, and state, as well as to other HSIs through conferences and professional society meetings.<br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the Hispanic-serving Institutions Program in the Division of Human Resource Development, Directorate of Education and Human Resources. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Laredo Community College (LCC), Texas A & M International University (TAMIU), Texas A & M University-Kingsville (TAMUK), and University of Texas Permian Basin (UTPB) responded to the call by proposing a conference to bring together key stakeholders in undergraduate STEM education at two and four-year public and private Texas HSI colleges and universities in order to inform the design of NSF's Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program. The rationale for the proposed HSI PROMISE: Providing Resources and Opportunities for Minorities in STEM Education conference is based on the great need as well as the great potential to generate new knowledge on effective programs and strategies to recruit, to retain, and to graduate Hispanics in STEM. <br/><br/><br/>The conference will be held in March 2018 in Laredo, Texas, through the Texas Hispanic Serving Institutions Consortium (TxHSIC), an organization which unites such entities.  The conference will convene faculty and administrators from over 83 public and private colleges, universities, community-based organizations and business entities. Media announcements and pre-conference meetings will secure at least 100 attendees from institutions in Texas and at least 100 virtual participants.  Sessions at the HSI PROMISE Conference will primarily focus on undergraduate STEM Education and will provide a networked conduit to provide input to NSF. However, to reap the broader benefit of this effort, students must be empowered to become leaders and partners in STEM innovation. The voices of students currently enrolled in STEM disciplines will be included through focus groups both live and via teleconference with MAES (Latinos in Engineering and Science) LCC and Texas chapters and TAMIU, TAMUK, and UTPB Noyce Scholars. As part of the assessment, the conference will include participation from researchers from the Center for Research and Policy in Education at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSAP). For broader national input and impact the 12 community colleges in the NSF funded, HRD#1450661 KickStarter project with Science Foundation Arizona have been invited to participate via teleconference. A major output of the conference will be a report which will include a list of potential actionable solutions that fall within NSF's mission, policies, and practices and a policy brief through Center for Research and Policy in Education at UTSA. A major outcome will be the continued collaboration of Texas HSIs to secure funding and the optimization of impact from NSF support."

The program will integrate biology, algebra, trigonometry and the physical sciences using problem-posing, discovery learning, river monitoring and exploration, teleconferencing, microcomputers, and a student-led mini-science symposium, as the culminating activity. The immediate beneficiaries of the project are 100 freshmen and sophomores who will take the courses in fulfillment of their associate degree math and science requirements. The courses are designed for pre-service teachers, and science and math majors, as well as for students pursuing other majors and careers.   The major objectives of the project are: 1) Train faculty to design interdisciplinary math/science courses; 2) Design a two-course sequence which will provide the required foundations in four areas of college math and science; 3) Maintain high level of academic achievement for participating students; 4) Increase career knowledge in math, science and math/science education, especially for female and Hispanic students; 5) Expedite institutionalization of the courses; 6) Manage the project effectively. The major contribution which the project will make to the field of math/science education is its focus on a major national resource at risk (the Rio Grande River) as a means of integrating the four disciplines and the emphasis on developing approaches which are effective with students, specifically Hispanic students for whom English is a second language.  This interdisciplinary approach will be particularly valuable as a model for those students who will pursue K-12 science teaching as a career."
