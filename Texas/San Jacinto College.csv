Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.<br/><br/>For the United States to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  The Harris County Community College Alliance (HCCCA), consisting of two public, associate-degree granting, Hispanic Serving two-year institutions (San Jacinto College and Houston Community College), was formed in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce.  That need still exists and is particularly acute in the state of Texas.  HCCCA will build on research-based models which have proven successful in increasing the number of underrepresented community college students who transfer to four-year institutions in a STEM discipline.  This focus supports the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to ""cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.""  In support of the focus, the Alliance will engage students in STEM exposure, first-year peer mentoring, faculty mentoring, competitive summer research and internship opportunities, an annual research symposium, STEM seminar series, and dedicated social media sites to help facilitate the social cohesion critical for community college students to form their academic identify.  In support of the transfer goal, the alliance will use mapping, or guided pathways, with clearly identified educational and career goals, to provide easier transitions to four-year institutions.  In addition, a pipeline will be created that uses alumni LSAMP students already at the transfer institution to help receive the new transfer students and establish a new Community of Scholars at the university.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The National Middle School Aerospace Scholars Program (NaMAS) will increase opportunities for teachers and students in eight states to learn about and experience Information Technology as utilized in the aerospace industry. <br/> <br/>Many students and teachers have limited opportunities to learn about and experience IT.  Two dramatic events of 2004 -- the Mars rover mission and the President's space agenda speech -- captured the imagination of America's youth, making this an ideal time to use space exploration as a hook for technology education.  NaMAS provides a way to leverage this excitement. <br/> <br/>One hundred and fifty teachers will each receive 120 hours of professional development and mentoring in IT concepts, skills, applications and pedagogical strategies, all tied to state/national standards.  More than 18,000 students will be impacted and approximately 1,500 middle grade students will receive additional instruction through a summer robotics experience.   Working in pairs, teachers will participate in four workshops (three at the Johnson Space Center and one online) and facilitate two distance learning events at their schools; they will then integrate their experiences with their classroom instruction.<br/> <br/>This broadly disseminated, extensively evaluated project will increase teacher and student understanding of STEM activities and careers.  The project will also enhance diversity by specifically targeting schools with high numbers of underrepresented students.   The ultimate benefit to society is a more knowledgable and capable workforce that will help ensure a healthy economy and an enhanced quality of life.<br/>"

The project focuses on increasing student engagement and persistence through the development of face-to-face and technology-enhanced learning networks, both within and across campuses. Supporting initiatives include extended orientation programs, peer and faculty mentoring, career-awareness and enhancement activities, and modest financial aid. The intellectual merit of the project lies in the strong partnership between the baccalaureate and associates institutions, well-designed and coherent project elements which build on literature-based best practices and successful pilot studies, clear implementation strategies, well-planned evaluation, and extensive involvement of local STEM industries. Broader impacts include enhanced support at these Hispanic-serving institutions, with additional efforts to reach women, veterans and/or low-income students. Project graduates deepen and diversify the local STEM workforce, and the project provides a useful model for linking associates and baccalaureate institutions, as well as local STEM employers, to support student retention and success."

It builds and expands on current and previous San Jacinto-National Science Foundation projects including a successful CSEMS. Results from this previous grant include 55 successful students known as Scholars, and improved student support systems. Of these 55 recipients 71% are from underrepresented populations. As validated in the previous CSEMS, the project continues to provide academic and mentoring so that a minimum of 70% of scholarship recipients maintain or exceed a 2.5 grade point average, and persist until associate degree attainment or transfer to a 4-year program. Once selected, Scholars are supported by pairing each one with a faculty member, an industry mentor, and an upper class student in the same major. Scholars can take advantage of several other successful projects at this institution; for example, the Partnership for Innovation in Biotechnology and Life Sciences, the Upward Bound Program, The Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program, and the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs. Scholars interested in transferring to a 4-year school are helped with an updated transfer guidebook, and with their applications to the schools. Scholars finishing an associate's degree and who want to find a job, are connected to the Career Planning and Placement Office for help with resumes and also linked with area employers. Features specific to this project, and not part of the original CSEMS, are the student recruitment corps, where students in the program help with recruitment; shared counselors, who act as a link between high school seniors and this project; the expanded cohort approach, where STEP Up Scholars participate in a start of semester orientation that will provide information on the program; and expanded business/industry involvement resulting in more job shadowing and internship opportunities."

The eastern California shear zone and Walker Lane of the western Great Basin form an active belt of structures accommodating about 25% of the relative motion between North America and the Pacific plate. From the Mojave Desert, the displacement is carried north, east of the southern Sierra Nevada, in a narrow zone of deformation bound on the west and east by the Owens Valley and Furnace Creek fault systems. North from the latitude of the central Sierra Nevada, the zone of deformation broadens to include the Walker Lane and central<br/>Nevada seismic belt in the northwestern Great Basin. The Sierra Nevada behaves as a coherent tectonic block with a northwest-directed motion of 10-14 mm/yr and forms the western boundary of the zone of distributed deformation in the Great Basin. A complex pattern of active structures underlies west-central Nevada where displacement is transferred from the eastern California shear zone to the Walker Lane and the central Nevada seismic belt. Integrated geologic, seismological, and GPS geodetic results indicate that the central Walker Lane serves as an displacement transfer system linking stepped northwest-trending transcurrent faults. Within the central Walker Lane displacement partitioning is active and may be accommodated by differential motion of tectonic blocks. A GPS velocity field exhibits a systematic increase in magnitude from east to west across the central Walker Lane and is consistent both with block translation and vertical-axis rotation. Zones of divergent, transcurrent, and convergent motion are observed across suspected block boundaries. The observed velocity field is not easily reconciled with the current understanding of fault displacements and points out the difficulty in comparing geodetic and geologic displacement fields.<br/><br/>The PI's propose an integrated geodetic and geologic investigation of the central Walker Lane to address two questions: (1) Is displacement transfer between transcurrent structures wholly accommodated by kinematically coordinated slip on throughgoing faults, and (2) are the kinematics of active displacement transfer derived from GPS geodesy consistent with the displacement field estimated by earthquake seismology and fault-slip inversion? The central Walker Lane is ideally suited for this study for three reasons: (1) the region is seismically active and well defined earthquake focal mechanisms exist for the displacement transfer fault system, (2) the faults are well exposed and have produced preliminary fault-slip estimates of deformation kinematics, and (3) a complex present-day displacement field with ~10 mm/yr of differential slip is recorded by a GPS geodetic network. These elements will allow characterization of the kinematics of displacement transfer and offer the opportunity to directly compare different means of measuring deformation kinematics. The PI's primary interest is to characterize the kinematics of deformation in the active displacement transfer stepover and to compare the geodetically determined displacement field with that derived from earthquake focal mechanisms and fault-slip inversion. To achieve their research objectives, several aspects of the extensional stepover system exposed in the central Walker Lane must be examined in greater detail. The primary tasks set out in this project are: (1) to establish the spatial distribution of active high-angle faults linking the bounding transcurrent faults, (2) to document the detailed geometry and slip history of fault systems that transfer displacement between transcurrent faults, and (3) to deploy a GPS network with sufficient density to differentiate between continuous versus discontinuous variations in the present-day velocity field.<br/>The PI's will address the tasks listed above with an integrated study utilizing detailed geologic mapping, structural analysis, and GPS geodesy. The investigators (Oldow and Satterfield) each have substantial experience working in the area and by building on previous studies, geological mapping and structural analysis will establish the areal limits of the transtensional fault system, document variable geometric relations between major and secondary fault systems, define the kinematic history of fault motion, and develop first-order estimates of recent slip magnitude by documenting offset landforms. Combined with other ongoing or proposed studies in the central Walker Lane, the results of this research should contribute to an unprecedented view of active transtensional displacement transfer and yield critical insight into the comparison of geologic and geodetic measures of deformation kinematics.<br/>"
