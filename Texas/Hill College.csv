Miller, Clark Beasley, and Marshall Crosby<br/><br/>Tardigrades or water bears are small moss dwelling animals that exhibit<br/>cryptobiosis, the remarkable ability to withstand extreme heat, cold,<br/>pressure and other severe environmental conditions. Generally less than 1 mm<br/>in length, the slow moving tardigrade resembles a cute miniature bear or<br/>caterpillar. They are found on every continent in the moisture trapped by<br/>moss, lichen, soil, or marine sediments. Their cryptobiotic life stage has<br/>been defined as the reversible suspension of metabolism and may last for<br/>decades.  While desiccated in cryptobiosis, tardigrades have been<br/>experimentally subjected to temperatures between -272 C and +150 C, to 6000<br/>atmospheres of pressure, to complete vacuum, to high radiation, to common<br/>gases, and still they returned to an active life stage.  These results<br/>kindle both physiological and evolutionary speculation, including the<br/>possible ability of the animal to be transported through space. Yet, the<br/>ecological requirements and life cycles of tardigrades remain little known.<br/>They are suspected of being carried around the world by the winds, but their<br/>global distributional patterns are very incomplete.  For example, only 47<br/>out of 950+ described species of tardigrades have been reported as occurring<br/>in China. By comparison over 500 species are known to occur upwind in<br/>Europe. Although water bears are often abundant, their contribution to the<br/>life web of the planet is still a mystery. This project will develop<br/>undergraduate research teams at Chestnut Hill College, Philadelphia, PA, and<br/>McMurry University, Abilene, TX.  The teams will conduct a survey of the<br/>tardigrades of China, and over four years, more than 20 student researchers<br/>will collect, identify and publish in the project.  First, the teams will<br/>extract tardigrades from the 10,000 moss samples collected by the Missouri<br/>Botanical Garden in their NSF-funded ""Moss Flora of China"" project.  Second,<br/>the teams will conduct an expedition to China in collaboration with a member<br/>of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and collect 2000 additional samples.<br/>Finally, the teams will work at the Academy of Natural Sciences in<br/>Philadelphia to build and document a voucher collection.<br/><br/>The teams will contribute to the understanding of global diversity by adding<br/>possibly as many as 300 species of tardigrades to our knowledge of the<br/>Chinese fauna.  Our students will probably discover and describe many new<br/>and endemic species.  We will expand the understanding of the ecological<br/>requirements of the animals and test several hypotheses relative to local,<br/>regional, and global distributional and spatial patterns.  The data will be<br/>added to the new Tardigrade Reference Center web site for tardigrade<br/>education and research. The ultimate product will be a data based, digital,<br/>and printable catalogue to the Tardigrades of China, complete with<br/>descriptions, images, identification keys, geo-referencing, and<br/>bibliography.  Such a reference resource will aid taxonomists, ecologists,<br/>biogeographers, teachers, and students all over the world who will be able<br/>to use tardigrades in assessment studies, education, experiments, and<br/>discovery.<br/>"

The instrument requires large sample sizes and inordinate amounts of time for spectra acquisition; it is becoming difficult to furnish with parts and supplies. To modernize the analytical holdings in the department, this project provides a Fourier-transform-infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. Such features as computer control, saving of spectra into memory, spectra subtraction, the availability of spectral library software, and solid-analysis capabilities were not possible with the previous IR, but can be performed with this new instrument. This spectrometer is being used primarily in the organic chemistry laboratory for routine analysis, yet may also find use in inorganic, physical, analytical, and biochemistry. A joint instrumentation course is also being implemented for the departments of chemistry and biology and is introducing the junior and senior science majors to some of the major instrumental methods of both fields. The students served in the sciences would benefit directly by the improved abilities, but also from the new experiments planned, which include the study of various types of polymers, analysis of low-level concentrations in raw materials, and the monitoring of a reaction's progress using FTIR. Ultimately, the desired impact on the students is their improved preparation for entry into the scientific workforce, having had adequate hands-on training using modern instrumental techniques and computers. The time saved on routine operations could be spent exploiting the instrument's numerous capabilities. The lessons learned may be shared with others at local scientific meetings in order to determine the best methods by which to incorporate the machine into the science curriculum."

The results of this research will contribute to an understanding of carbon distribution in crop plants and how it is controlled on a daily as well as a seasonal basis. This can form the basis of practices that increase proportions of photoassimilated carbon sent to harvestable plant parts."

This instrumentation, which includes a FTIR, a vacuum-gas line specially designed for surface chemistry studies and a temperature controller for temperature-dependant studies, provides undergraduate the much needed exposure to some current major direction is chemical research and some hands-on experience in state-of-the-art instrumentation. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds."

Variations in physiological responses to stress during reproductive periods often limit population distributions within species. For instance, lactation, the period during which the dam supports offspring through the production of milk, places particularly high water and energy metabolism requirements on small mammals that have large litters. The ability of the dam to make physiological adjustments to these requirements determines the success or failure in rearing the litter. Ultimately then, the size of the population is partly dependent on the response of the dam to the metabolically demanding period of lactation. The purpose of this project is to study the components of water metabolism during lactation and during non-reproductive periods to determine which and to what extent components are adjusted to the combination of water and lactation stress. The species to be studied are redback voles and white-footed mice. The voles are poorly adapted to dry environments and are often found in desert- like regions. The extent to which these two species adjust components of their water metabolism will thus help elucidate the role of the environment in shaping physiological responses of animals during lactation. Measuring the components of water metabolism represent the first complete quantitative analysis of water metabolism during lactation in a wild species. They are thus critical to eventual understanding of the population dynamics of small mammals."
