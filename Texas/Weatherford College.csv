The project seeks to (1) address the need for greater access and retention of students in the college's technical programs, (2) attract more women into the non-traditional computer science and engineering technology fields, and (3) provide opportunities for a rich pool of academically talented students who lack financial resources to complete their studies on a full-time basis, thereby speeding student progress in completing an associate degree or in transferring to a four-year institution. Priority is given to eligible first-generation and low-income students.<br/><br/>An environment is being created that encourages academic and personal growth for CSEM Scholar. In addition to financial support, the program includes an array of intensive student support and career services, including comprehensive assessment of academic deficiencies; individual and computerized tutoring; study skills and standardized test preparation workshops; academic, personal, and career advising; and faculty, student, and industry mentors. A major component is the active recruitment of high school students enrolled in computer science and engineering related courses in the 42 school districts participating in the Weatherford College Tech Prep Consortium, with a special focus on recruiting female students. The project strengthens the transfer bridge between the college and the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) and increases the incentives for students to pursue higher education through the newly implemented Texas TWO-STEP (Technology Workforce Opportunities through Seamless Transitions and Educational Partnerships) Project. <br/><br/>Over time, the combined efforts of these students provided can make a large impact on communities in high-poverty areas like those in the Weatherford College service area. This program increases the number for women choosing high-demand career fields. As graduates, they are role models to underrepresented students and women as they join national and international firms across the nation."

Today, advanced manufacturing requires workers who can perform complex maintenance and repair procedures on advanced equipment and automation systems. Individuals with the necessary training to perform this work are increasingly scarce.  This project will help to address the need for industrial maintenance automation technicians by developing a curriculum that leads students to an Associates of Applied Science degree and industry-recognized certifications. The project will form new industry partnerships that are anticipated to lead to industry internships for students, professional development for faculty, and equipment procurement for the institution. Partnerships with the Florida Advanced Technological Education Center, local industry employers, secondary faculty, and post-secondary technical educators will inform the project and support the goal of educating highly skilled and certified technicians that meet the workforce needs of the local industry. This project also intends to serve as a catalyst for students to start earning college credit in high school. <br/><br/>Across Texas, the projected increase for skilled industrial automation maintenance technicians is 28.2%;  the projected increase in the North Central Texas region is 35.5%. This high job growth outlook coupled with the limited supply of available education programs is the driving force for this project. Towards that end, the project will expand course offerings and develop a curriculum that leads to an AAS degree with industry-recognized certifications, and prepares students for work by providing industry internships. While pursuing an AAS degree, students will develop hands-on technical skills and earn stackable, nationally recognized certifications. From this base, students can enter the workforce directly or transfer to local universities to earn additional post-secondary degrees in Engineering Technology fields. The project's curriculum with multiple entry and exit points will also open the door to training for incumbent industry technicians who want to upgrade their skills. The project has the potential to produce a model for skilled technical education that can be reproduced across multiple disciplines. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
