More specialists are needed to prevent and investigate threats to the national cyber infrastructure such as theft of data, disabling of networks, and communications disruptions. The project objectives are: to develop a model on ground and online curriculum; to implement a replicable strategy to create awareness of cybersecurity careers among elementary and secondary school teachers, guidance counselors, students, and parents; to shape articulation agreements and other transfer models with universities (especially CAE/IAE institutions); and to create a learning model that helps military veterans earn AAS degrees in DF/IA and advance into technician-level careers and/or further education at universities."

The scholarships are increasing the number of students<br/>graduating with an associate degree in computer science and increasing the number of<br/>students transferring to a four-year college or university in the field of computer science. The academic program is founded on the instructional approach of learning communities and a program design of block scheduling.  This approach provides greater coherence in curriculum, builds a community of active learners and creates diverse, academic peer groups for enriched learning and student development. The integrated educational experience imparts communication skills, critical thinking skills and a developed sense of citizenry to students creating a broader impact to society beyond college environment and a greater benefit to employers. A cohort of twenty students is receiving two-year scholarships during each of the first three years of the project. <br/>"

The fourth year of the project is being used to finish out the last group of students in the program. A unique feature of the project engages students in a learning community that culminates in a service-learning project within a linear algebra class. The scholars are organized into eight to ten member ""pods"" to provide a linkage with the faculty mentors through counsel, friendship, and constructive example. The scholars are being provided with tutoring in the Center of Independent Study and are participating in extracurricular student activities and organizations such as an engineering club. <br/><br/>Faculty members, staff, and administrators working together in groups of about eight people called ""Huey Teams"" are developing and implementing action work plans to improve and focus on retention of the scholars. Underrepresented classes of students are being recruited through an outreach program to area high schools that have high concentrations of Hispanic and African-American students. <br/> <br/><br/><br/>"
