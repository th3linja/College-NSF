Special consideration for scholarships is given to minority and underrepresented students who desire to receive an associate degree and transfer to a baccalaureate program. Students in the program receive individualized support via peer mentoring, academic advising, career exploration and advisement, and tutoring. The scholarships, renewable for three additional semesters after the initial award, provide for the cost of tuition, fees and books for a 12-hour full-time course load. The college has partnered with the Texas A&M University System on an articulation agreement that provides a collaborative support structure to facilitate seamless transition for the student allowing them to complete a four-year degree on the college campus."

Activities include the use of the IR spectrometer to analyze organic compounds prepared by students, the use of the IR to enhance students' understanding of infrared spectroscopy, and the use of the computer to collect, analyze, and store infrared spectra data obtained by the students, as well as information obtained through the use of the gas chromatograph and various chemical experiments. The computer is also used in the classroom for simulations. The project has significantly upgraded the organic chemistry program by introducing routine use of the IR spectrometer and computer. It has allowed students to become better acquainted with the sophistication level of laboratory work and research, and has improved the educational process of the entire chemistry program. The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to the NSF funds."
