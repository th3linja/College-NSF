Marion  Technical College is a two-year college offering 30 technical  degree and certificate programs.  The college has over 1600  students and 100 faculty and staff.    The college needs the Internet connection to be able to access  information resources throughout the state, the nation and the  world.  The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students  of this institution as well as the community in general.  The  award provides partial support of the project for two years."

Such technologies include smart machines, advanced control systems, the industrial internet of things, and cloud services.  This project aims to address the growing gap between the skills employers need in Smart Manufacturing and the skills students develop from traditional technical education programs. By creating new academic pathways, this project plans to increase the number of skilled technicians who can meet the demand from key regional employers. The project will support professional development activities to help college and high school instructors understand new trends in manufacturing. The new curriculum will focus on enabling students to learn the skills needed to be successful in a Smart Manufacturing environment. This project may also provide a model for other colleges that want to implement a Smart Manufacturing technical education program.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to create a manufacturing industry-aligned technician education pathway in Smart Manufacturing, with the goal of increasing the supply of qualified technicians with proficiency in advanced technology applications. A job skills analysis will be performed to identify the set of technical skills that are needed in Smart Manufacturing facilities. Based on the results of the analysis, a curriculum in Smart Manufacturing will be developed to include multiple pathways leading to Associate of Applied Science degrees and certificates. The pathways will also include entry points and fast track options for incumbent workers in manufacturing and information technology fields. A Smart Manufacturing career pathway initiative will be designed to recruit underrepresented students, promote careers in manufacturing to high school students, and establish transfer agreements with four-year programs. The project will also organize an annual Smart Manufacturing Summit to bring together industry practitioners, community college instructors, and high school instructors to promote dissemination of best practices in technical education for Smart Manufacturing. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its purpose is to increase student involvement  in the learning process and to build student excitement through a  multi-dimensional learning lab. It will provide students with  multiple methods of investigation on topics and concepts covered in  class lectures that could not previously be experimented with in a  conventional lab. This will not only improve student understanding,  but will enhance their problem solving skills and promote proper  methods of scientific investigation. The equipment requested  includes six complete 486DX computer systems, each with a lab  interface, physics simulation software and assorted probes; two  printers; and two interactive videodisc systems. This equipment  will bring the latest technology into our labs, giving students the  ability to make investigations and acquire data through both  traditional and innovative techniques.  ***"
