The project is leveraging this partnership to develop and implement the new curriculum.  In particular, Clark State is working with Avetec and other local employers (including QBase, Lexis Nexis, SAIC, Computer Sciences Corporation, Standard Register, Teradata, NCR, and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base) to create high-quality cybersecurity internship opportunities for students.<br/><br/>Expected outcomes of the project include a clearly defined career pathway that can be adopted by other high schools and colleges, significant improvement in student learning in the discipline of cybersecurity, new models for high school and college faculty to work and learn together, new models for work-based learning for students, and integration of high-performance computing and other advanced technologies into the cybersecurity curriculum to meet current and future workforce needs for skilled technicians."

Precision technologies are employed by growers across the U.S. to increase crop yield, reduce production costs and minimize negative impacts to the environment.   Precision technologies are used not only in production agriculture but by a vast number of agricultural and green industries including organic farming, nurseries and sports turf management. With the increasing use of technology, there is a need for more technicians to install, repair and maintain the new technological equipment.  Through the Precision Agriculture Program, Clark State Community College will partner with leaders in the precision agriculture industry and educational institutions to increase the number of students pursuing degrees in precision agriculture and in turn will support the needs of farmers and other green industries utilizing this emerging technology. <br/><br/>Clark State Community College will integrate precision agriculture and the geo-sciences by working with leaders in the precision agriculture industry and other educational institutions to  (1) grow the pipeline of Precision Agriculture students through targeted recruitment; (2) increase retention by expanding career and transfer options for precision agriculture students and (3) address the rapidly changing applications of precision technologies and prepare faculty to respond to ongoing changes in industry needs. The curriculum and knowledge developed through this proposal will be shared with other community colleges and universities through the NSF ATE National GEOTech Center website; through presentations at regional and national conferences; and through in-person faculty exchanges."

A new articulation process between the community college and a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) allows university computer science students to take courses at the community college to gain cybersecurity skills and allows community college students to transfer to complete a bachelor's degree. A partnership with a K-12 school system that has a large minority population allows high school students to enroll in community college courses in cybersecurity. The resulting career pathway engages students from diverse backgrounds to enter employment in the cybersecurity field. The project is also developing a cohort approach to assist post-9/11 veterans and dislocated workers in pursuing rapid credentialing to enter cybersecurity careers.<br/><br/>Although cybersecurity technicians need technical skills, they also need to be able to serve as the human interface between the computing system and its business users, including managers and executives who must implement cybersecurity policies. The project is addressing this need by creating new curricula that give students appropriate business skills. Cybersecurity curricula are also being revised and expanded to incorporate the emerging security needs of both standard PC-based systems and high performance computing (HPC) clusters."

Business, industry, and government need well-prepared technicians who can prevent, detect, and investigate cybersecurity breaches, and the growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have appropriate, specific knowledge and skills. In this project, Clark State Community College will work with high schools to engage students in considering this high-demand career field. In particular, the investigators will lead the development of approximately 30 hands-on cybersecurity laboratory modules that are specifically designed for delivery within a high school classroom environment, with its typical time constraints and limited technical resources. The module development process will consider appropriate content, timing, methods of delivery, and incremental development of knowledge and skills. Project teams consisting of college faculty and students and high school teachers and students will design, develop, and test the modules.<br/><br/>The lab modules will cover entry-level cybersecurity knowledge and skills that map to in-demand industry certifications (specifically, CompTIA Security+ and CISSP), and the modules will also be mapped to the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework. Existing high-quality materials will be adapted when possible, and the investigators will coordinate with others who are currently developing cybersecurity curricula to avoid duplications. An advisory board consisting of college, high school, business, military, and government experts will provide guidance on the topics, content, coverage, and flow of the modules. Each module will consist (typically) of a set of PowerPoint slides, a list of Internet references, a written lab activity, assessment questions, application software, and a mapping to industry certifications and the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework. For each content area, a beginning, intermediate, and advanced cybersecurity lab activity will be developed. The cybersecurity modules will be initially distributed and beta-tested through a hands-on training institute for college and high school educators during the summer."
