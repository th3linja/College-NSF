These technicians ensure the quality and safety of manufactured products in industries such as aerospace, construction, manufacturing, and transportation. Companies typically create their own internal training programs. The technician employees earn certifications that may only be recognized at a specific company or include only a few types of testing methods. A limited number of educational institutions offer courses or programs in NDT technology. To keep up with the increasing workforce demand for NDT technicians, the nation needs more educational programs that provide complete professional preparation. To meet this need, Lorain County Community College will collaborate with two national industry associations and leading employers of technicians to identify the required skills, student learning outcomes, and best practices for NDT programs. The project has the potential to enhance the preparation of future NDT technicians to meet the need in the nation's workforce. <br/><br/>This project main goal is to develop the capacity of community colleges to educate students for jobs in the NDT technician workforce. The project will involve collaboration between Lorain County Community College, the American Society for Nondestructive Testing, the American Welding Society Foundation, and industry partners. It will build upon results from two prior NSF-funded projects at Chattanooga State Community College and Iowa State University that focused in this technology area. Both institutions will also collaborate to accomplish project activities. The collaborators will perform a job task analysis for one technician job level. The results will then be combined with existing job task analyses for the other job levels.  This synthesis aims to create comprehensive competency models for NDT technicians. These competency models will be used to define the desirable student learning outcomes for an associate degree that includes stackable credentials. Educators, along with subject matter experts in industry, will review and validate these learning outcomes. A framework for implementing NDT courses and programs will be developed, documented, and disseminated. The existing professional development program, Weld-Ed Module 7, for high school, community college, and university faculty will also be refined and tested at Lorain County Community College. Approaches to promote awareness of NDT technology and career pathways will be developed and implemented. These strategies will emphasize the inclusion of underrepresented groups and veterans to enhance the diversity of the workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently there is a well-documented shortage of highly skilled welding technicians and this shortage will become more acute in the very near future. The welding/materials joining technician of the 21st century needs to develop sophisticated skills and knowledge to allow him/her to meet the job challenges associated with advanced manufacturing technologies. This project is a collaborative partnership between Lorain County Community College (LCCC) and The Ohio State University (OSU) to jointly design and develop a series curricular models / materials to prepare welding / material joining technicians for manufacturing jobs in the 21 century. One of the main focuses of our project is to advance the technological skills of displaced workers and to increase the exposure of the modern welding field to women, minorities, and the inner-city communities.<br/><br/>Although there are numerous two-year colleges in the US that offer certificate or degree programs in welding technology, these programs tend to be primarily focused on the development of manual skills and low technology arc welding processes. Our project is developing a curriculum model with the potential to be a national template for the training of welding and joining technicians at two-year colleges. Our faculty teams are developing curricular models that can be emulated by secondary schools and other two-year colleges who presently have, or desire to create, programs for the training of welding technicians. Our model provides core competency in the various areas of welding technology - processes, materials, design, and inspection, while allowing flexibility for training students to meet the needs of the local manufacturing community. Following the completion and testing of this model at LCCC and local high schools, a regional center is being established to expand this approach to key two-year colleges and secondary schools in the manufacturing sectors of the Great Lakes Region. These colleges and schools are building upon the model with adaptations as appropriate to meet the needs of their local environment."

The project is building ways to support the needs of a $34.1B industry that reports shortages of competently trained welding technicians. Plans are being developed on how the center can research, prepare, and disseminate all levels of curriculum, provide faculty training to certified levels and standards, and disseminate both curriculum and training from basic through advanced welding applications. <br/><br/>Building upon previous related NSF funded projects, the project is preparing to adopt, adapt, and devise curriculum to meet both the general and highly sophisticated welding needs of the nation's industry. Primarily serving two-year associate degree granting institutions, the project is also developing articulated curriculum for the secondary and postsecondary bachelor degree institutions to provide seamless movement of students from high school to community college to university known as 2+2+2 models. The project plans to disseminate curriculum and provide training support for its use. Planning for the Center and its management structure, curriculum development, training, and dissemination functions includes two and four-year colleges experienced in welding education and the extensive network of education and industrial affiliates of the American Welding Society.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Evolving and improved instructional methodology and technological advances in the field of welding require a focused effort to assure that high impact educational practices are understood and utilized. Combining the knowledge, expertise, and resources of Lorain County Community College, Moraine Valley Community College, The Ohio State University, and the American Welding Society (its network of college affiliates and contacts in industry and government), the partners are well-positioned to conduct the planning, development, and implementation activities. While making available curriculum and faculty training necessary to provide skilled workers, highly trained technicians, and welding engineers for the nation's manufacturers, the planning team is also moving relevant research in workforce needs and advanced technology to the education setting. The partners are positioned to bring their leadership, skills and knowledge to a coordinated effort to address and improve welding education.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The field of welding is evolving as with all other manufacturing technologies and requires the flow of information from education to industry and from industry to education. From basic gas welding to the joining of heat sensitive materials in a clean room, the field is dynamic. The national shortage of welding technicians, and the old image of the field of welding, creates great concern within American industry, causing many to seek workers from outside the country or to move their operations. A great deal can be done to attract new and diverse students with improved curriculum and better-trained faculty. This planning grant focuses on welding education through a coordinated program of educational enhancements, industry leadership and the dissemination of high quality educational materials."

As an ATE Resource Center, Weld-Ed is continuing to support the role and pipeline of welding technicians in industry. Weld-Ed is achieving this goal by: offering a comprehensive welding professional development program for high school teachers, community college and university faculty members, continuing to advance welding technology programs nationally, providing technical assistance consulting to welding programs nationally, and developing a certification program for high school and community college welding technology programs to support improved programs of study with a focus on continuous process improvement. The comprehensive formative and summative evaluation plan includes two project evaluators. Together, they will craft the evaluation design and specifics, develop/adapt the needed instrumentation, and manage data security and analyses. The internal evaluator will be responsible for data collection, analysis, and writing formative evaluation reports. The external evaluator will be responsible for the overall evaluation. The External Evaluator will review data collected, documents and work products, and will use a protocol to interview staff, customers, students, and partners.  The Formative Evaluation will focus on implementation and progress. The implementation evaluation will track whether the project is being conducted as planned. Progress evaluation will determine to what extent the project's goals and objectives are being met. Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected using a mixed-methods approach (Stevens, et. al. 1992) (Frechtling and Sharp 1997). The external evaluator will ensure objectivity and manage the overall summative evaluation. The summative evaluation will address the following questions: 'Was the project successful?' 'Did the project meet the overall goal?' 'What components were most effective?' 'Were the results worth the project's cost?' and 'Is the project replicable and transportable?' The project has four primary objectives.  Objective 1 is to offer a comprehensive welding professional development program for high school teachers, community college and university faculty members. Success will be measured by faculty use of instructional materials and number of individuals participating, and the degree of implementation of curricular improvements on the campuses. Objective 2 is to develop a certification program for high school and community college welding technology programs. Success will be measured by the number of schools participating and the institutionalization of programs. Objective 3 is to advance welding technology programs nationally. Success will be measured by the number of students involved in outreach activities, andthe number of students enrolled in and graduating from welding programs.

However, SENCER ideals have rarely been applied beyond individual courses and have not been attempted on a campus-wide scale or within Early College programs.<br/>This project establishes an academic bridge between high school and college and integrates SENCER civic issues into non-STEM courses.  Three institutions are collaborating to implement SENCER pedagogy and build STEM faculty expertise via a SENCER learning community for first-year non-declared majors while simultaneously embedding the STEM-driven civic issue into multiple disciplines across the university via an innovative educational model, Rethinking STEM.  Additionally, this project introduces SENCERized courses into an Early College high school program.   The thematic course sequence focuses on science inquiry, applied data analysis, service learning, and information literacy within a project-based learning environment. STEM concepts from biology, chemistry, mathematics, public health, and engineering are woven into student writing, speaking, and teamwork assignments.  <br/>The various linked components of the project can be adopted at multiple levels including into a single course, an Early College program, or a campus-wide integration model, depending on institutional resources.  The comprehensive SENCERized model is designed to overcome institutional barriers to STEM reform including disciplinary silos, faculty resistance to novel teaching pedagogies, and constrictions of traditional course scheduling. Through intentional curriculum design, students are better informed, educated, and able to make responsible decisions about pursuing a STEM major."
