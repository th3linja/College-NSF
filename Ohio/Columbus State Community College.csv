To accomplish this goal, the project will complete three specific aims.  First, it will establish an industry-aligned work study model for information technology education.  The program of study will align with flexible industry-recognized apprenticeship approaches and enable students to synergistically learn and earn. The curriculum will be designed to provide foundational science, technology, engineering, and mathematics knowledge, balanced with specific technology competencies.  The second specific aim is to establish a dual credit information technology pathway for high school students, with professional development to enable high school teachers to teach the dual credit courses.  The third specific aim is to publish a technical guide to facilitate replication of the program and pilot the program at Marion Technical College in Ohio. The project has the potential to produce a replicable, flexible work study program designed for the information technology industry that could be implemented nationwide. As a result, it will contribute to building capacity in the nation's cybersecurity workforce.<br/><br/>The project goal is to leverage a collaboratively-developed and industry-led curriculum, leading to the creation, pilot, and scaling of an experiential learning model for students in Information Technology (IT) pathways starting in cybersecurity. An Associate Degree in Cybersecurity will be adapted to incorporate the work study experience. Work study orientation in the first year of the program and work study opportunities in the second year will prepare students to enter the workforce upon graduation. Wrap around services, including a comprehensive orientation and intrusive advising will inform students about the details of the program, and support them as they progress through it. Flexible schedules and learning experiences will facilitate student/employer interactions. With guidance from industry, essential skills and job tasks will be identified and moved earlier in the program of study to better prepare students for their work study experiences. Work study placements will include production-level roles that are re-conceptualized to support student completion of a two-year degree. To support veterans, current military codes and skills will be mapped to the curriculum and the project team will provide training and strategies for supporting military and veteran students in the classroom. Following development of the cybersecurity work study model, the program will be scaled to other IT pathways. The project team will collaborate with regional high schools to engage students in IT dual credit pathways. A Cyber Institute recruiting event will raise awareness of and interest in cybersecurity and IT, as well as recruit students into the program. Project components include conducting work readiness activities and providing competency-based modules to high school teachers to credential them to teach dual credit IT courses. The project will develop products that will be disseminated to other institutions, including a new industry-led replicable work study model in IT pathways, Early IT Pathways Initiative for high school, and a technical guide for replication and piloting at other institutions nationwide. This project is funded by NSF's Advanced Technological Education program, which focuses on the education of technicians for the high-technology fields that drive our nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project has a far-reaching impact on the campus which has extended beyond the Biological and Physical Science Department. As a direct result of the project, two new courses, Environmental Science and Ecology have been added to the curriculum. This enhancement also involves the purchase of two labline environmental chambers, three ecology study chambers, and two plant growth racks, which are all housed in the lab classrooms in Nestor Hall. Upon development of the environmental science course, the Environmental Technology Department made a decision to require it for all of their technical students as a basic related course. All equipment has been integrated into the biology curriculum across the board and is being utilized to its fullest capacity. The videomicroscopy system is being used to teach dissection techniques, to teach microscopy techniques, and to study specific specimens as a group for discussion. Especially significant is the dimension that this equipment adds to the two introductory-level, nonlaboratory courses. Videomicroscopy is such a successful teaching technique that the college has purchased additional systems so that the technique can be made available to any faculty member. The department has recently purchased photoprinters to capture images from the monitors. These images may then be used on quizzes, exams, hand-outs, etc. Interactive computer/video applications are continually being developed using the Media Argus Master Authoring software and hardware purchased. In anatomy, these applications are being used as supplements to lecture material and also, more recently, to provide alternative teaching methods to those students opposed to the dissection of animals. Applications in invertebrate biology are also in use. The results of this project have been disseminated in workshops presented at both the departmental and divisional levels. The authoring software has been widely viewed and interest in developing interactive software applications has grown across campus."
