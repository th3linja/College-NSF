These are necessary to foster a truly meaningful understanding of this rapidly expanding field of science which will have profound implications on all of our lives in the very near future and for many years to come. SSCT students currently have no laboratory experiences related to molecular genetics. Unfortunately, this is a common scenario at many two-year colleges. With $7,114 of NSF-ILI funds, Stark State will develop the project, Incorporation of Basic DNA Laboratory Techniques into Science Courses at the Two-Year College. With the purchase of DNA laboratory equipment, several laboratory experiences will be added to reinforce the lectures of two courses: Principles of Microbiology and Organic & Biological Chemistry. These courses are taken by students in the College's Nursing, Respiratory Therapy Technology and Medical Laboratory Technology programs -- who will be among the next generation of medical technicians in the U.S. The primary objective of the project is to develop a greater understanding of molecular genetics, which will enhance students/graduates' ability to perform technician-level functions in science and health care settings, and participate in the discussion of developing issues related to human genetics. Faculty involved with this project also will share their hands-on expertise with area high school and middle school teachers. by expanding SSCT's capabilities in this area. We will be positioned to share project outcomes with faculty at two-year institutions throughout the country."

The project will address northeastern Ohio's business and industry needs for technical expertise in environmental instrumentation, regulation and compliance areas as well as waste minimization/pollution prevention concepts. This need is critical due to the heavy concentration of manufacturing in the region and the fact that northeastern Ohio is the most polluted quadrant of the state. The College's established ties with business and industry in the region will facilitate the design of a program that will produce uniquely qualified graduates who can help the public and private sectors address growing environmental regulations and concerns. The AAS degree curriculum will be tied into secondary Tech Prep programs in the region and related bachelor's degree programs at Youngstown State University and the University of Findlay. An integral part of the curriculum will be advanced communications technologies which will enable students (high school, two-year college and university) to communicate with each other on collaborative projects. It also will serve as the basis for an Environmental Resource Center (ERC), to be operated by students, which will facilitate and enhance instruction, as well as respond to business/industry and community questions and concerns. A major component of the project will be Summer Institutes and academic year follow-ups for teacher/faculty enhancement in several key areas: pedagogy; technical expertise; and math, science and communications-related instruction."

One consequence of Industry 4.0 is the integration of new technologies into manufacturing processes. Examples of these technologies include the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), autonomous robots, and cyber-physical systems.  Given the rapidly changing tools and processes, manufacturers nationwide often struggle to find technicians with the skills needed in these new work environments. An especially critical need exists for qualified automation/robotics technicians.  This project aims to address this urgent need in advanced manufacturing by educating technicians who have mechanical skills, together with knowledge of and skills in emerging robotic technologies. Working with industry and educational partners, Stark State College plans to improve training of automation and robotics technicians who will meet current and future industry demands. Potential societal benefits of this project include an updated, industry-aligned automation/robotics curriculum; a stackable technician educational pathway with lower time to degree; development of low-cost training units that simulate advanced manufacturing environments; and a professional development model to better prepare instructors to train tomorrow's automation/robotics technicians. <br/><br/>The goals of the project include increasing capacity to effectively train automation/robotics technicians, improving the quality of technician education by better aligning it to workforce needs, and expanding awareness of advanced manufacturing careers among high school students and thus increase participation in automation/robotics programs at both secondary and postsecondary levels. The project aims to achieve these goals by: 1) updating the automation/robotics program curriculum to include training on Industry 4.0 technologies, such as IIoT; 2) creating a new IIoT-focused educational pathway to support student recruitment and retention from high school through associate degree completion; 3) developing low-cost training units to complement the new pathway and curriculum; 4) conducting IIoT boot camps and workshops to engage high school students; and 5) providing professional development to high school and college faculty to grow teaching proficiency and encourage curriculum adoption. Project deliverables and outcomes will be disseminated through regional and national meetings, publications, and webinars or other online mechanisms. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project impacts much of Ohio and provides a model that can be replicated anywhere. A new emerging power technology (EPT) curriculum is developed and is incorporated into College Tech Prep programs at the secondary level and advances to an EPT option that complement engineering technology programs at four community colleges. There is a natural progression to baccalaureate engineering programs at five participating universities, which strengthens their curriculum in fuel cell and other emerging power technologies on their own or through this project and enhances their articulation arrangements with participating two-year colleges. The goal infuses existing programs with content on emerging power technologies, enabling education and businesses to maintain the interdisciplinary nature of fuel cell research and applications. Business involvement with curriculum development and teacher training, and student experiences with fuel cell research labs and emerging power technology companies, and close integration of education programs are cornerstones of the project. Faculty training and ongoing professional development opportunities are an essential project component to ensure the continued delivery of updated content in the classroom."
