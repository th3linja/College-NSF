The project is delivering a pre-engineering experience, advanced math coursework, and project-based instruction.  High school teachers receive technical training to build their STEM teaching competencies. 112 underrepresented students are being recruited from 5 high schools in the Cleveland Metropolitan School District. The project plan includes dual-enrollment, tutoring, mentoring and other support mechanisms. <br/><br/>This proposal builds on the successes of a previous project (ATE-0603427) and addresses the lessons learned from that project. That project successfully stimulated STEM interest in about 200 high school students from Cleveland. It is remarkable that 100% of the students who completed the project graduated from high school and 87% enrolled in higher education, 70% at Cuyahoga CC. However, a follow-up study revealed that only 6 students completed a 2-year degree in a STEM field, because most of the rest were unable to overcome barriers, particularly the remedial mathematics courses.  This proposal addresses the need to better prepare students for college, especially mathematics, and provide better supports while continuing with the activities that were successful at generating student interest in STEM. The project team includes Cuyahoga Community College, Cleveland MSD, and Cleveland State University. <br/><br/>The evaluation will addresses the following goals: 1) Encourage students' readiness for and interest in STEM careers and increase the number of students pursuing technical/engineering degrees; 2) Decrease the need for remedial math coursework in post-secondary education; 3) Equip teachers with the resources to ensure that their students consider and are prepared for the STEM workforce of the future; and 4) Develop a new robotics competition based on the Arduino platform, and measure its efficacy to engage youth."

Yet once students who participate in such programming graduate from high schools and enroll in post-secondary institutions, they often lose interest and drop out due to lack of adequate support. The primary deliverable of this project is a pre-engineering experience, coursework, and project based instruction that includes strong, technical training with additional math preparation, enabling high school students to successfully pursue post-secondary science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) studies as soon as they arrive in college rather than being delayed by remedial coursework. <br/><br/>The project has five goals: (1) provide training for incumbent workers and professional development for teachers who work with students; (2) increase the number of students pursuing technical and engineering degrees upon graduation from high school; (3) reduce the need for remedial math coursework among students matriculating from high school to the college; (4) increase the number of post-secondary students successfully completing technical and engineering degrees or certificates at the college; and (5) develop 2+2+2 articulation agreements with school districts and four-year institutions. <br/><br/>The primary target population consists of at risk and underrepresented Cleveland Metropolitan School District high school students and community college students. The project involves enrollment of Cleveland students in coursework and after school activities that include math, robot programming, work readiness training, and other technical training. These high school and college students are being taught and mentored by high school teachers and industry experts hired as college faculty and mentored and tutored by student mentors from the college. Students also participate in a summer camp developed by the college, Kent State University, and VisualEdge. The project is mapping out a clear pathway for students to follow in pursuing their technical and engineering degrees. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Building on the findings of prior work, this project is improving STEM education for underrepresented students and providing them with a strong support system to ensure their successful completion of post-secondary STEM education and entry into the engineering and engineering technology workforce. The project has the potential to be a student success model for underrepresented youth. <br/> <br/>Broader Impacts: The college has a track record of working with a diverse cross section of society, especially with underrepresented and at risk urban populations. Industry representatives participate in the advisory board that helps develop curriculum for training students in the transferable work skills required in technical jobs. Project results and findings are being shared with colleagues at regional and national conferences and on the project web site."

In this laboratory-based project, students are able to measure process variables, study characteristics of the instruments and processes, learn computerized data acquisition and use the data to control the processes. Using the software-based control system, students are also able to create virtual instrumentation and study its behavior before implementation of actual process. Further, more complex processes may be created by combining individual processes and used to train industrial personnel in modern instrumentation and process control technology. Development of the laboratory using LabVolt process stations, National Instrument data acquisition hardware, and an IBM PC platform with a LabView system is a cost-effective way to deliver control experiences to students."
