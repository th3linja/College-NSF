Success in math courses is a barrier for students pursuing degrees in engineering technology and environmental technology programs at Zane State College.  Thus, improving success in math gateway courses is essential to support student degree completion and employment in well-paid technician jobs that are in-demand in this region of Appalachian Ohio.  This project will research, design, and pilot best practices in math education, evaluate the results, and customize and cement successes into the foundation of gateway math courses.  Through continual assessment of progress, it will strive to implement a continuous improvement model.  The project team will share information about the structure and outcomes of the modified mathematics courses with high schools, colleges, and universities.  <br/><br/>The project will begin with an in-depth analysis of institutional success data and a literature review of best practices in math education.  This information will then be used to develop: (1) mathematics skills workshops for students held in term intercessions to prepare for the upcoming semester math course; (2) supplemental mathematics instruction including just-in-time co-requisite models designed with input from industry and business, as well as an embedded professional tutor in math courses; (3) professional development about active and contextualized learning for faculty teaching math courses or teaching math within technical courses; and (4) a math department assessment and review plan to help ensure future student success by building on the data collected and materials/curriculum designed during the project. In the curricular design process, the College will consider the needs of industry (through the technology program Advisory Committees), students (through the validated Math Belonging survey, satisfaction surveys, interviews, and course success data), and faculty (through professional development activities and feedback). It is anticipated that these math course improvements will improve student success in math gateway courses and result in an increase in completion rates of students in STEM technology programs. This project is funded by the NSF Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This four-partner  project is an expansion of a pilot project begun two years  ago in one of the district's middle schools.    Project objectives include (1) expanding the numbers and  grade levels of students involved from seventh and eight  grade participants in one middle school to sixth through  twelfth grade participants district-wide, (2) strengthening  the curriculum and expanding the project calendar, and (3)  developing a strong web of support for young women with an  interest in science, engineering, and mathematics.  Activities will encompass the school year and extend into  separate, intensive summer camp sessions for each grade  level.  Key offerings of the project are monthly seminars  and informal  discussions with women in SEM-related  professions, field trips involving hands-on learning  activities, academic instruction in a variety of scientific  disciplines, and a mentorship program with females in SEM-  related professions.    The project will serve approximately 280 female students  annually.  Each grade level component will be progressively  more personalized.  Because few of the district's students  have had any exposure to college, every field activity will  be tied to a college visit.  Student participants will  represent a diverse range of academic ability and economic,  ethnic, and racial backgrounds.    Summer components will focus on environmental science  activities which will involve biology, chemistry, physics,  geology, and math.  Science, math, and computer laboratories  at both colleges, regional field sites, and the diverse  habitats found at the Wilds will provide exceptional  sc ientific exploration opportunities.  Female undergraduate  science majors at both college will serve as laboratory  assistants and mentors to middle school and high school  participants.  A graduate course will be presented annually  to district teachers and administrative personnel to educate  them about gender equity issues concerning women and girls  in science.    At a recognition ceremony each spring and at the end of each  of the summer sessions, student participants will report on  program activities, introduce video clips of field  experience and seminars, and present individual and group  projects.  Expected project outcomes include removing  artificial barriers that affect females entering SEM field,  increasing the number of  females continuing science  education, and building a solid and sound program which can  be replicated in other school districts."
