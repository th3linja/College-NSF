As evidenced by articles and letters of concern in HVAC and building trade periodicals, building mechanical system owners, designers, installers, and occupant representatives need a commonly understood, scientific means of field testing HVAC system control performance which can more readily determine compliance with desired and specified operation. <br/><br/> A previous NSF grant to the Sinclair Community College (DUE 9544183) sponsored a symposium attended by national representatives of colleges and universities, HVAC industry professionals, and HVAC equipment manufacturers. At the symposium it was demonstrated that control systems performance could be analyzed through hard copy recordings of controller responses. This textbook-described method of analysis was in lieu of the non-scientific practice of visual monitoring, or vague ""self tuning"" programs used for observing and correcting controller behavior.<br/><br/>As the result of a request at the symposium, Sinclair faculty is developing a curriculum module to teach the utilization of a hand-held graphing calculator to be substituted for the fragile, expensive, sophisticated laboratory test equipment that was used at the symposium to demonstrate the method of controller behavior analysis based on textbook control theory.<br/><br/> The curriculum module is used in existing HVAC control courses at Sinclair Community College and is available to other Associate and Bachelor degree programs in mechanical engineering technology. All materials and technology developed are disseminated through engineering education professional associations. The final report serves as the basis of technical papers presented to general meetings of such professional societies as ASHRAE, IEEE, ASEE, and ISA.<br/><br/>Development of curriculum is accomplished in cooperation with faculty from the University of Dayton, a professional advisory panel, and curriculum developers at the National Center of Excellence for Advanced Manufacturing Education. The Sinclair faculty researchers administering this development project have years of experience in designing and installing major commercial HVAC control systems. In addition, such material can find ready use nationally in continuing-education courses offered by two-year colleges to employees of local industry. With the articulation agreements and working arrangements that Sinclair has with such four-year colleges as the University of Dayton, Miami University of Middletown, University of Cincinnati College of Applied Science, University of Toledo, and Ferris State University, the developed material is being used in many engineering and technical programs."

Today's leading-edge, semi-autonomous connected vehicles utilize technology that includes radars, cameras, lidar, multi-domain controllers, wireless vehicle-to-vehicle communications, and software applications, to name a few. The proposed postsecondary faculty professional development project, focused on automated and connected vehicle technology, will serve the NSF's mission of promoting the progress of science by creating industry-supported workshops and college-level educational resources to academically strengthen postsecondary automotive technician degree programs. Project activities such as summer institutes and professional development webinars for faculty will be designed to advance the field of vehicle technology education across the country by informing the educators of future technicians about the new generation of vehicles that are radically changing the automotive and transportation industries. In addition to professional development, the autonomous vehicles and other materials purchased through the grant will also be used to provide outreach activities in secondary schools, including creating a toolkit comprised of interactive demonstrations designed to orient secondary school students, teachers, and counselors to automotive technician educational pathways and careers. <br/><br/>Auto technician education must keep pace with the complexity of vehicles that incorporate aspects of robotics, machine learning, computer vision, and mechanical engineering. The goal of the proposed project is to increase the autonomous vehicle technology experience and knowledge of automotive technology educators throughout the nation and address the growing need for qualified, knowledgeable technicians with capacity to maintain and repair autonomous vehicles. The project will provide a week-long professional development session, webinars, and other learning events for 40 community college faculty annually. The project will also conduct outreach activities in secondary schools to impart information about the high wage, high-tech nature of the work of automotive technicians, important since many secondary school students skilled in science, math, and technology are not choosing automotive technician careers due in part to their misconceptions about what the work entails. The project will also monitor and document the skills and knowledge needed by the future automotive technician who will repair and maintain vehicles using a new set of skills not taught today. The project outcomes will be useful to other institutions with automotive technician education programs that need to update their curriculum to meet the changing needs in the industry or are struggling to diversify their student population interested in automotive technology careers."
