Business, industry, and government need well-prepared technicians who can detect, investigate, and prevent cybersecurity breaches. The growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have specific knowledge and skills to meet these workforce demands. The Ohio Cyber Range is a cloud-based, web-accessible environment where cybersecurity students, faculty, and incumbent workers can access educational materials and conduct lab exercises. It provides a virtual setting that simulates the information technology (IT) infrastructure found in a business workplace. Using this virtual cybersecurity training ground, students and faculty can explore real-world scenarios involving networks that would be expensive or impractical to set up in physical lab environments. This project will develop eight to ten cybersecurity training scenarios that focus on specific cybersecurity situations within advanced manufacturing.  These scenarios will be deployed on the Ohio Cyber Range, along with associated guides, to facilitate wide usage.  The scenarios will also be incorporated into IT courses at Northwest State Community College. The scenarios, the learning objectives, and the related materials will be developed with the advice of engineers and IT professionals from local manufacturing companies. Students and incumbent workers who use the scenarios around the state will be better prepared to meet the cybersecurity needs of Ohio employers.<br/><br/>The project will develop training scenarios focusing on topics ranging from basic (e.g., basic networking, subnetting, and enumerating a network) to advanced (e.g., attacking/defending Human Machine Interface [HMI] passwords, attacking/defending Programmable Logic Controller [PLC] register values). Each scenario will have a detailed document that describes the background, instructions, tasks, goals, and learning objectives for the learning exercise associated with the scenario. An independent subject matter expert will review each scenario to ensure that it meets the stated learning objectives and is aligned with national and industry standards. Faculty at Northwest State Community College will incorporate scenarios into several courses, including Networking Fundamentals, Security Auditing, and Programmable Logic Controllers. The project team will offer workshops to faculty from colleges in Ohio and surrounding states to help them effectively add the scenarios to their own courses.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, which focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For many years Northwest State Community College supported programs on separate skilled trades based on industry practice related to their separate job classifications. A recent trend has been the combining of these separate skilled trades into a multi-craft maintenance position. This project  will convert a traditional automation maintenance technology program to a competency-based, hybrid instructional model with flexible laboratory scheduling options. The Hands On Maintenance Education for Technicians (HOME4TECHS) project will support professional development for faculty on competency-based education, and the development and deployment of modular online courses. This project will advance the knowledge and understanding of competencies required by manufacturing companies for students entering the automation maintenance field. The project will also advance the knowledge and understanding of the steps a college needs to take in order to convert a traditional college curriculum and delivery system, to an employer-driven, competency-based curriculum, delivered through hybrid learning.<br/><br/>The goals of the project are to: re-structure 3 courses in the automation maintenance curriculum to a competency-based curriculum, so that they will be aligned with the needs of the local industry. This will involve moving the lecture portion of the courses to a modular online format, and developing an open lab delivery model for the hands-on portion of the 3 courses. Restructuring the delivery system will make the courses more accessible to students and incumbent workers. The project will engage college faculty and manufacturing employers in a collaborative effort to develop a competency-based, hybrid learning model that can be widely disseminated and scaled to promote applied learning in the technical workforce. Project outcomes will be disseminated through a meeting of the Northwest Ohio College Presidents. Research data on the effectiveness of moving from the traditional learning model to the hybrid learning model will be made broadly available."

To fill the need for qualified manufacturing technicians, Northwest State Community College (NSCC) will work with industries to improve a competency-based advanced manufacturing program and promote its broader adoption. NSCC plans wide-spread implementation of its instructional model through a Networked Improvement Community (NIC) of partner colleges and their local industries across four states: Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, and North Carolina. Through mentorship, professional development, and focused cooperation, this project will improve the effectiveness of advanced manufacturing courses, increase access to technical education programs, and prepare technicians with the skillsets that employers require. On a broad scale, this project will promote diversity by increasing opportunities for underserved populations to pursue high-demand, family-sustaining occupations in the technical workforce.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to: provide a more accessible method of instruction, remove barriers for existing and potential college students, align students' skills attainment with workplace demands, and increase the knowledge of implementing a competency-based hybrid instructional model for advanced manufacturing courses. NSCC will demonstrate the process of converting two traditional courses to the new model, and partner colleges in the NIC will determine which elements of the model are best suited to adapt within their programs. NSCC will then work with the partners to incorporate the model into specific courses. In addition, NSCC will administer nine, two-day professional development workshops for technical faculty from additional colleges in the state-wide networks of the NIC partners, with the potential to impact ninety colleges. NSCC will continue to mentor faculty on scaling elements of the model into programs at their institutions and will provide assistance with implementation efforts.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
