In 1994 we purchased microscale laboratory equipment and added CSL to the curriculum. The next phase introduces Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), the requested equipment. FTIR expands our courses qualitatively and quantitatively, supporting the small sample sizes obtained with microscale techniques and instrumentation based quantitative analysis. It allows kinetics studies, provides high throughput for large classes, and more effectively interests our students in science and in teaching science, exposing them to current research and analysis methods used in the workplace. Use of modern instrumentation to develop and enforce concepts and theories integrates lecture and laboratory components and adds discovery based instruction. The spectral analysis software to be installed at both schools supports undergraduate research projects and joint discovery projects/tutoring and mentioning projects with FHS. The student synthetic project using FTIR, is added in organic courses. Non science students in chemistry and environmental science courses learn the role of instrumentation in the process of scientific discovery. A Criminalistics course will be added to support FVCC's Criminal Justice program and local law enforcement officers, utilizing FTIR to analyze drugs paint chips and explosives. Project results will be disseminated to college and high school chemistry and CSL educators locally and nationally via publications, presentations, and electronic delivery The project will be evaluated by student reflection, academic s uccess, and enrollments."

The model centers around the creation of a veteran engineer's Learning Community and establishing active learning pedagogies for students who are veterans. The project seeks to understand how each of these interventions impacts learning outcomes, retention, and transition of veterans from two year college to other programs or careers. The model proposed may be widely transferable to other schools who also seek to target veterans.<br/><br/>The broader significance and importance of this project are to inform other colleges about effective interventions for veterans. The proposed program seeks to create balanced, long-term, incremental improvements. The program specifically targets outreach efforts towards low income, first generation students, Native Americans, rural veterans."

Specific strategies are professional development workshops for high school teachers and hands-on biotechnology lab experiences for high school students, both done in collaboration with the PIs and FVCC students. Many of the high schools in the FVCC service area are rural and this project will contribute to educating the workforce in rural, northwestern Montana.<br/><br/>TeaM SCoRE Biotechnology will increase the awareness and the size of FVCC's biotechnology program by reaching out to high school students and teachers in rural northwestern Montana. It will also leverage the prior ATE at FVCC, ""Strengthening Continuity of Rural Education in Biotechnology"" (Award #1104075), and the work of the Community College Undergraduate Research Initiative (CCURI, Award #1524353 and #1118679). TeaM SCoRE will provide professional development workshops for high school teachers along with equipment and materials needed to implement biotechnology laboratory exercises, with the goal of preparing high school students for the FVCC biotechnology program. There is the potential to learn about effective practices in community college and high school collaborations, how those collaborations support student transitions and persistence in higher education, and what practices are most effective in engaging students in a rural environment. Project evaluation will focus on identifying the activities that best engage high school teachers, and how these projects improve the knowledge and skills of high school students. The dissemination plan will have a local focus, by working with local and regional media, and will take advantage of the regional and national ATE networks."

The primary goals of this project are to: <br/>     1. Develop a biotechnology transfer program that incorporates biotechnology cross-disciplinary laboratory exercises in cell and molecular biology and microbiology courses, and develop a new course entitled Introduction to Biotechnology. The new biotechnology course introduces students to fundamental biotechnology principles and methods, using inquiry-based, interdisciplinary laboratory instruction. <br/>     2. Serve as a pipeline linking the biotechnology curriculum between rural high schools, the community college, and four-year universities. <br/>     3. Target recruitment of underserved rural science students for biotechnology careers. <br/>     4. Establish ties to biotechnology industry in Montana by developing partnerships and business connections between industry and education. <br/><br/>Intellectual merit: The program is integrating laboratory methods in cellular, molecular, and biotechnology within an established biology and chemistry curriculum. In addition to emphasizing cross-disciplinary laboratory experiences, the new laboratory exercises utilize well-characterized proteins and their genes to introduce students to the basic concepts of biotechnology, while allowing them to develop fundamental laboratory skills. Basic laboratory procedures, such as spectroscopy, isolation of macromolecules, recombinant DNA techniques, immunochemistry, and mammalian and microbial cell culture are being introduced in inquiry-based laboratory exercises. Students are experiencing the excitement of scientific discovery while simultaneously learning the essential tools of biotechnology in a collaborative learning environment.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: This project primarily impacts students living in a rural community experiencing continued economic downturn and job losses. The students served by this institution include many first-generation college students. The curriculum provides a path to careers in biotechnology, an industry that is expected to grow in Montana and other northwestern states. Further, the program provides a model for promoting biotechnology education and establishing ties to industry in a rural environment."
