The ""2017 Stone Child College Targeted STEM Infusion Project"" directly addresses these goals through the development of an instructional model that incorporates new ethnobotany curriculum materials and research experiences across the STEM disciplines at Stone Child College (SCC). This work will expand STEM offerings, improve the academic environment for Native students, and encourage them to pursue challenging and rewarding STEM degrees and careers, thus leading to a more diverse national workforce and strengthening our country's prosperity and security. The lessons learned about the efficacy of the project in supporting Native students' STEM outcomes will contribute to our understanding of best practices for attracting and preparing underrepresented students in STEM as the next generation of STEM professionals.<br/><br/>The ""2017 Stone Child College Targeted STEM Infusion Project"" at Stone Child College will develop an ethnobotany course and student research experiences that address core botany concepts and traditional plant knowledge of the Chippewa-Cree as a means to engage Native students in STEM studies. The project will update and enhance a forty-year-old book on Chippewa-Cree ethnobotany and develop a video to complement the book for use in the course, which will be offered across the STEM disciplinary degrees at SCC. The project will also develop and test a student cohort model that employs near-peer mentoring of high school students by college undergraduates as they complete the course and engage in culturally relevant ethnobotany research. Cultural experts from the tribal community will collaborate with college STEM faculty members in the design and delivery of the course and research experiences. The project's evaluation will collect evidence of the efficacy of the project in supporting improved STEM outcomes for Native students. Knowledge generated will be disseminated in publications and presentations and will contribute to the knowledge base on means for increasing the representation of Native people in STEM degrees and careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Targeted STEM Infusion Projects (TSIPs) are offered as a TCUP strand for meritorious projects that focus on smaller scale transformative efforts. The Stone Child College (SCC) TSIP is designed to directly benefit students' academic performance in STEM, foster greater mathematics preparation for future students who enroll at this or another institution of higher education, and broadly impact the community served by the college with increased mathematics literacy and performance.  It will also increase the diversity of the STEM workforce by increasing the mathematics success of American Indians seeking to enter STEM studies and fields.<br/><br/>The project will improve students' mathematics competency, reducing their need for and time spent in remedial coursework, and enhancing the college's mathematics courses by:  (a) providing local high school seniors the opportunity for an early assessment exam; (b) conducting specialized intensive sessions, some targeting college freshmen and some provided for any student who wishes to increase his or her math competency; and (c) reassessing and updating the mathematics curriculum to ensure it aligns with the standards of four-year institutions, to increase students' successful transfer to baccalaureate programs.  <br/><br/>The main goal of the Stone Child College TSIP is to effect long-range improvement in STEM education and to increase the flow of Native American students into scientific technological careers. This will be accomplished through two primary objectives. The first objective is to operate a Targeted STEM Infusion Project with 12 students per cycle. There will be three cycles per year, and each cycle will last eight weeks. The first two cycles in a year will focus on college freshmen and sophomore students who are in need of assistance to raise achievement levels so they can remain on track for a timely college completion. The third cycle will be open to any students at any level who will benefit from supplemental instruction in STEM fields. The second objective of the Stone Child College TSIP is to reassess and update the mathematics curriculum at Stone Child College.<br/><br/>In 2011, 36.5% of the students entering SCC were required to take remedial math courses. As a result of this placement, students have to attend SCC for a minimum of two extra semesters. The Stone Child College TSIP is going to create three math learning courses each year. The objective of the three courses is to enhance the learning of the students and to help them complete the SCC math requirements in a timely manner. As a result of the enhanced knowledge through the project, more students will be placed in STEM occupations."

The educational purposes involve the development of new networking and user service training programs for both video and data networks, improvement of the teaching of SMET subjects in K-12 and postsecondary institutions that are controlled by Indians, and the improvement of education for American Indians in the health fields. The general concept of this application is to maximize the impact that already existing SMET coursework and programs have. This will be done by distributing the responsibility for offering programs throughout the AlHEC's video and data networks. Because the 29 institutions that compose the American Indian Higher Education Consortium are widespread, generally small, and chronically underfunded, there has always been an emphasis on sharing resources. There is wide variance among the institutions with regard to levels of SMET curriculum and the level of networking currently available. This interest in sharing through networking led to the formation of the AIHEC telecommunication project five years ago, in order to make use of technology to make limited resources go further. Since that time, there has also been a good deal of interest in the establishment of computer interconnectivity. Approximately 1/2 of the colleges have such connectivity. This project calls for funding for one year for developing programs that provide both short-term training in such things as using the Internet, using Interactive video, and technical support for networks. In the technology area, it also calls for the development of Associate's degrees in areas that provide user support. A second area of development in this first year is the Health Services area. AIHEC will identify areas of greatest need with the Indian Health Service and develop distributed programs in these areas. The colleges need certain things to make these operations possible. First, it needs faculty with u pgraded academic preparation in SMET areas and it needs students who are better prepared. Thus, there is a component that provides for distributed graduate education for both college and K-12 teachers. On the other side of infrastructure, many colleges do not have connectivity yet. For this reason, all the Tribal Colleges in Montana will be linked with a system that they have designed to provide maximum capability for uperading. Finally, the AIHEC Telecommunications Network will be utilized by providing uplinks to satellites at three sites, one each in Minnesota, Montana, and North Dakota. These uplinks will be capable of feeding instruction to all 29 colleges; 7 colleges will be able to originate programming."
