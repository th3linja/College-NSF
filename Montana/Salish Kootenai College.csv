Professional<br/>development for teachers, adoption of effective assessment strategies, and promotion of <br/>community involvement in the educational process will enhance the quality and quantity of the<br/>learning experience for students in science, mathematics, and technology within and beyond the<br/>school walls.  The classroom teacher is the key to the effectiveness of the delivery of curricular<br/>changes to the individual student. In the SKC RSI project, the primary goal is to have every<br/>teacher achieve the status of ""master teacher"" and to have every student achieve the status <br/>of ""master learner.""  It is important to understand that the journey of the educational experience <br/>Is a balanced effort between teachers and students.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this proposal is to implement a comprehensive, sustainable, adaptable<br/>system-wide reform of science, mathematics and technology instruction and learning on the<br/>Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana. This will lead to increased achievement for all students<br/>and specifically emphasizes greater achievements for two groups of under-served populations in<br/>this rural setting: Native American students and girls.  <br/><br/>SKC is the resource identifier for science, mathematics, and technology areas and has<br/>already developed coursework in biology, chemistry, physics, and earth sciences. SKC will, in<br/>effect, become a ""mini clearinghouse"" for science, mathematics, and technology (SMT) areas<br/>using American Indian-specific teaching and learning materials in professional development<br/>in SMT areas for teachers and students. SKC is currently preparing assessment strategies<br/>and activities that will be shared with other TCRSI projects.<br/><br/>Other major goals are the improvement of science, mathematics, and technology education<br/>on the Flathead Indian Reservation including access to high quality, standards-based <br/>instruction for all students, innovative use of educational technologies for interactive delivery<br/>and the training of the teaching workforce to meet the demands of a new instructional<br/>paradigm. Rigorous, standards-based instruction for all students will be implemented on the<br/>Flathead Indian Reservation and the curriculum, professional development, and assessment<br/>systems to support that instruction. The development of the policy changes and resource<br/>allocations to support these efforts are the long-term goal of the SKC RSI Program.<br/><br/><br/>"

Once the language of tens of thousands, it is now spoken by less than 60. Of that total only 30 are considered fluent speakers. As with many indigenous people, time, history, encroachment and cultural pressures have devastated the Salish language. With support from the National Science Foundation, Joshua Brown of the Salish Kootenai College, together with three linguists, the Salish-Pend d'Oreille Culture Committee, the Tribal People's Center, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribal Preservation Office and fluent speakers from the community, will preserve and expand on an extensive collection of recordings. Currently, the Salish-Pend d'Oreille Culture Committee has an archive of magnetic cassette tapes with over 1000 hours of Salish conversations recorded primarily between the early 1970's and early 1980's. They also have a video archive of over 200 tapes from this same time period. Most of the individuals included on the recordings are now dead. These recordings are one of the only links to those who were raised with the language from birth. <br/><br/>The first focus will be on archival transfers and preservation. These archival materials will be rounded out with recordings from the remaining fluent speakers. This community driven project is one that is urgently needed. Within these archives lay keys to syntax, grammar, diction, dialect, cultural norms, history and the full power of the Salish language. Preservation of the language must also include the use of tools and resources that are accurate, accessible and up-to-date. These resources will then be available to teachers, school administrators, tribal members, scholars and the entire Reservation community.     <br/>"

The first option is an Associate of Science in Mathematical Sciences (ASMS) and the second option is a Bachelors of Science in Secondary Education-Mathematics(BoSSEM). The program will be a collaborative effort between the SKC Education Department, SKC's STEM Division,<br/>and the Indigenous Math and Science Institute primarily, with valuable input from tribal elders, education professionals, and other tribal community partners.  The overall goal of the SKC-MS program is to improve the achievement and representation of American Indian people in math and math education.  This goal will be realized through specific objectives and activities designed to facilitate an effective and efficient transition of qualified students through each program. This proposal is driven by the urgent need for mathematicians and mathematics teachers, especially American Indian teachers for reservation schools. <br/><br/>The SKC-MS Program will follow the developments within the K-16 mathematics education initiative, which is to be jointly administered by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Education.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The SKC-MS Program will use innovative and transformational strategies in implementing the new culturally competent Mathematical Science and Secondary Education in Mathematics programs.  Likewise, the project's evaluation focus will ensure the programs are on track and lead to successful outcomes. The program stakeholders will work closely with the evaluation team to gather and analyze data from the program.  Program outcomes will be used to generate a new conceptual framework for supporting the growth of American Indian mathematicians and secondary math teachers. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The SKC-MS Program will have broader impacts as evidenced by an increase in the numbers of American Indian math teachers who can support American Indian middle and high school students effectively. In addition, the SKC-MS Program will make a significant impact within the mathematical sciences discipline through cultural integration. SKC faculty will gain added skills in and understanding of culturally competent teaching and will generate new culturally competent courses through interactions with tribal elders and educators. The addition of higher level mathematics will enhance other STEM programs at SKC, improving SKC's ability to support student achievement in all academic areas of the college, possibly leading to additional STEM BS programs. The results and outcomes from the SKC-MS Program will be disseminated in professional publications and conferences that will add to the knowledge base surrounding mathematics and mathematics education. SKC will be the first tribal college to offer a Secondary Mathematics Education degree program. The SKC education department can build upon the success of both the Secondary Science and Secondary Mathematics programs and potentially expand into other STEM education disciplines. The program results will be disseminated widely for use by teacher preparation programs at other tribal colleges and universities."

This approach has the potential to improve learning by inviting the experiences and perspectives of under-served learners into mathematics and science classrooms.<br/><br/>This project will partner with the Salish and Kootenai Tribes and Elders, Flathead Reservation School Districts, and educators in informal educational settings. This partnership will provide support for undergraduate pre-service teachers as they develop culturally congruent instructional practices.  The project will also support Noyce recipients through induction as new teachers. This support will include classroom visits by project staff, professional development, professional learning community meetings, online discussions, and administrative support.  The project can contribute new knowledge about the ways teachers are prepared to meet the needs of underserved students.  It also aims to contribute to higher science achievement for all students, as project graduates model the application STEM-focused equity and access pedagogy with colleagues in the professional learning communities to which they belong.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This alliance was created in response to the Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program solicitation (NSF 16-552).  The AGEP program seeks to advance knowledge about models to improve pathways to the professoriate and success of historically underrepresented minority (URM) graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty in specific STEM disciplines and/or STEM education research fields.  AGEP Transformation Alliances develop, replicate or reproduce; implement and study, via integrated educational and social science research, models to transform the dissertator phase of doctoral education, postdoctoral training and/or faculty advancement, and the transitions within and across the pathway levels, of URMs in STEM and/or STEM education research careers.<br/><br/>Recent reports indicate that only 700 Native American science and engineering doctoral degree holders are employed full time in our nation's universities and colleges.  Universities and colleges are endeavoring to recruit, retain, and promote Native American STEM faculty who serve as role models and academic leaders for Native American students to learn from, to work with, and to emulate in order to address the STEM achievement gap between native and non-native undergraduate and graduate students in our nation.  The Willow AGEP Alliance has the potential to advance a model to improve the success and retention of Native Americans in instructional STEM faculty positions, contributing to native STEM role models for native STEM undergraduate and graduate students at postsecondary academic institutions.<br/><br/>The Willow AGEP Alliance plans to develop, implement, and study a model for the professional success of Native American STEM faculty.  Participants include Native American STEM faculty working at one of the three partnering colleges. The project includes three intervention components in the model: a mentoring program; grant preparation and management training activities; and an institutional support program, which focuses on retention efforts.  The integrated qualitative research will examine the personal, relational, and collective experiences of the native STEM instructional faculty and staff that enhance or inhibit professional development and career advancement; examine the underlying institutional issues affecting promotion and advancement; examine the approaches the faculty and staff use to increase promotion and advancement; examine the how different types of universities and colleges (tribal vs. non-tribal) support Native American STEM instructional faculty and staff; and examine the climate of STEM departments to compare how non-native STEM instructional faculty and staff and native STEM instructional faculty and staff experience professional development, promotion and advancement.  The formative and summative evaluation plan follows an indigenous evaluation framework.  There is an advisory board for feedback to the team, and a dissemination plan to include sharing with other tribal colleges and non-tribal universities in Montana, North Dakota, Idaho and Washington."

The overall goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive interactive  All-Nations Alliance and network to increase substantially the quality and quantity of American  Indians receiving baccalaureate degrees and graduate degrees in SEM.  The foundation of this  alliance is 24 participating tribal colleges located in the following nine (9) states: MT, WA, ND,  SD, NE, MN, MI, WI, KS.  The tribal colleges are the functional units of the alliance  developing and implementing project activities, recruiting and selecting students, tracking  students, maintaining a comprehensive telecommunications network, establishing retention  programs, and providing student support services.  The alliance will develop and implement  innovative programs with input from both the Indian community and the SEM community to  enhance matriculation of American Indian students at the following three critical transition  points:  (1) high school to college (tribal/community/four-year); (2) two-year college  (tribal/community) to four-year SEM degree-granting institutions; and (3) four-year institutions  to doctoral degree-granting programs in SEM fields.  Tribal colleges will develop a pipeline  network by establishing linkages with local middle/high schools and four-year SEM degree-  granting institutions.  Through this unique longitudinal pipeline networking program, the All-  Nations Alliance proposes to increase the numbers of American Indians receiving baccalaureate  and doctoral degrees in science and engineering by six to ten-fold by the year 2000.  One of the  objectives of this proposal is to reduce by a least one half the dropout/stopout rate for American  Indians in the education pipeline with effective retention programs.  The All-Nations Alliance  will be supervised by a Governing Board and administered by two institutions: Salish Kootenai  College (SKC), a tribal college, and M ontana State University (MSU), a SEM degree-granting  institution.  Initially, SKC, working closely with 23 tribal colleges, will be responsible for  programmatic activities and MSU will be responsible for fiscal management.  By Years 4 and  5 of the five year program, both programmatic and fiscal management will be transferred to  SKC and the participating tribal colleges.  The All-Nations Alliance will establish a collaborative  network of research scientists at universities and research laboratories to serve as mentors for  American Indian students.  In addition, the alliance will establish productive linkages and  partnerships with other SEM-based programs, businesses, industry, organizations, state/federal  agencies and foundations.  The two lead institutions, SKC and MSU, offer a comprehensive  array of in-kind contributions to the project.  Additional sources of support for this project in  cost sharing/matching have been identified by the tribal colleges through other grants and  foundations.

Additional core partner institutions of higher education (IHE) are Montana State University, in Bozeman, and the University of Montana, in Missoula.  Core partners from the K-12 community include the schools of the Flathead Reservation, located in western Montana, and the schools of the Crow and Northern Cheyenne Reservations, located in southeastern Montana, as well as Missoula area public school districts. Specific districts include Missoula County Public Schools, Lolo School District #7, School District #30 Lake County, Polson Schools District #23, Dixon Public Schools District No. 9 Sanders County, Joint School District #8, Superior School District, and Lone Rock Elementary District #13.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the Big Sky Science Partnership (BSSP) is to increase science achievement of American Indian students in grades 3-8 of partner schools.  A cross-disciplinary team of the partner IHEs' Geoscience, Physics, Astronomy and Education faculty, along with professional developers from the SKC Indigenous Math and Science Institute, and the Center for Learning and Teaching in the West, K-8 teachers, and administrators will collaboratively design and facilitate year-round project activities. A total of ninety grade 3-8 inservice teachers will become Teacher Leaders in the BSSP, through two cohorts of 45 teachers each.  Up to twenty preservice teacher candidates will also have the opportunity to participate in the summer institute and other selected academic year activities. Participants will be involved in two-week summer institutes during which IHE science and education partners will facilitate challenging integrated science content and pedagogy courses.  Each of the three summers will focus on a different content area, astronomy, geoscience, and physics, respectively, but concepts that permeate these different disciplines will be highlighted.  Importantly, cultural competency strategies will be woven throughout the courses.  There will also be distinctive and multi-day workshops on cultural competency delivered by tribal consultants and scientists, in addition to other leadership development activities. School year professional learning community activities will engage partners in online science content courses, online discussion forums, eight days of on site workshops, and job embedded coaching to further develop teachers' professional and leadership skills and knowledge.<br/><br/>A responsive project evaluation design will be employed to assess impacts on teachers' content knowledge, instructional practices and attitudes, and students' achievement and attitudes using a mixed-methods, quasi experimental design. Impacts on higher education faculty's instructional practice and attitudes will also be assessed. The BSSP has objectives at both the K-8 and IHE level, to: 1) improve science instruction by deepening K-8 inservice and preservice educators' understanding of science content and pedagogy; 2) generate school based K-8 science Teacher Leaders; 3) develop cultural competency in science instruction in K-20 instructors; 4) improve IHEs science faculty members' understanding of K-8 school culture and issues in precollege science education; 5) improve IHEs science faculty member's effectiveness in working with precollege teachers; 6) develop a sustainable professional learning community made up of the BSSP partners; 7) generate a set of rigorous graduate level science courses designed for K-8 teachers, and 8) develop a viable model of science teacher preparation that will produce K-8 teachers well prepared to teach science to diverse students.  In addition, the BSSP has identified three research questions associated with barriers to using effective classroom practices, fostering leadership and professional learning communities for building content knowledge and pedagogical skills in support of at-risk students, and the efficacy of online learning environments in diverse cultures."

Nevertheless, studies of Sulfolobus proteins and Sulfolobus virus proteins are still in their infancy and little is known about protein function and the evolutionary mechanisms underlying extremophile diversity. The goal of this project is to investigate the structure and function of Sulfolobus proteins and Sulfolobus Spindle Virus (SSV) proteins as well as to identify potential protein-protein interactions in this host-virus system. Proteins of particular interest include the Sulfolobus Heat-Shock Proteins (HSPs) and their complexes, which are classified as group II chaperonins. HSP complexes, such as the double-ring nanomeric rosettasome are composed of combinations of 60kDa alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. Also, of interest are the SSV structural proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3, which are three of only four proteins that have been assigned a function in the viral life cycle. Two specific aims of this project are to: (1) characterize Sulfolobus growth and fusellovirus production in wild-type and HSP-knockouts as a function of different environmental conditions; (2) construct clones, express, and purify viral proteins to test potential HSP-VP interactions in vitro and identify potential in vivo host protein-viral protein interactions. In addition to these specific aims, techniques in electron microscopy will be employed to elucidate irregularities in viral structure under experimental conditions and x-ray crystallography will be employed to further explore protein structure. Environmental samples will also be taken from geothermal regions that have yet to be screened for Sulfolobus in an effort to either identify novel Sulfolobales and SSVs or to verify the presence of characterized species from previously understudied habitats.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Science faculty at Salish Kootenai College (Pablo, MT), The University of Montana (Missoula, MT), Montana State University (Bozeman, MT), and Portland State University (PSU) have developed significant teaching and research collaborations over the past three years with the goal of increasing the number of Native American students pursuing advanced degrees in the sciences. This project will serve to enhance these collaborations by providing a research program on a topic of common interest. Native American undergraduate students from the PI's laboratory will engage in both on-campus and off-campus research activities related to this project. Specifically, up to two undergraduates per year will be supported by undergraduate assistantships and will freely move between the laboratories of the PI and of his collaborators to learn techniques and use instrumentation that is specifically available at particular institutions. In addition, this project aims to support one graduate student from a university partner who will participate in a summer internship at the tribal college as part of a near-peer mentoring and student exchange program. The goal is to increase accessibility of high-end instrumentation to Native students while encouraging cross-cultural exchange between smaller minority-serving institutions and larger university partners so that transitioning from undergraduate science degree programs to research-based graduate science degree programs is a pleasant experience for participating Native students. The PI currently offers summer experiences for high school students and undergraduate students from the Flathead Indian Reservation community and other tribal communities across the Nations; this project will complement ongoing activities by providing continual support for exceptional students emerging from these outreach and educational programs."

The main objective of the workshops is to explore new teaching methodologies in areas such as math-science integration, inquiry-based learning, practical/experiential learning, integration of research and coursework, and incorporation of new technologies. The TIR will provide additional opportunities for professional development. During a TIR, individual TC faculty members may take courses that will enable them to expand and enrich course offerings or lead to an advanced degree, conduct research with university colleagues, co-teach courses with university colleagues, and participate in educational reform efforts. An important additional benefit to the TIR is that tribal college faculty, through collaborations with university faculty, will provide leadership in developing strategies that are more conducive to the education of Native Americans in the university system. Participation in the workshops will be open to 20 TC math-science faculty as well as four university faculty per year. Workshops will take place during the summers of 1998 and 1999. Participation in the terms-in-residence program will be selective and based on the quality of sub-proposals submitted to the steering committee. The development and reinforcement of collaboration between TC and university faculty will be of long-term benefit to higher education across Montana. In particular, tribal college faculty will enrich their knowledge while simultaneously enriching the university system with methods that have proven to be successful in the education of Native Americans in science and math."

American Indians as a group are currently underachieving on nearly every metric of science achievement, from standardized tests, to high school and college graduation rates, to entry into science related professions. A small but growing number of studies is providing preliminary evidence of the efficacy of CCI in improving Indigenous students' achievement in math and science, but additional and rigorously designed empirical studies like RAISE are necessary in order to further elucidate the nature of the relationship between CCI and student outcomes.<br/>A recent product stemming from research in CCI is the Culturally Congruent Instruction Survey (CCIS). Designed and validated by tribal elders, teachers, and faculty working with pre college students from three American Indian reservations in Montana, the survey operationalizes the nature of CCI for five Montana tribal cultures by outlining the specifics of CCI in three main categories - science content, pedagogy and instructional environment. The study described here tests the efficacy of CCI by systematically infusing specific elements of CCI, as found on the CCIS, into select college science courses, and investigating their effects on student outcomes. The study employs a mixed methods quasi experimental design, comparing pre and post treatment data such as course completion rates, course grades, quality of student work samples, student attitude surveys and focus group responses, graduation rates and entry into science professions. Course content, instruction and environment are thoroughly documented through classroom instruction observations, course syllabi and outlines, and interviews with course instructors. Multiple regression analyses are used to identify correlations between specific CCI course elements and student outcomes data, with additional analyses conducted to further characterize these relationships, such as interactions between variables.<br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The RAISE project, by providing evidence of the nature of CCI and its efficacy for improving American Indian students' achievement in college science, holds potential for broad impacts. Application of the findings from the study to transform the SKC science curriculum and instruction will translate into higher levels of science achievement and greater numbers of students pursuing science related professions. The active engagement of SKC science faculty in the study will improve their understanding of education research and of effective science instruction, thus contributing to their professional development both as science educators and researchers. The dissemination of the study?s findings through publications and presentations to a broad audience of STEM faculty and education researchers expands its potential nationally and globally for improving college STEM instruction and student achievement. The increased number of STEM graduates will help ameliorate the shortage of STEM professionals in the United States."

In order to<br/>achieve this goal, the ANLSAMP partner institutions have designed program components that will increase<br/>the number of American Indians who will graduate with A.A. and B.S. degrees in these fields. ANLSAMP<br/>is uniquely situated in that it works with most of the nations tribal colleges as well as a number of majority<br/>colleges/universities. We have assembled these particular groups for two reasons. First, a greater number<br/>of American Indians are pursuing higher education at tribal colleges. The participation of this group of<br/>course, insures that NSF funding will impact the greatest number of Native American students. Second,<br/>since many tribal colleges do not have STEM bachelors degree programs, it is important to have majority<br/>institutions within our network to bridge our students from the associate degree level to the bachelor degree<br/>and beyond.<br/>ANLSAMP has developed the following list of five-year objectives to accomplish the goal presented<br/>above:<br/>Increase by 100%, the enrollment of American Indian students in STEM disciplines at<br/>Associate degree-granting institutions.<br/>To increase by 100%, the enrollment of American Indian students in STEM disciplines at<br/>Bachelors of Science degree granting institutions.<br/>To increase by 100%, the number of American Indians who received Bachelors degrees in<br/>STEM disciplines.<br/>To double the number of Bachelors Degree programs in STEM at tribal colleges, from 3 to 6.<br/>To enroll 15% of the STEM bachelor degree recipients in graduate degree programs.<br/>Thirty-six institutions of higher education have come together to form an Alliance with the<br/>specific intent of influencing American Indian students as well as other under-represented minority students<br/>to pursue and attain associate and bachelor degrees in one of the science, technology engineering and<br/>mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The under-representation of American Indians in the STEM professions<br/>has been highlighted and targeted as an action item at the national level over several decades. However,<br/>the participation of American Indians in STEM careers has shown only marginal improvements over the<br/>years, such that their current representation amount to less than 0.5% of the STEM workforce. This low<br/>representation has the potential of failing to tap into the unique capabilities and talents of American<br/>Indians.<br/>ANLSAMP has carefully considered its project development in order to meet the intellectual merit<br/>required of an LSAMP project. As a consequence of an evaluation of the levels of commitments and needs<br/>and of the availability of resources, ANLSAMP has re-organized its partner institution into three tiers. This<br/>tier structure will build capacity and facilitate the participation of all STEM faculty and students at partner<br/>institutions while, at the same time, ensuring that program objectives are accomplished. The ANLSAMP<br/>partner institutions will utilize a 4-R model to address the four most important areas for our students and<br/>our program. They are: 1) Recruitment, 2) Retention, 3) Research and, 4) Reporting. Within each R, our<br/>focus is that of continually providing opportunities to substantially increase the number of Native American<br/>STEM students who enroll in and graduate from partner institutions.<br/>Upon the successful implementation of program activities, the Alliance leadership expects to<br/>observe a significant and sustained increase in STEM student enrollment at the partner institutions. The<br/>increase in enrollment will accrue from the success of the recruitment initiatives within the high school and<br/>two-year colleges. The enhancement of the academic activities for student participants, the culmination of<br/>tutoring, mentoring and field and internship experiences are expected to stimulate and sustain students<br/>interests with a concomitant increase in student retention rates. The activities presented in this proposal are<br/>expected to generate an increase in the rate of student persistence and progression in pursuit of these<br/>accomplishments.<br/>The broader impact for this program reaches beyond American Indians in higher education. The<br/>Alliance leadership expects that the support from the NSF, the non-federally funded internships and<br/>scholarships along with in-kind contributions from the partner institutions will ultimately pay significant<br/>dividends to the States in which partner institutions are located, to the nation and in particular, to American<br/>Indian Communities."

The United States continues to fall short in graduating enough STEM professionals to meet this nation's growing demand, especially NA and other under-represented minorities (URM). To help address this continuing national crisis, the ANLSAMP will continue to improve and grow the pipeline for NA and other URM STEM students through its established network of collaborating partner institutions.<br/>Thirty-eight institutions of higher learning have again come together to continue the effort toward broadening the participation of NA and URM in STEM at the baccalaureate level. The increase in the number of STEM bachelor's degree programs at tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) is a key indicator that the NA community has a wholehearted interest in strengthening the knowledge base in STEM. The number of BS STEM degree programs at partner TCUs has increased from three to eight during the period 2005 - 2010.<br/>The goal of the ANLSAMP program is again to double the number of Native Americans and other under-represented minorities enrolled in STEM disciplines at partner institutions and assist them in completing a STEM BS degree. In order to achieve this goal and related supporting objectives, the ANLSAMP program has built activities through lessons learned and constructive input from it's established cohort of partner institutions. Part of what makes the ANLSAMP program unique is that over the years most the TCUs have been involved in the Alliance at some point. TCUs are spread out over a fourteen states, primarily in the upper Midwest. TCUs are targeted because more NA students are pursuing their higher education at TCUs (IPEDS, 2010). Because many TCUs lack a variety of STEM degrees, especially STEM BS programs, it is still important to have mainstream colleges and institutions within the network to transition students from the associate level to the bachelor level and beyond.<br/>The objectives of ANLSAMP are as follows:<br/>1. Increase by 100%, the enrollment of Native American students in STEM disciplines at Bachelors of Science degree-granting institutions.<br/>2. Increase by 100%, the number of Native American students who receive a BS in STEM.<br/>3. Increase by 100%, the number of ANLSAMP Scholars that transition from a two-year STEM program into a four-year STEM program.<br/>4. Increase by 20%, the retention of Native American students in STEM disciplines at BS degree-granting institutions.<br/>5. To enroll 15% of the ANLSAMP Scholar recipients in STEM graduate programs.<br/>The broader impact of this program reaches beyond expanding the opportunities for NA and other URM in STEM, ANLSAMP will continue to break down barriers and expand horizons for the target population of mostly rural and economically challenged NA students.<br/>The intellectual merit of the ANLSAMP program, through the refinement and process of continual improvement within state activities, is expected to have a transformative effect on how to incorporate proven best practices into STEM research and education."
