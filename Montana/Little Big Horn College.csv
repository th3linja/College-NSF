Greater infusion of technology throughout the STEM curriculum will be a major tool for accomplishing our goals.  To improve retention, our STEM Student Advisor will support and advise STEM students in navigating LBHC; supervise them in jobs as peer tutors and community workers; lead ""Bridge"" visits to transfer campuses, coordinate the Honors Academy and, overall, will be committed to their success.   <br/>We believe that solid academic preparation, informed by good advising, is also critical to our STEM students' <br/>success.  We will have an active program of course and curriculum revision, based on current research in Native American education, which gives priority to revising bottleneck courses, and develops our new forestry curriculum as well as courses which ""round out"" our current STEM degree programs.  We will invest in the professional development of STEM faculty, both in discipline and in pedagogy.  With the Center for Learning and Teaching in the West (CLTW), will host an annual STEM education research conference, emphasizing Indian education, for our STEM faculty and area teachers to learn and to share ideas and materials.  To promote high student engagement in science courses, we will increase field and lab activities, and add residential field camps for incoming freshmen and for sophomores.  Peer tutoring will support students in improving their academic performance. <br/>Financial incentives help retain students; STEM majors will have competitive opportunities to tutor or perform community service work; and will be assisted in identifying and applying for external scholarships, summer internships, research opportunities, and relevant summer jobs.  These training opportunities will be another avenue for active learning, and will help students develop valuable job skills and/or an appreciation for research. <br/>How can the infusion of technology help our students to succeed?  We.ll use technology to improve <br/>communication, e.g., by adding course information to the LBHC website, along with a database of scholarship and internship opportunities.  Students will be given the option of computer assisted instruction for their lower level math courses.  STEM students will have every opportunity to develop the technical skills they will need: in addition to the required I.S. course (3 cr.), we will develop 1-2 cr. courses in GPS, scientific presentations, graphing calculators and information literacy.  A variety of upper level courses will have assignments that will require students to use their technology skills.  We will also use CD-ROMs and Smartboards to enhance instruction.  In order to accomplish these technology infusion objectives, we will upgrade and expand our technology infrastructure, and provide training and technical support to our faculty in the use of educational technology.   <br/>Finally, we will ensure the effectiveness of this TCUP endeavor through excellent project management, <br/>including collaborative planning, effective evaluation, broad dissemination of results and attention to long term sustainability, and with the guidance of an external Advisory Committee. <br/>Broader Impacts:   LBHC serves a 98% Native American student body.  Since we expanded our I.T. curricula <br/>and added natural resource and environmental science (NR/ES) degree programs in 1996, our alumni have gone on to double the number of Crow Tribal professionals in NR/ES and IT fields.  They are beginning to expand the sense of what is possible for students who are coming up behind them; we are seeing and feeling a significant ground swell of interest in these career fields, as well as the first small cohort of math/engineering majors.  The broader impact of this project will be to support, sustain and expand this movement towards careers in STEM fields among our Crow and other Native American students.  Our alumni are starting to bring their skills back to our community, working for the Tribe and LBHC, and are also changing the region, e.g., by diversifying the professional staffs of BLM and BOR.  In addition, we are building relationships between LBHC, our area teachers, and CLTW.  With CLTW.s assistance we plan to offer area teachers the option of taking our STEM short courses for graduate credit, and will open our annual STEM educational research conference to them as well as to our STEM majors and pre-service teachers.  We are working to create a future in which our Crow children are learning from Crow STEM teachers, and have Crow role models in STEM professions.  Although each Tribe is unique, what we learn here will likely be useful to other Tribal Colleges, and perhaps also to other colleges and universities with significant Native <br/>American enrollment.  These audiences will be the focus of our dissemination efforts.. <br/>Intellectual Merit:  This project addresses a significant nation wide shortage of Native American STEM <br/>professionals, and takes an innovative, integrated approach towards increasing the numbers and improving the preparation of TC STEM graduates. The piloting of computer assisted instruction (CAI) in TC math courses, the integration of traditional ecological knowledge into TC science courses, collaboration with our regional CLTW, and the use of DACUMs for TC curriculum development are all innovative project components - which will advance our knowledge and understanding of effectively educating TC STEM majors.   The Project leadership & STEM faculty bring many years of TC teaching and program administration experience to this project, including managing earlier LBHC grants for STEM curriculum development, faculty development, undergraduate research & scholarships."

A total of 30 students over a five-year period will participate in the project beginning Summer 2009. Students from the three schools will engage in 2-year cohorts where they will they will do research in ecology, environmental science and microbiology projects relevant to their lives and career goals. The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the Missouri and Yellowstone River systems, numerous mountain ranges and the Northern Great Plains will provide diverse ecosystems and opportunities for research. The collaborative network will enhance student opportunities on all three campuses and will also support graduates of LBHC and BCC as they transition to MSU for their bachelor?s degrees. The student participants will be mentored by science faculty and by Native American professional biologists in developing academic and research skills to prepare them to complete baccalaureate degrees and continue on in graduate school. The overall goal of the project is to increase the number of Native Americans completing bachelor?s degrees and entering graduate programs in ecology, in environmental science and in biological fields.

Prototypes of course materials are being developed to achieve integration between TEK and the science of ecology. Such materials will be a valuable resource to educators at tribal colleges and at mainstream universities as we endeavor to support the development of increasing numbers of Native Americans in science disciplines. Education of mainstream scientists in the approaches of TEK increases cross-cultural competence, reduces barriers to participation by Native Americans, and enriches the perspectives available for environmental problem solving. Prototypes are being developed collaboratively between two institutions and two PIs with shared goals, but different audiences: a tribal college, Little Big Horn College (LBHC), and a mainstream university, SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF). At LBHC the prototype is intended as a culturally responsive, place-based ecology course, which will integrate the science of ecology with TEK, primarily from Crow culture. At SUNY ESF, the prototype will be concept-based and span a wide diversity of cultures and ecosystems. The materials we develop will be incorporated into a course presently taught at both institutions, General Ecology. The scope of traditional knowledge has many parallels with the content of a typical ecology course, making it an excellent forum for introducing TEK. An Ecology course is also a nearly universal part of college biology curricula, and it thus provides an appropriate venue for wider dissemination of the materials developed."

LBHC will utilize the lessons learned from Phase I activites and continue to promote the NSF drivers while implementing strategies to assist in their effort to provide a program that will catapult the schools serving their students to meet the National standards.  Special emphasis will be placed on a holistic approach to community reform using RSI activities to promote a comprehensive approach for systemic reform.<br/><br/>First, it is recognized that the vision held by stakeholders must be changed to accomplish systemic reform.  Through the stages of implementation, the various groups must be increased to shape the purpose and goals of the new system.  LBHC will invite all stakeholders to participate in this process.   As the vision develops and is translated into practice, the support of the public and of the political leadership at all levels of the system must expand.<br/><br/>Several isssues will be addressed during Phase II to ensure that the stakeholders are in careful collaboration.   The following will guide this effort:<br/><br/>A common language and purpose will be develop and will resonate for the RSI to all stakeholders.  Training and orientation will help all sites to envision the total picture and each will be better positioned to take action and support the reform effort.<br/>A strategy will be implemented to move reform forward with a clear plan and related objectives.<br/>An evaluation process will be implemented to measure the progress and guide the project.<br/><br/>For systemic change to occur,  key participants will be included in all activities throughout the reform process.  The proposed systemic reform effort will impact the required fundamental, comprehensive and coordinated changes for MST systemic change.  The changes will reflect policy, financing, governance, management, content and conduct.  All essential features of the school systems and LBHC will be engaged and operating as a seamless entity in promoting a comprehensive, standards-based curriculum and instructional materials for all students.  Special emphasis will be placed on assessment of effort and on assessment practices.  Activities will be aligned with the NSF drivers.<br/>"
