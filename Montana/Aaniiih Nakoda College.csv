The TCU Enterprise Advancement Centers (TEA Centers) strand allows TCUP institutions to capitalize on their investments in STEM instructional and research capacity.  The Aaniiih Nakoda Nic'-Mni' (Water) Center (""the Center""), housed at Aaniiih Nakoda College (ANC), aligns with this TCUP goal in its research, education, and outreach work focusing on water quality and management issues relevant to the Fort Belknap Indian Community (FBIC). The Center builds on and expands a partnership between the college and the FBIC that has been focused on water quality monitoring and management for many years. The Center's research and outreach activities build the scientific knowledge base, increase public literacy, and inform the tribe's water management decisions.<br/><br/>The Aaniiih Nakoda Nic'-Mni' (Water) Center will conduct and integrate findings from four related water research studies on issues of critical concern to the FBIC; offer training and education programs that will provide community members with the knowledge, skills, experiences and credentials needed to address local water issues effectively; and gather and share information that can be used by the community to make informed decisions regarding the proper care and use of the reservation's water resources.  The research will include comparative bioassessments of surface water flowing onto the Fort Belknap reservation, principally through standardized biomonitoring methods that include protocols for benthic macroinvertebrates and periphyton; studies of local impacts on groundwater resources; and potential benefits of subsurface irrigation systems.  Training and education programs will target ANC students and FBIC employees, as well as other local stakeholders. ANC students will have opportunities for internships through the Center, and other individuals will have opportunities to participate in workshops and short courses.  The Center will also serve as a local clearinghouse for the community on water resource information.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover may prove to be a model for similar engagement at other small community colleges.<br/><br/>The project creates intensive research-based training courses in the life sciences for students and faculty, using zebrafish as a versatile model organism for classroom experiments. In Aim 1, a series of courses will be created, in partnership between faculty at tribal colleges (A'aniiih Nakoda College, Chief Dull Knife College, Little Big Horn College, and Fort Peck Community College) and research faculty at Montana State University-Bozeman (MSU). Each set of course curricula will reflect issues relevant to the specific faculty, students, and community. Aim 2, through week-long intensive courses, lays the foundation for tribal college faculty to develop or enhance their research mindset and skills to mentor undergraduate research endeavors at their respective colleges. Collaboration between tribal college faculty and the MSU scientists will continue to support tribal college faculty as they develop new, or enhance existing research projects and research-based courses. Aim 3 proposes that students will attend courses and then participate as student TAs for deeper engagement with the research mindset. Offering these courses at the tribal colleges allows students to attend the courses within their communities and permits these courses to act as stepping stones for future endeavors, including research programs at their tribal colleges and programs at 4-year universities like MSU."

The overall goal of the project is to increase<br/>student participation and success in FBC.s STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) degree<br/>programs.  To accomplish this goal the project will provide STEM students with an integrated continuum of learning opportunities in mathematics, science and technology, while, at the same time, strengthening the institution.s STEM programs through curriculum reform, faculty development, and infrastructure enhancement.  Student-centered activities include an active outreach and recruiting program, pre-college summer sessions, expanded tutoring and in-class assistance in STEM course offerings, research and internship opportunities, and a bridge program with Montana State University-Northern.  At the same time, STEM faculty and staff will participate in a series of activities designed to improve the quality of STEM instruction, increase faculty knowledge in both teaching methods and course content, and enhance institutional resources needed to effectively deliver STEM classroom, laboratory<br/>and field-based instruction.  Through the implementation of this comprehensive strategy, the project will achieve five student-centered performance objectives and build the college.s capacity to offer high quality STEM courses and degree programs.  Evaluation activities will provide project personnel with the information needed to effectively monitor the project.s progress, improve its ongoing effectiveness, assess its success in achieving project goals and objectives, and communicate its outcomes to a variety of stakeholders.  Ms. Mary John Taylor, dean of academic affairs at FBC, will serve as principal investigator for the project. <br/><br/>INTELLECTUAL MERIT<br/>The project addresses NSF's review criteria of intellectual merit in several ways.  Students at FBC will<br/>advance their knowledge and understanding in STEM disciplines through participation in pre-college summer<br/>enrichment sessions, reformed STEM course offerings, research and/or internship opportunities, and bridge program activities.  Faculty will increase their understanding of effective pedagogy and content knowledge through professional development opportunities and faculty-student research projects.  Data gathered through evaluation activities will expand the body of knowledge concerning the effectiveness of project strategies among American Indian students.<br/>While the effectiveness of many of the learning/teaching strategies and activities employed in this project<br/>have been documented in the research-based literature, their modification for use in the unique context of Fort Belknap College is both creative and original.  Recruitment and outreach efforts targeting non-traditional students, innovative pre-college STEM enrichment programs, alternative approaches to .remediation,. and integration of GrosVentre and Assiniboine cultures within STEM program offerings represent highly original and creative components of this project.<br/>Other factors contributing to the intellectual merit of the project include the qualifications and experience of<br/>project leadership and the project.s unrestricted access to the institution.s full range of STEM resources.  The project was conceived during a two-year planning process, and its multiple components are clearly organized to achieve specific and measurable student-centered goals and objectives.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS<br/>Project activities will achieve many of the broader impacts described in NSF.s Grant Proposal Guide.  Pre-<br/>college enrichment sessions and reformed STEM course offerings will employ inquiry-based instruction to energize students with a spirit of discovery that will be reinforced through research and/or internship experiences addressing locally relevant, .real world. issues.  The project also will increase the participation of underrepresented minorities, specifically American Indians, in STEM academic programs and professions.  To encourage the success of American Indian students (who represent 85% of FBC.s student body), the project will employ instructional methods and learning activities that have proven effective among minority students, especially American Indians.  The broader impacts of the project will be felt far beyond Fort Belknap College through the project.s dissemination activities and through the societal impacts of faculty-student research projects and the project.s anticipated impact on the local<br/>work force."

First, Standards-Based Curriculum and Assessment Training will be offered at least twice per year to orient new-hires and to provide ongoing training in current developments in standards based curriculum and assessment for all teachers. For the last two years the target<br/>schools have synchronized their academic calendars to facilitate these professional development sessions and currently the schools are working on synchronizing the next academic year's calendar as well.  Now that the Standards-Based Curricula is in place, the focus has shifted to appropriate evaluation. Training in alternative assessment will be conducted three times per year, with the goal of all math and science teachers in the<br/>target schools attending at least one of the sessions each year.  FBCRSI will coordinate the development of a Summer Institute for Math and Science teachers.  Second, since the bulk of accomplishments over the first five years has been at the elementary level, it is now time to focus on the secondary level and on the pre-service teacher program at Fort Belknap College. This slight shift in focus will insure that the<br/>FBCRSI is providing services to the entire target population on the Fort Belknap Reservation at grades K-14. This will not only increase student achievement in math and science at the secondary level, but will also increase the number of Native Americans who choose math or science teaching as a career.  Third, the FBCRSI will expand its efforts in student achievement by coordinating and facilitating enrichment activities that include: Standards-Based After School Programs, Saturday Academies, and Summer School Programs. These programs will be customized for each target school student population to assist the students with remediation and/or enrichment activities to help all students achieve at high levels.  Fourth, the now-established FBCRSI program will continue with its successful RSI Steering Committee, which represents all targeted school populations in math and science.  Program personnel will expand efforts to provide leadership for the various<br/>programs and departments within the reservation that will lead to more cooperation and less duplication of efforts.  FBCRSI will work collaboratively with all other RSI programs in Montana and statewide educational agencies/programs to coordinate shared activities, leverage resources, and share effective practices that have optimal impact on student achievement.<br/><br/>"
