This proposal seeks to address the chronic underrepresentation of American Indian graduates in SMET education in a variety of ways. The primary goals of the proposal are: a) to increase the enrollment of Native American students into SMET disciplines, b) increase the numbers of Native American graduates from SMET fields, especially in education, c) develop the SMET research infrastructure at Blackfeet Community College, and d) build up the Information Technology program at Blackfeet College as the funding force behind the first two goals. Several objectives will be implemented as these goals are realized. New SMET faculty positions will be created and funded in part through the proposal. The collaborative ties between Blackfeet Community College (BCC), and Montana State University-Northern will be strengthened. These two partners will develop a joint curriculum in Information Technology that is friendly to Native American students. The Information Technology degree program at BCC will be enhanced with new courses, new capabilities, and additional personnel. Professional development activities will be conducted for the entire BCC faculty for the purpose of integrating IT across the curriculum. Key SMET programs at BCC, such as the Ethnobotanical Greenhouse, the Weather and Water Lab, and the DNA Mapping Lab, will be targeted as IT supported research areas, and student interns will be funded to help with the research.  Research internships will also be set up at MSU-Northern for American Indians who transfer into baccalaureate degree programs in SMET and IT education. A series of Summer Session BRIDGE activities for Blackfeet Reservation high school and college students will be jointly hosted by BCC and MSU-Northern at the MSU-Northern campus in Havre. This is an ambitious project that will serve as a model for others who desire to use some or all of the various activities that this proposal will encompass.<br/><br/>The PIITA project will be a five year, $2 million dollar effort that will significantly impact the numbers of American Indian students graduating with SMET related degrees. Specifically, the project staff will assist at least 30 American Indian students to graduate with baccalaureate degrees in SMET fields of study, with an emphasis toward IT and education, during the next five years.  These graduates will effectively raise the pool of American Indian IT educators in Montana by 500 percent or more.<br/><br/>The proposal has provisions for retaining an external evaluator, and nominal support for an advisory committee.  The eight member advisory committee will be recruited from educators and administrators from BCC, MSU-Northern, school disricts in the Blackfeet Reservation area, other Montana tribal colleges, and from the Blackfeet Community.  The evaluator and the committee will meet quarterly with the project PI's."

Having been a part of the earlier challenge to coordinate systemic reform efforts for several Indian reservations in five states, BCC-RSI proposes to concentrate its reform efforts on the Blackfeet Reservation, which consists of approximately 1.5 million acres of land located in Glacier County in north central Montana.  The current population on the reservation is approximately 9,000 people.  Two separate school districts (Browning and Heart Butte) located within the boundaries of the reservation serve approximately 1,900 students.  BCC-RSI proposes to service all of the three schools from the Heart Butte School District and five of eight schools from the Browning School District.  Of these eight schools, the efforts of BCC-RSI would impact 98% of the K-8 Indian student population and 100% of the Indian high school students on the Blackfeet Reservation.  The BCC-RSI proposes to continue to impact student achievement in schools on the reservation by promoting the NSF drivers in addition to addressing the social/cultural needs of the students and teachers that were identified during their development efforts."

The reservation                       wide conference will include:  education policy makers such                     as school board members and district administrators, Bureau                     of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service officials,                          Tribal Elders, Montana State University personnel, and                          officials from the Office of Public Instruction; nationally                     known Indian educators and scientists; local teachers,                          parents and students.  The focus will be the current state                      of math/science education on the Blackfeet Reservations.                        The summer workshops for 16 teachers and 10 students will                       study new methods for improving math/science education among                    American Indian students and adaptation of activities to the                    Blackfeet culture.  The academic year workshops will                            acquaint 20 educators with nationally known math/science                        curriculum projects; their content and pedagogy.

Special emphasis will be placed on a holistic<br/>approach to community reform using RSI activities as a springboard for a comprehensive<br/>reform effort.<br/><br/>There are fourteen K-8 schools (1,814 students) and two high schools (563 students) in the<br/>service area of BCC. BCC will work with eight of these schools in a comprehensive effort<br/>for systemic reform, impacting 1,777 (98%) in the K-8 area and 563 (100%) of the High<br/>School students. BCC will work with mathematics and science teachers and administrators<br/>through existing channels established during Phase I in setting goals and objectives for<br/>Phase I implementation activities. A task force made up of reservation school<br/>administrators will be chaired by the BCC college administrator and will include all<br/>school administrators of schools served. A mathematics task force will be developed and<br/>will include area mathematics instructors (recommended by school site administrators) and<br/>BCC mathematics instructors. It is this group that will examine, recommend, and assess<br/>efforts in mathematics. Another task force in the sciences will be formed composed of all<br/>service area science teachers and BCC science instructors. They will work closely with<br/>the science curriculum of area schools and look at how they are involved in the overall<br/>reform effort.<br/><br/>The Phase II developmental efforts will continue to promote systemic reform in math<br/>and science education at two school districts consisting of six different school buildings<br/>located in rural Montana. The utmost goal of the program is to develop and maintain a<br/>population that is prepared to meet the needs of a technologically competent work force.<br/><br/>"
