This project is recruiting participants from among current students majoring in CSEM disciplines and those who have not declared a major, high school seniors, students at local adult schools and through referrals from community agencies.  Emphasis is being placed on the recruitment of students who are members of populations underrepresented in CSEM disciplines.  Selection of scholarship recipients is based on required basic eligibility criteria, coupled with academic achievement and maturity as evidenced by community commitment.  The project is administered through NJCATE, an NSF-ATE funded center of excellence in technician education.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This project builds upon the successes of an earlier CSEMS project.  Of the 57 scholarship recipients in that project, 43.9% (25) graduated and are pursuing bachelors' degrees in a CSEM disciplines (as compared to 15.9% for the College).  Additionally, 38.6% (22) are still enrolled and eligible for scholarships.  One-third (19) of the scholarship recipients began as developmental education students who initially were awarded scholarships in escrow.  The college's typical remediation success rate is 50% while that of the scholarship in escrow recipients is 100%. <br/> <br/>Specific objectives of the NJCATE Scholars program are to:<br/>(a) increase the enrollment of high-ability, low-income students, particularly those from populations underrepresented in CSEM disciplines. <br/>(b) increase the retention and graduation rates of students in CSEM disciplines. <br/>(c) enhance transfer opportunities for scholarship recipients. <br/>(d) strengthen partnerships between the college and high technology industry to provide students with career experiences and support. <br/><br/>The scholars participate in a variety of support activities to enhance retention and success.  Scholarships held in escrow for CSEM majors enrolled in development education coursework encourage persistence to credit courses.  Faculty advising, group meetings, and career and transfer workshops are designed to form the basis of a learning community of scholars that provide mutual support and encouragement.  A seamless web of existing support services will buttress targeted support.  A Steering Committee of faculty and administrators from involved academic and support departments oversee project implementation. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  58% of the students supported with the first grant were minority students. This significant increase demonstrates the impact of financial assistance coupled with targeted support in encouraging the enrollment and success of students from underrepresented populations in CSEM disciplines. Additionally, financial need is often a strong barrier to completion of degrees among students from both minority and majority populations.  Scholarship support reduces the need for outside employment and enables students to focus more intently on studies, reducing the time for degree completion. <br/> <br/><br/>"

The microscopy equipment that was used in the Materials Laboratory was limited to the extent that only one person could view the image at any given time. The instructor's ability to provide a meaningful answer to any questions the student asked about the structure was dependent upon the student's ability to describe what was seen. The new use of a video camera and console allows for a more positive identification of and discussion of the observed microstructure, since both student and instructor view the structure simultaneously. Other students benefit from the discussion of the microstructure in question, and all can see that structure. The imaging equipment is giving the student greater flexibility in obtaining photographic images for inclusion in laboratory reports. Using the video camera and digital printer allows making a hard copy without moving the specimen from one instrument to another. Since the digital images are less expensive as compared with the photographic methods currently used, time and money saved allow the individual student to make increased use of the microscopy equipment."

Numerous reports and studies have deplored the low level of scientific and technological literacy in our society. College students enrolled in non technical majors programs are required to take mathematics and science courses to fulfill general education requirement for graduation, but these courses bear no relationship to their major program. Additionally, for the most part, the mathematics, science and technology courses that are available to fulfill general education requirements for majors in social science, humanities and business programs are designed to meet the needs of the mathematics and science-based majors and are of little interest to non-science majors. The goal of the project is to provide non-science majors with the breadth and depth of understanding in mathematics, science and technology to enable them to participate as informed citizens in discussion and decisions on critical issues facing the nation. The College will take an interdisciplinary, integrated systems approach that fosters understanding of a variety of mathematics and science concepts in an applied context and that is grounded in issues and problems that have a science concepts in an applied context and that is grounded in issues and problems that have a clear impact on the lives of students and can, thus, be seen to be relevant by the most""unscientific"". It will incorporate the integration of social science and humanities concepts to provide a context for consideration of the social import of the mathematics and science concepts presented. To accomplish this goal, faculty, working in interdisciplinary teams will create, pilot-test and implement module-based courses that incorporate instruction in mathematics, science and technology within the context of two themes: the environment and telecommunications. These courses will form the models to an additional four themes tha t will be developed by the College subsequent to this project. These integrated offerings will replace current curricula choices for non-science majors. The restructured curricula will provide non-science majors with opportunities for learning mathematics, science and technology that are relevant and meaningful. As a result, students will be more likely to continue to learn and read about current issues in which the sciences and technology play major roles, and will be capable of making informed decisions regarding scientific and technological questions. The College has individually, and consortium with other institutions, participated in major mathematics and science education initiatives to ensure that both students enrolling in programs and those graduating, have the knowledge and technical skills necessary for successful employment and further education. This project is an extension of those efforts"

Multimedia refers to information that combines more than one medium. Every segment of the industry is growing quickly and has the potential for future growth. Networked multimedia communications will have a broad impact on business, education, and on communications in general Examples of networked multimedia communications include videotelephony and videoconferencing, real-time video on demand, interactive video and multimedia messaging, remote collaborative work, interactive information services and multimedia education and training. Middlesex County College and the Carteret public schools will work, mver a two-year period, with representatives from the Siemens Rolm Corporation and York Telecom to develop and implement an articulated curriculum to prepare multimedia communications technicians for employment and continuing education. Building on an established, ABET-accredited electrical engineering technology program with a computer electronics option, the College will develop and implement a curriculum that provides a sound foundation in core and technical skills and knowledge, as well as the foundation interpersonal skills and knowledge that respond to industry needs. The overall goal of the project is to develop and implement a high school through associate degree program in Multimedia Communications Technology to satisfy the needs of business and industry for highly-skilled, well-educated technicians, and, at the same time, prepare graduates for further education. An existing articulation relationship with the New Jersey Institute of Technology will serve as a vehicle to extend Multimedia Communications Technology articulation through the baccalaureate degree. The education of technicians, described as the employees who ""understand how the process operates in its entirety and are ready to intervene if trouble arises,"" is a critical component in the revitalization of American business and industry. Where once an employee was expected to do a job without reference to what others were doing, now ""teamwork, communication skills, breadth of knowledge, initiative, versatility and leadership skills"" are basic requirements for employees at all levels. Just as business and industry, to remain viable, have moved to a concentration on quality, so too must technician education restructure for quality. Key elements in the design of the curriculum structure will be the inclusion of methodologies and techniques that promote the development of team building and creative problem-solving skills. Collaborative learning, project-centered instructional activities and authentic assessment derived from the completion of real-life projects will form the curricular framework for the Multimedia Communications Technology program. The multimedia communications technician must have a background rooted in electronics and computer technology, with a strong foundation in mathematics, science, and written and oral communications, as well as the ability to participate as a team member in a quality-focused work environment. This background, coupled with a knowledge of graphic design, will prepare multimedia communications program graduates for careers in this new field."
