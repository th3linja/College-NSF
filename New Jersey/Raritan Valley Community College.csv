This is particularly important in the areas of building automation, commercial energy auditing, building commissioning and retro-commissioning.  This shortage is bound to become more acute over the next few years as current HVAC technicians in the commercial and industrial fields start reaching retirement age, and as the field of building construction advances and grows.  Raritan Valley Community College's CEM-Tech program aims to develop curricula and student experiences that will help to meet this shortage.  This will be done working closely with industry experts.  The goal is preparing students and incumbent workers in Sustainable Building Operations.  <br/><br/>Raritan Valley Community College will work to develop an industry-aligned curriculum following rigorous academic standards, a campus as a living laboratory model, and strengthening core curriculum for general education.  The end product being a Certificate and an AAS degree in Commercial Energy Management Technology.  Industry partners and like-minded community and four-year colleges have been invited to join in a collaborative effort where curriculum-development best practices and the sharing of resources will be emphasized.  A portfolio of stand-alone seminars with stackable credentials will be developed for both facilities managers and incumbent workers.  Transfer pathways will also be developed for high school students, incumbent workers, and managers.  A special focus will be placed on developing strategies to reach minorities and under-represented populations.  Following the recommendation of industry partner, new laboratories will be equipped with state-of-the-art hardware, software, and instrumentation that is relevant in the field. The outputs of this effort will be available for nationwide dissemination and sharing."

Approximately 34 scholars will participate in the learning community, which is designed to improve students' educational experiences and connection to peers, faculty and the college, all with the objective of increasing STEM retention, degree achievement and successful transfer to four-year institutions.  Partnerships among multiple stakeholders (high schools, 4-year institutions, community organizations, and local employers) will support a well-rounded plan for recruitment, retention, and then placement in the workforce or colleges and universities that grant bachelor's degrees. This project is expected to have an impact on the number of STEM graduates prepared to help national, regional, and local companies compete and innovate in the global economy.  <br/><br/>The project will investigate the influence of i) improved academic and social integration and ii) improvement in economic circumstances on educational outcomes for academically talented STEM students with demonstrated financial need. In addition to expanding efforts to nurture a STEM learning community (see activities above), the quality and rigor of assessment and evaluation activities will be enhanced in order to test whether efforts to help students assimilate and financial assistance can explain their retention and commitment  to complete STEM majors.  Formative evaluation will address scholars' satisfaction with the project and its contribution towards their satisfaction with the institution, their educational progression, and their career development.  Summative evaluation will consist of an analysis of the alignment of retention and enrollment with the project objectives.  In addition an analysis will be done on the long-term effects of the project on student placement in college or in the workforce and persistence in STEM fields. Dissemination of the results of evaluation will be done through conferences and workshops focused on higher education and pedagogy. Potential conferences include the Faculty of the Future conference held annually at Bucks County Community College and Best Practices Conference in New York City sponsored by the Institute of International Education."

This faculty development project has  at its core an intensive study group program for eight faculty  members from Raritan Valley Community College (RVCC) and Somerset  County Technical Institute (SCTI).  The program will enable the  faculty to integrate into the standard curriculum attention to  the ethical and value aspects of science and engineering.  To  achieve its goals and to disseminate results and provide a model  for others to consider, the program involves a collaboration  among faculty at RVCC and SCTI, the New Jersey Institute of  Technology, and high schools, industries, and other consortia  involved in advancing science and engineering education in the  region and the nation.  The project uses an across the curriculum  methodology that involves the faculty in the process of  discovering ways of modifying their standard classroom  presentations in order better to prepare students for their  careers.  The participants will meet with an expert on ethics and  science and technology who will provide advice and instruction on  approaches to ethical decisionmaking concerning science and  technology and on developing classroom environments that foster  the analytical, conceptual and social skills necessary to  encourage ethical reflection in undergraduate students in  scientific, engineering, and technical courses.  Individual core  faculty, assisted by other experts if appropriate, will conduct  weekly seminars on particular issues of science, engineering and  ethics during the Fall semester.  A day-long open workshop on  ethics and effective working relationships between industry and  academia will end the Fall semester program.  The Spring program  will recruit eight additional group members for weekly seminars  and monthly curriculum development activiti es.  At the end of  that semester, faculty, students, and members of the commuhnity  will be invited to participate in a week-long program on  ""Technology across the Curriculum,"" and a day-long program for  high school faculty will be designed to make them aware of  opportunities to consider ethics issues in science curricula.   Program activities and results will be disseminated in a wide  variety of ways.  Newsletters will keep faculty at the involved  institutions informed.  Statewide, results will be made available  through the New Jersey Institute for Collegiate Teaching and  Learning, which is a state funded project to disseminate ideas  through publications and faculty and staff development workshops.   In the state and more broadly, information will be made available  through the Statewide Systematic Initiative for Achieving  Excellence in Mathematics, Science, and Technology Education,  through the NJ Mathematics Coalition and the Academic Officers  Association of the Community Colleges, and through the  MidAtlantic Consortium for Math and Science Education.  Project  results will also be disseminated nationally at appropriate  conferences and through appropriate journals.   ***"
