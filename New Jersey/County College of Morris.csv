Annual surveys of SMET graduates from 1994-98 with very high response rates show that over 91% report being employed, enrolled in 4-year institutions, or both.  In 1989, CCM created its Horizons Program dedicated to the needs of students with learning disabilities (sld), that has grown from 35 participants to over 500 with 38% coming from 9 other counties.  CCM has also developed a successful system for providing tailored services to students with physical disabilities (spd) and an active Disability Awareness Committee.  Adaptive equipment and software are used to make its state-of-the-art SMET classrooms and laboratories accessible, and special tutoring is provided as needed.  An analysis of the limited individual data available on CCM's sld and spd reveals that CCM is providing SMET programs that are attractive, but they point out issues that deserve investigation relating to noticeable clustering of these students in a very limited number of SMET programs. <br/><br/>The overall goal of the proposed project is to create increased inclusionary SMET education opportunities for students with disabilities (swd) that should attract more of these students into SMET programs and careers. The various components to accomplish this are in-place (i.e. quality SMET programs and faculty, an established Tech Prep Consortium of secondary schools, and proven assistance programs for swd).  The specific objectives of the proposed KISMET project are to:<br/><br/>Upgrade CCM's capacity to provide SMET education to students with disabilities by:  <br/>(1) improving articulation and transition coordination with secondary schools,  <br/>(2) orienting faculty toward inclusionary thinking regarding this population, and  <br/>(3) increasing the availability of support services and assistive equipment.<br/>Develop more ""swd friendly"" delivery of SMET curricula, including training faculty in identified successful techniques.<br/>Improve the tracking of swd SMET enrollees and their progress at CCM as a means to both learn ""what works"" for this population and better serve individual swd.<br/>Increase first-time enrollments, retention and persistence to graduation by swd in SMET programs, including decreased abandonment of SMET for non-SMET majors.<br/><br/>The project will use a New Transition Coordination Outreach Initiative to Secondary Schools, a Special Recruitment Effort, a Faculty Task Force to Improve SMET Curricula Delivery, Faculty/Staff Development activities, and Additional Direct Assistance. <br/><br/>"

This shift to data-driven decision making is creating a growing workforce demand for Data Science and Analytics professionals.  In a 2018 report, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that jobs in data science and analytics will grow 34% by 2026.  However, thus far, very few two-year institutions offer data analytics programs that could prepare students for entry-level positions in data science and analytics.  To create new pathways into data science and analytics careers, this project intends to establish a college credit-based certificate in data analytics.  In concert with this goal, it also aims to increase the College?s capacity for high quality data science instruction and to broaden participation in data science, with a focus on inclusion of women.  In addition to its potential to increase the capacity and quality of the data science workforce in New Jersey, the project may also provide a model for other institutions that are interested in building new data science programs. <br/><br/>The major goal of the project is to develop a 15-credit data science certificate that integrates technology such as R, Tableau, Python, and SQL into the curriculum.  Less than 20 community college-based data science programs appear to exist in the US, and this certificate is believed to be the first at any community college in the greater New York/New Jersey metropolitan area.  The curriculum will be informed by an industry advisory committee and implement national recommendations for data science education, including teaching statistics thinking, integrating real data with a context and a purpose, and using project-based learning.  The project intends to recruit women into the field through collaboration with the College?s Women in STEM Club, R-Ladies Global, and faculty development.  The resulting certification will prepare students to enter the workforce as data analytics professionals, or to transfer to four-year programs where they can acquire the advanced credentials needed for mid- to high-level data scientist positions.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The college involved in this project is an established leader in associate degree level science education and has been offering quality programs in Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics. Annual surveys of CSEM graduates from 1994-97 with very high response rates indicate that over 95% were employed, enrolled in 4-year IHEs, or both.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to increase the number of academically talented but financially disadvantaged persons, particularly Blacks, Latinos and women, enrolling full-time in CSEM Associate degree programs and completing their degrees as preparation for CSEM careers and further higher education. The project uses a combination of expanded scholarship opportunities, a special recruitment effort, and a support network delivering assistive services to 1) cut the three-year success rate gap between minorities and majority CSEM students in stages by two-thirds and 2) increase the three-year graduation rate for women CSEM majors in stages by 25% from the 1991-95 IPEDS averages, plus 3) increase the number of racial/ethnic minorities and women enrolling as first time full-time CSEM students in stages by 25% from the the 1994-98 IPEDS averages for each group.<br/><br/>A distinctive feature of this ""Start Right"" Program is the partner community agencies serving as ""linking pins"" to the cluster communities of Blacks and Latinos in nearby towns, providing assistance in recruiting and serving as neighborhood-based support sites. Project directors envision a mentoring continuum linking the college's current efforts to programs run by these agencies, with e-mail being a key tool to increase contact between mentors and CSEM students. They hope to establish Online Outposts at these agencies to host workshops for parents and other events and also to serve as mentoring, peer tutoring and carpool sites. <br/><br/><br/>"

Partnerships with Industry Alliance Committee members are increasing student internship offerings and utilizing industry feedback to align key courses with industry needs and therefore establishing a feedback mechanism that continually improves student outcomes. Increasing internship participation rates for all students and aligning key courses with industry needs contributes highly trained entry-level employees into the local technology economy. The PACE program addresses students in need of remediation and improves the retention of all students by using Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) activities in selected courses. POGIL activities engage students in higher levels of thinking and collaborative group learning. It is a proven pedagogy that promotes many skills employers seek: teamwork, communication, problem solving, strong work ethic, analytical approach, taking initiative, critical thinking and time management. By implementing POGIL, technology students are more active in their learning and are better equipped with useful skills to enter the workforce. The PACE Science Program allows CCM to meet the needs of the STEM economy and the alliance with local industries demonstrates the success of the project by the number of prepared technicians produced and successfully employed."
