Recent natural disaster, such as the Mississippi basin flooding, demonstrate that a greater awareness of the forces of nature and the principles of open channel flow are needed in our society to plan and develop better optimum infrastructures. This project integrates physical laboratory experimentation in hydraulics and data acquisition techniques with engineering calculations to facilitate the graphical/pictorial and animation power of the computer to create an integrated multivisual presentation. The laboratory setting, part of the Civil Engineering Technology and Environmental Studies program at the colleges, is analogous to a modern day process ""control room"" with multiple displays providing student groups with the capability for interactive learning. Students receive different perspectives of data, relevant equation, experimental dynamics, visual enimation, and actual real-world photos/videos of the phenomena under study. System integration requires the utilization of an open channel testing flume structure; computer hardware and software; optical discs; and software (media) production processes to develop a coherent story-line and interactive presentation of the experiment for on- line student understanding. As part of this project, students are being exposed to problems of environmentally related channel flow as experienced in the area. Project outcomes are suitable for demonstrations to K-12 secondary public school students, to motivate interest in science and technology."
