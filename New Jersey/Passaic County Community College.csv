The College is a publicly supported associate degree institution with a student body of 4000. The College intends to connect to the Internet through Bell Atlantic, a local Internet service provider. The campus needs the Internet connection to be able to access information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world. The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of this institution as well as the community in general. The award provides partial support of the project for two years."

It is expected that B2B alliances provide a bridge to the baccalaureate degree for STEM students from underrepresented populations who begin their instruction at a community college. The Northern New Jersey Bridges to the Baccalaureate (NNJ-B2B) Alliance is a partnership of five, public, associate-degree granting, Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) in northern New Jersey: Passaic County Community College (lead institution), Bergen Community College, Hudson County Community College, Middlesex County College, and Union County College. NNJ-B2B will work synergistically with the Garden State LSAMP (GS-LSAMP) Program to increase the number of students underrepresented in STEM who successfully transfer from the five partner community colleges to STEM programs at four-year institutions in New Jersey. By assisting more than 900 students from underrepresented populations transition into baccalaureate STEM degree programs at institutions in the GS-LSAMP, the partner colleges in NNJ-B2B will provide their students with access to more employment opportunities thereby resulting in a more diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce.<br/><br/>According to A Matter of Degrees, a recent study conducted by the Center for Community College Student Engagement, ""community college students who participate in multiple high impact practices are more engaged in their learning and experience better outcomes than students who do not participate in these activities."" In collaboration GS-LSAMP, NNJ-B2B partners will require that students participate in a powerful set of STEM learning experiences that will instill in them the motivation, skills, and experiences needed to succeed in their STEM coursework and transfer to the universities. The STEM learning experiences will include the following five high impact practices: undergraduate research, peer led team learning (PLTL), Math Bridge programs, peer mentoring, and career/transfer seminars. Each of the NNJ-B2B Alliance partners will serve as the lead in developing, refining, and sharing one of five best practices modules and will then commit to replicating all five high impact practices on their respective campuses. The activities of the NNJ-B2B Alliance will result in improved STEM education on the partner campuses and an increased transfer rate into STEM baccalaureate degree programs."

PCCC leads the alliance which includes two new community colleges - UCM, an emerging Hispanic-serving community college, and HCCC during the three-year project. The goal is to increase the number of transfers by 900 students during the project period. <br/><br/>NNJ-B2B institutions will leverage knowledge generated from prior NSF funded projects to bring expertise to the design and implementation of a range of high impact practices that will aide in achieving its transfer goal and transform its recruitment and retention interventions and institutions.  Students will benefit from early undergraduate research experiences and mentoring activities in addition to social integration activities with institutions in the Garden State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation led by Rutgers University.  Leadership and governance activities of the alliance will continue emphasis on improving articulation policies with four-year institutions. A longitudinal study of students participating in the B2B project since 2014 is proposed along with process evaluation.  Project outcomes will be disseminated locally and nationally through conferences and on-line STEM education journals. Findings from this LSAMP B2B project will benefit educational institutions and the STEM community nationally in broadening participation efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposal requests funds to upgrade the laboratory component of the course by acquiring computer-based physiological equipment. Five complete workstations will be established, each equipped with a personal computer, printer and Intelitool sensors and interfaces. The equipment will permit students to perform hands-on experiments in electrocardiography, spirometry, muscle physiology and reflex physiology. The project is designed to increase scientific interest within the general student population and improve the scientific competencies of those students intending to pursue a career in science."
