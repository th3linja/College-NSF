The project includes six disciplines: Chemistry, Civil Construction Engineering Technology, Engineering, Manufacturing Engineering Technology, Mathematics, and Biology. <br/><br/>Cultivating the STEM is a comprehensive effort that employs the following strategies : 1) expansion of the Hewlett Packard-MESA Center, including the development of individual academic plans, tutoring opportunities, participation in Academic Excellence Workshops that feature study skills and time management,  and a faculty mentoring program working with small groups of students in laboratories; 2) a high school educational outreach initiative that exposes secondary students to the STEM fields and uses contextual learning to address their developmental needs, a ""bridge in"" program; and 3) a ""bridge out"" program that provides students with cooperative education internships in scientific industries after the first year of study.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project is its use of a holistic approach to scientific education through immersing the student in a culture and environment that addresses his/her academic needs. The program identifies variables that may serve as barriers and impediments to academic success and provides interventions to address those obstacles. This project also is attempting to change the way in which STEM curriculum areas are taught by responding to the different learning styles and needs of students.<br/><br/><br/>"
