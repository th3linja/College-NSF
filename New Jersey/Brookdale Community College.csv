The new programs with multiple entry and exit points will prepare technicians for the wireless communications industry.<br/><br/>The project components include curriculum development and adaptation and program development, professional development for high school and community college faculty, and development of 2+2+2 articulation in wireless communications. As an NCTT regional partner, the project staff is working to implement similar programs throughout the region and generally contribute to program development and improvement at collaborating institutions. In addition, this ATE project serves as the focal point for regional dissemination and training to regional business and industry, through the development of materials and faculty.<br/><br/>Besides NCTT, strategic partnerships for this project include the National Workforce Center for Emerging Technologies (NWCET), The New Jersey Center for Advanced Technological Education (NJCATE) and the Global Wireless Education Consortium (GWEC). Other project partnerships have been established with post-secondary institutions, area technical high schools, and regional industry.<br/><br/><br/>"

This proposed project is in alignment with the National Defense Authorization Act of 2018. Through cohort-based learning, SFS scholars at each of the four-partner colleges will collaborate on activities and events, including student skills competitions, certification preparation workshops, visits to local federal agencies, and participation in job fairs. Experiential learning will allow students to gain skills from real cybersecurity vulnerabilities and attacks experienced by businesses and organizations. SCC is designated as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense 2-Year Education (CAE-2Y) and MVCC is an Advanced Technical Education (ATE) National Resource Center.<br/><br/>The program will be based on several successful adult learning practices: cohort learning, experiential learning, competency-based education, and one-on-one, holistic student support. The objectives are to: 1) research, develop, and document new strategic roles community colleges can play in increasing the number of cybersecurity professionals employed in government sectors; 2) build effective collaborations between educational institutions, business, industry, and government; 3) prepare 24 Scholars For Service (SFS) to help meet government need for highly qualified cybersecurity professionals; 4) disseminate best practice models designed for replication by other colleges across the country, including: new protocols for conducting prior learning assessments to assist veterans in applying their education and experience to cybersecurity disciplines; and best practices for recruiting, selecting, and supporting non-cybersecurity Bachelor degree students through cybersecurity education programs (cohort models and success coaching).<br/><br/>Co-funding for this project is provided from the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) and NSF Scholarships in STEM (S-STEM) programs, reflecting alignment of the project with major emphases of the ATE program on involvement of community colleges and the S-STEM program on financial and co-curricular support for high-achieving students with demonstrated financial need.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It includes a unique public-private partnership that leverages the agility of community colleges and the course material of the SANS Institute to develop a scalable, competition-driven, hands-on education model that has a potential to help with the nation's critical shortage of cybersecurity workforce. The project designs metrics to identify individuals with the appropriate aptitude and expose them to vital, in-depth, hands-on learning model focusing on defending computer systems and networks. The project utilizes a multiphase competition-based model and, at each stage, students compete to demonstrate their competence and to advance to the next phase of the program. Students who successfully complete all components of the program and demonstrate their mastery have the opportunity to apply for residency positions where they can hone their skills working with practicing security professionals on real-world projects. The proposed competition and residency based model for developing the cybersecurity technical talent has a real potential for dissemination and implementation in a large number of the 1,200 community colleges nationwide."

The project advances the creation and adoption of interactive instructional materials within the ATE community simultaneously providing students engaging, interactive content and addressing spiraling textbook costs. Workshops and a self-paced online course will train educators to create interactive content using free and relatively inexpensive tools and empower them to develop their own interactive, immersive and engaging learning elements and share what they have learned and developed with colleagues and students.<br/><br/>The project will positively impact teaching and learning by infusing interactivity with purpose to help students grasp difficult concepts and increase the number of students successfully completing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs. Existing NSF centers and projects and industry contributors will be solicited to provide content for interactive materials and review the materials developed. Significant efforts will also be made to engage faculty and institutions that serve underrepresented populations. Collaboration with five ATE national centers will impact a significant number of students and faculty, including the participating subject matter experts (SMEs) and their students as well as colleges, high schools and individual faculty associated with these centers and the ATE community at-large. Underrepresented populations will be reached through existing outreach efforts of these partners, face-to-face workshops at predominantly minority-serving institutions and via promotion of the self-paced online course to organizations, publications and social media connected with educators and institutions that serve traditionally underrepresented populations."

To leverage this connection, this project is creating a generic framework for the development of e-books and mobile applications in STEM education. The framework is initially used to create e-books and mobile apps for Photonics and Networking courses in conjunction with content experts at two National ATE Centers of Excellence. The framework consists of templates, sample code, documentation and other materials that are enabling faculty and institutions to create their own e-books and mobile apps. The framework development is broad-based, covering iOS, Android, and web-based platforms for maximizing adoption. The two ATE Center partners work closely with the project's team to ensure the optimal integration of the best pedagogical approaches and technology to benefit student learning and to support faculty teaching using these new tools. Evaluation of the deliverables includes testing by both end users (students and faculty) and developers interested in using the project framework (other institutions), as well as assessing potential gains in student learning. The broader impact of the work is potentially substantial since users can download the e-books and mobile apps from the respective market places such as Apple's App Store, the Android Market, and amazon.com at much reduced costs than for traditional textbooks. Additional dissemination of the materials and framework is broad through the OP-TEC and ICT Centers, as well as a website and workshops, forums, and presentations at national conferences."
