Scholars are selected based on potential for academic achievement, financial need, citizenship, full-time enrollment in a STEM program and recommendations from counselors, teachers or community leaders. Program objectives include recruiting underrepresented students and providing academic support services to ensure scholars' successful retention to degree attainment and transfer.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit is evidenced by the qualifications and experience of the PIs, faculty and administration commitment, the range of academic enrichment activities, and collaboration with businesses and community-based organizations. Program components build upon the existing infrastructure for student support services, industry partnerships, and articulation agreements with four-year institutions. Faculty mentoring, academic advisement, monitoring of academic progress, tutoring, supplemental instruction, field trips to local industry sites, career planning, communication and critical thinking skills workshops, cooperative education, and transfer advisement support this learning community approach.  <br/><br/>Broader impact is reflected in the collaborative efforts of the various team members to attract underrepresented students into STEM programs and increase their retention, graduation and transfer rates.  Presentations at professional meetings disseminate program results. The long-term benefit to society is an increase in the diversity of qualified individuals prepared to meet the workforce needs in high demand STEM fields.<br/>"

Basic theory and hands-on use of the GC/MS begins in the Organic and General Chemistry courses, where it enhances the science experience of both biotechnology majors and traditional science majors. In addition, GC/MS is being implemented in the Chemistry and Society courses for non-science majors, the new Biochemistry courses (part of the biotechnology program), and Forensic Chemistry. In collaboration with the county police academy (located on campus) and the state forensics laboratory, students are using the instrument in real-life forensic applications. To maximize the implementation of technology across the curriculum, this project also includes extensive faculty development activities in the use, calibration, and maintenance of the GC/MS, as well as industrial field experiences for faculty at area Biotechnology companies. Focusing on inquiry-based learning improves student understanding of important science principles by reinforcing these principles with industry-related demonstrations and experiments.  With the adaptation and implementation of lab experiments across the curriculum, the students have repetitive use of the equipment and gain a familiarity with the techniques and computer systems used in an industry setting. This instrumentation is having a significant effect in raising the quality and scope of the science experience of two-year college students, facilitating inquiry-based learning and fostering critical thinking and problem solving skills. Appropriate assessment of project activities is being conducted throughout the project to measure improvements in student learning.  This project is having an impact beyond the biotechnology program at Camden County College. It is enhancing each course in the chemistry curriculum, and also cuts across disciplines, affecting courses such as genetics (biology), clinical chemistry and immunology (clinical lab science) as well as courses for the allied health majors.  As a result, students, especially women and minorities, are being better prepared to enter the job market directly, or transfer to a four-year institution to continue their education. Most importantly, this project is providing the surrounding tri-state region (New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware) with sorely needed, well-trained bio-technicians."

One of the basic  characteristics of technical education curricula is its ability to  respond to rapidly changing technology. New developments must be  incorporated into the curriculum so that graduates of these  programs can compete for jobs and meet not only the present needs  but also the future needs of their employers.  Key to this success  is the acquisition of equipment for the development of a long  wavelength (850 to 1550 nm) fiber-optic advanced laboratory for  communication and power transmission. Long fiber-optic wavelengths  are extremely important to study because of recent discoveries and  advances made in fiber-optic communications. The long fiber-optic  equipment in the near infra-red range and beyond will permit  students to make comparisons to other popular wavelengths now in  use.  The development of a long wavelength advanced fiber-optic  laboratory will assure that fiber-optic graduates will be properly  prepared for immediate employment now and in the foreseeable  future.  Long wave fiber-optic systems are now being studied by a  number of universities and communications industries, i.e. A.T. &  T., for the development of a global highway."

This overall         range is important because of the current interest in applications in           fusion, medicine, and thin films.  Students gain experience in                  determining the attenuation of ultraviolet wavelengths through a                variety of waveguides, testing different materials for absorption and           reflection properties, and the finding the effects on various animal            tissue samples and crystals.
