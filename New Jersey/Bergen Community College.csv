This project is designed to meet needs identified by industry employers, including a growing demand for interdisciplinary science technologists who can use a variety of analytical instruments and deal with the new employment realities of rapidly changing assignments, variable functions, and multicultural teams.  Community college faculty and expert advisors from four-year colleges and from high technology industry employers in the region will develop, implement, and evaluate a broad-based Interdisciplinary A.A. S. curriculum to:  <br/>1. Prepare students to effectively use a variety of modern laboratory equipment and analytical methods required by business and industry employers.<br/>2. Help students gain interactive classroom based experiential learning about work.<br/>3. Create interactive interdisciplinary learning modules that simulate workplace problems, activities, and assignments.<br/>4. Integrate laboratory internships, work based learning experiences, and mentor relationships.<br/>5. Arrange peer support groups and an array of academic supportive services that will ensure student retention, completion, and employment or further education, especially among under-represented populations.<br/>"

The program is increasing students' math and computer skills, basic laboratory skills, technical understanding of instrumentation, protocol writing, written and verbal communication skills as well as critical thinking skills. The courses are delivered via 8 hour labs supplemented by Adobe Acrobat Pro hosted webinar classes. Students learn Biomanufacturing technical skills as identified by an NSF supported survey and virtually all of the skills in the first four ladders of the U.S. Department of Labor's Advanced Manufacturing Competency Model using hands-on methods. The program is incorporating computer based training (Electronic Laboratory Notebooks) that ensures students are skilled in documentation and computer applications as required under FDA regulation 21 CFR Section 11. The Quality Assurance (QA) Technician Certificate program retrains and upgrades skills for incumbent workers and also provides a science pathway from secondary school to community college and higher education, meeting the Quality Control and Quality Assurance workforce needs of New Jersey's highly regulated and growing pharmaceutical, chemical, fragrance, food, and personal care industries. High school teachers are being trained to deliver QA courses in secondary schools for dual enrollment. Project partners include industry leaders, American Society for Quality, the Tri-County WIBs and One-Stop Career Centers, BioLink, BioMan, and others."
