The specific goal of this program will be to provide scholarships for academically talented students who have demonstrated financial need so that they can successfully graduate and/or transfer to a 4-year institution in a STEM field.  The central New Jersey community will benefit from the increased quality and numbers of graduates for the STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The objectives of the SAMS program will be to: 1) retain at least 75% of the scholars for the duration of the grant; 2) have 50% of the scholars be underrepresented minorities (URMs) or women in STEM disciplines; 3) have the scholars be enrolled full-time, participate in intervention and advising programs as a cohort, and be encouraged to participate in undergraduate research or be trained as a peer-tutor in their second year of the program; and 4) have 75% of the scholars successfully graduate or transfer from MCCC in the field of STEM. Highlights of additional recruitment and retention activities are: a high school summer bridge program, weekly cohort meetings focusing on college success and transfer strategies, one-on-one mentoring, weekly review sessions in STEM gateway courses, STEM seminars with focused discussion afterwards, undergraduate research with a presentation and peer-tutoring with certification. The program will be designed as a two-year selective program for a cohort of students featuring nationally recognized strategies to promote STEM success.<br/><br/>In terms of the broader impacts, providing scholarship opportunities to students who have demonstrated financial need will increase the retention rate as well as transfer and graduation rates in STEM programs. Low-income minority students and veterans will be a focus for the STEM scholarship program.  The proposed project will help students prepare for employment and/or transfer to four-year programs in the STEM fields."

Experience in DNA isolation, genetic testing, gene cloning, PCR, nucleic acid hybridization, phage genetics, and E. coli culturing and transformation enables students to understand molecular biology and biotechnology from a practical perspective. A number of laboratory exercises include Internet research. The revised laboratories impact not only all biology majors but also non-majors who elect to take biology to fulfill a laboratory science requirement. The educational goals of the project are four fold: 1) to improve scientific literacy in non- and biology majors; 2) to attract education and other majors to investigating additional laboratory courses in biology; 3) to attract and improve the retention rates of those students traditionally underrepresented in the sciences; and 4) to provide biology majors with the academic and technical background required for successful transfer to four year schools or for employment as technicians. The laboratory exercises are designed to encourage critical thinking and to provide hands-on experience within the framework of a small team. Modules are integrated so that concepts and practices learned in introductory laboratories are reinforced in advanced laboratories. In addition, students at the branch campus (located in downtown Trenton) engage in laboratories that emphasize experimentation, rather than observation of computer simulations."
