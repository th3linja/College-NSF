They have four basic goals including: the collection and processing of institutional data on recruitment, retention, and advancement of women in STEM; review available sources and models for institutional transformation; garner institutional support for transformation; and develop a comprehensive transformation plan.  Some of the strategies they will use to accomplish their goals are surveys, focus groups, guest speakers, and visits to other ADVANCE institutions.  Information about women in STEM at community colleges is lacking in the literature and as the largest community college system in the country, this proposal presents a unique opportunity to collect a large amount of information about this understudied population.  As designed, the potential for model building and significant data collection are outstanding.  The enormous role that community colleges play in the production of STEM professionals, including eventual PhD recipients and URM STEM professionals is well documented.  Understanding the hiring, retention, and promotion STEM women faculty in this setting would contribute greatly to the literature base."

Microtechnologies and nanotechnologies are needed in a broad range of products and industries. The primary purpose of the project is to broaden engineering technician education to prepare technicians to work in the microsystems industry. This project is designing and implementing a Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (Microsystems) Certificate for students enrolled in engineering technology or electrical engineering technology associate degree programs, as well as preparing them for LabVIEW certification (Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench, for data acquisition, instrument control, and industrial automation). Microsystems and LabVIEW certificates are supplementing and complementing associate degrees in engineering technology, creating broader employment opportunities for technicians and preparing a competent workforce for the microsystems industry. The Microsystems certificate and LabVIEW preparation created for this project are easily replicable in engineering technology programs in each of other regions in the state through the Ivy Tech System and in community colleges in other states. The college is continuing its partnership with SCME, adding a community college focus to their resources. This continuing partnership is assuring that the resources produced are being made available through the SCME national education and information dissemination channels. Project outreach activities include those specially designed to attract and retain to the program under-represented minorities, females, and veterans who already make-up a significant percentage of students at the college.<br/><br/>This project builds on an NSF ATE grant (1205138) to the Southwest Center for Microsystems Education (SCME). As a result, eleven hands-on educational course modules and kits produced by SCME are being integrated into engineering technology courses at the college. In this project the college and SME are co-developing three additional course modules and kits focused on building microsystems, which complement the learning modules developed by SCME. The college is also integrating preparation for the LabVIEW certification test into the new microsystems courses, providing technicians with the opportunity to graduate with two certifications in addition to an associate degree, which makes them more marketable. The new courses are increasing the capacity of community colleges to produce technicians for a wide variety of micro- and nano-technology related industries. An introductory microsystems course is being offered for dual credit in high schools to introduce high school students to microsystems concepts and careers. Students receive actual clean room experience each semester through field trips to either Norte Dame University or the University of Michigan, both located within a two and a half hour drive from the college.<br/><br/>Micro and nano-technologies are found in a wide range of products made by major employers in the state including Advanced Surface Microscopy, Bangs Laboratories, Delphi Corporation, Eli Lilly and Co, Guidant Corp, Exelis, J&S Resource Management, M4 Sciences, Makuta Technics, MicroTechNano, MonoSo, Prosolla, QuadraSpec, Semafore Pharmaceuticals, and Sensor Advanced Development. Although the integrated circuits (IC) industry saw a two percent decline overall in 2012,  the research by Yole Development showed that the microsystems sector grew by 10 percent to become an $11B business. Analysts expect a 12-13 percent compound annual growth rate through 2018 to create a $22.5B microsystems market. The use of microsystems and integrated circuits is crucial to the design and development of new products. Common examples include accelerometers, pressure transducers, inertial sensors, micro fluidic pumps and flow sensors. The introduction of microsystems technology via the proposed course modules and kits, and those already developed by SCME, provides a unique opportunity for students to learn engineering concepts in an easy to see fashion while exposing them to design and fabrication techniques which are currently being used in many microsystems industries.<br/><br/>"

An initial planning meeting was held in September 2009 to assess the need for and interest in such a consortium. That meeting indicated there was a need for such a consortium in the Midwest. Some of the goals that came from that meeting include the desire to hold workshops and business meetings, the desire to look at how best to partner with industry and high schools, the need for clear career paths in bioscience for the diverse Midwest region, and the need for a location for students to present their work. The project is developing additional partnerships with other colleges and their industrial partners, as well as state and local life sciences groups. In addition, the goals and objectives of a Midwest region consortium are being solidified. <br/><br/>INTELLECTUAL MERIT The main intellectual merit of this project is the opportunity to share knowledge that will come from a planned Midwest Region Consortium. In the Midwest, there are a diversity of program specialties, from biomanufacturing and lab skill programs to medical device and bioprocessing programs. With the development of regional partnerships comes the enhanced opportunity to share instructional materials, teaching skills and learning opportunities among the partners. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS There are two main outcomes of this grant: best practices for partnerships between educational institutions and industry partners, as well as a solidified plan for a Midwest Region consortium of biotechnology related community college educators together with their high school and industry partners. Partnerships such as these allow industry to influence the education of their future workforce, thereby having better-educated new employees. Educators are better able to meet the needs of their communities through strong partnerships with local industry. In addition, high school students and teachers may not be fully aware of the positions available, so that students may not be prepared for jobs in this growing industry. A center can address all of these needs."

It includes detailed expert instruction, video and audio feedback, and evaluation. The structured, modular format lends itself to degree programs as well as to employed workers who need specific training. A total of 60 modules are expected to support over 2,000 learners each year. Each component takes students through a complete, progressive learning system that first teaches through simulation, and then allows interaction through real-time remote lab operation. AutomationTek draws on the partners' strong relationships with industry, experience in distance education, established articulated degree programs, emphasis on active learning and innovative instructional technology, and reputations for individualized, quality instruction. Modules that respond to workforce development, yet emphasize comprehensive education grounded in theory, develop learners who can process information, solve problems, and are ideally suited to current and future manufacturing environments. A focus on two-year programs improves access for many underrepresented learners who choose to enroll closer to home. With remote operation of equipment becoming more common in the workplace, successful remote operation of equipment for education and training supports Indiana's commitment to continued manufacturing growth and has long range potential for global impact.<br/><br/><br/>"
