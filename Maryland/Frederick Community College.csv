Frederick Community College, located in Frederick, MD has approximately 4,400 students.  The college intends to connect through IISNET, the County government's Interagency Information System Network which serves as their local Internet service provider.  The campus needs the Internet connection to be able to access information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world.  The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of this institution as well as the community in general.  The award provides partial support of the project for two years."

Throughout its 5 years, this project will fund 30 scholarships in 3 groups of 10 students who are pursuing associate's degrees in STEM disciplines. The program will offer these scholars the resources and support needed to identify appropriate STEM-related academic and career pathways and make a full-time commitment to achieving their goals related to their chosen pathways. The project will answer the need to train more students to become STEM professionals.  With financial support, faculty mentoring, exposure to research, industry experiences, and opportunities for STEM-related community service, students will develop an identity not only as STEM students, but as professionals entering a discipline and members of a robust STEM community.<br/><br/>This project will seek to provide new understandings of how to improve student enrollment and success (retention, completion, and/or transfer) using STEM scholarship funds and student interventions. The research in the project will build upon and extend prior studies around increasing STEM enrollment using scholarships and interdisciplinary seminars, retention models for STEM majors, and best practices for student intervention identified by Complete College America.  Along with these activities, a speaker series, field trips, service learning opportunities, and other co-curricular events will be created by the STEM Scholars program to aid in the creation of a cohort identity. Through interviews and surveys, the program plans to determine which parts of the program attracted students, how and why these components affected them academically and socially, and how these experiences made lasting changes to their future success.  It will also examine the impact of the scholarships covering the entire cost of attendance on students' employment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The scholarships are for traditional age college students from public and private county high schools. The targeted students are being identified with the help of high school guidance counselors and teachers. The program seeks to identify minority populations, especially women and persons with disabilities, who meet the scholarship eligibility requirements. The specific program goals include recruiting graduating high school seniors to attend the college with a declared major in computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, or mathematics; identifying and recruiting female or disabled students; providing a summer institute and job shadowing for incoming scholarship recipients; developing new joint ventures between the public schools and the college; increasing the number of county residents with skills to meet high tech needs of business and industry, and developing a comprehensive assessment plan to evaluate the effectiveness of planned activities."
