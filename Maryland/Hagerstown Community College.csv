Business, industry, and government need well-prepared technicians who can prevent, detect, and investigate cybersecurity breaches, and the growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have appropriate, specific knowledge and skills. In this project, the investigators will enhance the cybersecurity curriculum at Hagerstown Community College (HCC), offer more opportunities for students to engage in hands-on learning, and recruit more students (especially women and minorities) into the program. In particular, the college will launch an innovative partnership with the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute to offer extended research opportunities to community college students in cybersecurity. These students will gain hands-on training in the context of real research problems and will work with graduate students and faculty at the university. Topics to be emphasized in both the research experiences and the related curricular changes include cloud computing and mobile-device security.<br/><br/>Four goals guide the project: 1) Create new and updated curricula that optimize the use of NetLab and address emerging needs in cybersecurity; 2) Develop and offer new mentorship and technician-level research opportunities, producing a model for other associate degree programs; 3) Ensure that HCC graduates enter the workforce or transfer to four-year institutions, increasing the diversity of the regional and national cybersecurity workforce; and 4) Build upon and develop sustainability strategies. Towards the first goal, the investigators will develop new courses in ""Security in the Cloud"" and ""Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Security,"" provide professional development for instructional staff to complete VCA-Cloud and VCP-Cloud training through VMWare, mentor students as they create new BYOD security policies and procedures, and put into place a new cybersecurity course as part of the Summer Bridge program for secondary school students and teachers (which enables students to make a smooth transition from high school to the college). To reach goal two, the project will incorporate research experiences into the new courses described above, provide research opportunities for students in partnership with the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute, and create a detailed ""lessons learned"" guide for community colleges that want to implement similar initiatives with university partners. To achieve the third goal, the research team will create new training scenarios (using the existing penetration testing lab) that enable the assessment of cybersecurity skills, strive to increase the number of women and minorities enrolled in cybersecurity and information systems courses by 50%, and add at least five new internship sites for students. Finally, towards the fourth goal, the investigators will build relationships with new business and industry partners and increase the use of the penetration testing lab for research, coursework, contests, and activities with those business/industry partners. The project will study factors such as students' performance in and satisfaction with the new and revised courses; the effects of the research experiences on students' persistence in cybersecurity; enrollment and completion rates in courses and the program; the mapping of the new training scenarios to defined cybersecurity Knowledge Units; the number of students placed in internships; the growth and engagement of business/industry partners; and utilization of the penetration testing lab by individuals and organizations outside the college. Findings are expected to broaden the knowledge base regarding the effectiveness of expanding access to research environments for community college students and the circumstances under which such access translates into increased learning and workforce development opportunities for the students."

Many of the youths in this area lack the confidence to envision paths for themselves outside of lower-skill jobs with which they are familiar. In addition, many are aware of the negative stereotypes associated with rural and/or Appalachian communities in which they live, and research has shown that awareness of stereotypes such as these impact students' ability to envision themselves on a particular path in addition to impacting their performance. The western Maryland region served by Hagerstown Community College (HCC) has a strong tradition of manufacturing excellence that has been threatened by the shift from ""old world"" to ""new world"" manufacturing jobs, with ""new world"" jobs requiring more technical skills, as well as the ability to perform root cause analysis. In order to address these needs, HCC is developing a new advanced manufacturing technology degree program, an industrial technology certificate program, and a basic electronics certificate program. These programs include new courses regarding circuits, schematics, and test equipment; lean manufacturing; and principles of quality assurance and teamwork, as well as revised curriculum to address high-technology manufacturing topics. <br/><br/>HCC is also offering educational events for local schools and regional partners.  HCC's project includes increased opportunities for women and underrepresented minorities through an emphasis on girls in College for Kids classes and a goal to enroll 33% women/minority students. In addition, Summer Institute activities will target early college students, and HCC has set a goal that 50% of these students are to be first-generation college students and 25% will be low-income. HCC is served by the Appalachian Regional Commission, and the project also fits with the Appalachian region's goal to end its distinction as one of the most impoverished and least-educated areas of the nation."

The partnerships are collaborating to address the need in the high growth biotechnology and biomanufacturing industries for technicians and scientists with problem-solving, mathematics, and critical thinking abilities, specific technical skills, and experience using state-of-the-art equipment. The core of the project is an articulated 9-14 curriculum that is all-inclusive, with multiple entry points. At the high-school level, resources are being targeted to first-generation college-bound, minority, and low income students from four Washington County high schools. At the college level, certificate and AAS degree programs in Biotechnology are providing academic and technical skills to students matriculating at varying levels of preparation and motivation, including high school students taking college courses before graduation. Development of articulation agreements with post-secondary partners (Frostburg State University, Hood College, Mount St. Mary's University, and the University of Maryland School of Medicine) is preparing for seamless transfers of biotechnology students to enter baccalaureate-level programs. The project incorporates assessment and remediation of math skills at the high school and college levels, increased development of math skills by providing real-life examples of the applications of mathematics in biotechnology, alignment and integration of these mathematics applications in all biotechnology coursework, and state-of-the-art bioscience instrumentation and materials for new laboratory facilities. The project also incorporates secondary teacher professional development and an orientation program for guidance counselors, and provides on-campus employer internship sites in addition to external internship opportunities for students."

HCC coordinates efforts through the PI and two division chairs to ensure that scholarships are awarded equitably and efficiently, while still involving program coordinators and lead faculty members in scholarship decisions.<br/><br/>Project objectives include raising S-STEM full-time enrollment rates by 30% and increasing retention rates for S-STEM students (compared to students in S-STEM-eligible majors in the past) by 20%.  HCC also seeks to improve completion/transfer rates and the percentage of full-time STEM degree program students who are members of minority groups or female.  Ambitious targets specify high rates at which S-STEM graduates will either find employment in a field related to S-STEM or enroll at a four-year institution within one year of graduation.  In order to ensure that HCC achieves its goals, the college is implementing ""intrusive"" S-STEM-specific advising, an S-STEM one-credit seminar required for all awardees, and additional activities such as an STEM club, field trips, and an S-STEM scholar recognition ceremony.  HCC works to increase the number of internship sites and four-year articulation agreements available to S-STEM students; the project also provides a limited number of scholarships for students who have graduated from HCC and have transferred to a four-year college or university.<br/> <br/>HCC's project is intellectually meritorious because it examines the effects of supports such as scholarships and academic supports on student enrollment, retention, completion, and success.  The project evaluation plan is designed not just to measure whether activities occur, but also whether they are effective.  HCC is also surveying students to determine how they learned about the S-STEM program and to identify which supports are most crucial to their success.  <br/><br/>The greatest impact of this project is expected to be demonstrated through projected increases in enrollment, retention, and completion rates of students, particularly underrepresented students, in STEM programs in HCC's Appalachian service area. Data indicate that a very low percentage of adults (~15%) in the region have bachelor's degrees, compared to 35.7% for Maryland as a whole and 28.6% in the nation.  Therefore, the project is particularly crucial for achieving local, regional, and national goals of assisting more students to complete degrees and transfer to further baccalaureate studies and/or immediately join the workforce."

Activities include the establishment of a new A.A.S. degree (designed specifically for those who wish to enter the workforce immediately), a new A.S. degree (a more computer science-based associate degree for transfer students), and a new certificate program (designed for those who just need basic certifications to enter the cybersecurity field), as well as outreach to local high schools. These features enable students, including high school students taking college courses before graduation, to follow a smooth educational pathway into jobs, certification examinations, or baccalaureate programs for additional education. The project is also developing a penetration testing lab to enable extensive hands-on training, providing professional development for teachers, making connections with cybersecurity start-up firms, and offering curricula for students who have completed degrees in fields other than cybersecurity but want to start new careers as cybersecurity technicians.<br/><br/>The career pathway for the cybersecurity/information assurance program is based on the model developed by the College and Career Transitions Initiative (CCTI). As defined by CCTI, a ""career pathway"" is an articulated sequence of rigorous academic and career courses, beginning in the ninth grade and leading to an associate degree, and/or an industry-recognized certificate or licensure, and/or a baccalaureate degree and beyond. Following this model, specific long-term outcomes for the project include (1) increased enrollment and persistence in postsecondary education; (2) increased academic and skill achievement at postsecondary levels; (3) increased attainment of postsecondary degrees, certificates, or other recognized credentials (including professional credentials needed by incumbent cybersecurity employees that go beyond traditional associate degree-related curricula); and (4) increased entry into stable employment or further education.<br/><br/>The project's new curricula are being offered in hybrid/online formats with flexible scheduling. This flexibility, along with the variety of program possibilities, enables the college to attract more prepared students into the cybersecurity/information assurance pathway and gives students who have completed postsecondary studies new opportunities to obtain additional professional credentials and move into the cybersecurity field."
