The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitations (NSF-05566).<br/><br/>Partners<br/>Howard Community College (Lead Institution), The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics, Laboratory, Goddard Space Flight Center, Naval Research Lab, Howard County Economic Development Authority, Howard County Public School System, and the regions business community.<br/><br/>The primary objective of the proposal follows. The Technology Assessment Program (TAP) is a comprehensive strategy to expand the innovation infrastructure of the Baltimore-Washington corridor and to speed technology transfer from the national research enterprise to the private sector. TAP will enhance entrepreneurial education through a continuum of coursework and teamwork; teach high school and college students the fundamentals of innovation and technology assessment; and facilitate access to technologies by entrepreneurs. The objectives are to (1) prepare students and prospective entrepreneurs to work in the innovation enterprise through a structured program of classroom presentations, mentoring, discussions with inventors, and practicums in completing product assessments; (2) offer USG-funded research labs access to additional resources for evaluating more technologies, assessing markets, and defining potential for licensing and/or new company development; (3) promote technology transfer in the region by offering entrepreneurs enhanced access to USG-funded innovations that have potential for licensing and/or business development; (4) enhance dissemination of entrepreneurial education, opportunities, and resources to non-traditional audiences through outreach activities, partnerships, technology showcases, and other activities; and (5) create a replicable model of workforce development that facilitates communication and partnerships among high school students, community college students, graduate students, federal labs, inventors, and entrepreneurs.<br/><br/>Potential Economic Impact<br/>The state of Maryland ranks second nationally in federal obligations for R&D, yet thousands of inventions sit on the shelves of federally funded research labs for lack of resources to assess and market promising technologies. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project follows. It lies in the innovative partnering of promising high school and community college students with researchers, entrepreneurs, and technology transfer experts to produce market assessments of USG-funded inventions. It also offers nascent entrepreneurs access to the technology transfer process through an intensive hands-on experience. Research labs will have access to additional resources at minimal cost to assess and either develop or retire inventions that may otherwise remain on the shelves for lack of time, effort and money.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the activity follow. The community college and its partners will develop an experiential course on technology transfer as part of the Entrepreneur Studies degree program. Participating USG-funded labs will identify and summarize undeveloped technologies that warrant a market analysis. Under the guidance and instruction of inventors, entrepreneurs, and mentors, teams of high school and community college students will select a technology, perform market research, and analyze potential for commercialization. Students will present their findings and recommendations at a public event attended by business owners, entrepreneurs, researchers, technology transfer experts, and venture capitalists. Tech transfer staff will then work with entrepreneurs and business owners to pursue appropriate options and licensing agreements. Thus the Technology Assessment Program has the potential to serve as a model of entrepreneurial workforce development and technology assessment that may be replicable by other research facilities and education partners."

"1820903","Collaborative Research: Institutional and Community Transformation for Teaching and Learning Quantitative Reasoning in the Biological Sciences","DUE","Advanced Tech Education Prog","10/01/2018","08/21/2018","Patricia Turner","MD","Howard Community College","Standard Grant","Ellen Carpenter","09/30/2023","$250,000.00","","pturner@howardcc.edu","10901 LITTLE PATUXENT PKW","COLUMBIA","MD","210444311","4435184742","EHR","7412","8209, 9178","$0.00","Quantitative reasoning (QR) involves the use of mathematical skills, such as algebra and statistical analysis, to understand and interpret data.  The field of biology has become increasingly reliant on the use of quantitative reasoning to interpret large datasets, such as those gathered in genomic analysis and population studies.  This project is designed to improve quantitative reasoning skills in students at community colleges preparing to transfer into biology majors at four-year institutions.  These students are often underprepared to successfully complete biology majors and to continue to graduate education or to enter the STEM workforce.  To achieve long-term gains in students' abilities to apply QR in biological contexts, this proposal seeks to leverage a university/community college partnership to expand and deepen the QR content in core biology courses across the major.  The program aspires to provide a model for how consortia of community colleges and universities can facilitate course awareness and alignment to improve student gains in QR.  This project will test the hypothesis that this type of collaboration enhances pedagogy and transfer student success at four-year institutions.  Further, repeated interaction with QR modules within the core biology curricula are hypothesized to positively impact the success of all students in upper-level coursework.  These efforts are designed to strengthen the course performance measures of all students, including both direct entry and transfer students.  Improving student success and retention in STEM majors such as biology supports the goal of improving access of all students to scientific and technical careers.<br/><br/>The focus of the project will be on enhancing the QR skills of undergraduates through the creation of active learning modules focused on quantitative skill development, verified with validated assessment instruments.  Three scholarly communities will be established: 1) a Curricular Alignment Team, which will review curricula in four core courses (Introductory Biology: Cells and Molecules, Introductory Biology: Ecology and Evolution, Genetics, and Cell Biology) at the community colleges and the four-year institution in the collaboration, and identify areas for action, with emphasis on the development of QR abilities in biology majors; 2) the NEXUS Institute in Quantitative Biology, which will involve teams of faculty from each institution developing, piloting, and assessing QR modules for the core biology curricula and assessing the impact on student performance and retention; and 3) a Faculty Development Community, which will involve a series of shared faculty development workshops on evidence-based teaching approaches, to include the use of the created QR modules, and a common teaching certificate program.  These three communities will come together annually at a regional symposium, where the consortium products (QR modules) and findings (student assessment data) will be disseminated.  Taken together, this work will shape intra- and inter-institutional perspectives and practices relating to the importance of QR in the success of undergraduate biology majors.  By developing faculty collaborations through the scholarly communities described above, this project will provide training in modern pedagogical methods and module development for biology faculty at community colleges and four-year institutions.  The project will map the processes involved and disseminate the project findings widely to ensure that it serves as a model for other institutions that wish to take this approach to improve transfer student success and better prepare all biology majors for the modern STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
