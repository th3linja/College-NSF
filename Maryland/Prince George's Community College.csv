SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the southeastern United States. It will provide operations management and information services and it will give Prince George's Community College a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. By linking to the mid-level and national networks, Prince George's Community College faculty and academics will maintain a position of leadership in research and educational innovation by profiting from remote access to super computer centers, data bases and information services, high speed communications, file transfer and remote login, and access to library resources. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative educational resources."

Dr. Zdravkovich has initiated collaborations                    among four of Maryland's community colleges, with the                           purpose of forming a network of science faculty members                         interested in improving pre-college science education.                          Eleven faculty members from Cecil Community College, Anne                       Arundel Community College, and Hagerstown Junior College                        will attend workshops together to become familiar with                          exemplary instructional materials and approaches to                             elementary science education.

Interdisciplinary faculty teams will design problem sets that deal with statistics, the mathematics of finance, probability, and linear algebra. These problem sets will require students to identify and access data sets, frequently using the Internet as a resource, and then to analyze these real-world data sets using computer technology. The capstone projects at the end of the semester will require student teams to access data sets from broad disciplinary areas, determine the questions that can be answered from the data, and then to analyze it mathematically. An advisory board that includes faculty from other two- and four-year institutions, as well as external resource consultants, will provide guidance for this project."

Young Scholars will gain hands-on experience with IR, NMR, UV-visible spectophotometers, refractometer and gas chromatographies. Field trips to Litton-Amecom, NIH and the county policy laboratory will give students an opportunity to observe the increasing sophistication of modern instrumentation--from routine laboratory instrumentation to the highly sophisticated FTIR, mass-gas chromatograph interface, high resolution NMR and a one-of-a-kind microplasma detector. The institute, field trips and follow-up activities will expose Young Scholars to the breadth and wealth of science careers. Prince George's Community College's excellent science faculty and laboratories have lead to the development of special science projects targeted to different populations. These programs, enthusiastically endured by participants, county science supervisors, and the Maryland State Department of Education, answer the nationally and locally recognized need for upgrading content knowledge, generating interest and excitement in science topics and introducing science career opportunities."

Business, industry, and government need well-prepared technicians who can prevent, detect, and investigate cybersecurity breaches, and the growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have appropriate, specific knowledge and skills. As an Advanced Technological Education (ATE) center, CyberWatch has been addressing this workforce need for over a decade. In 2005, it was launched as an ATE regional center, with a focus on colleges and employers in the Washington-Baltimore region; and in 2012, it evolved into an ATE national center. The National CyberWatch Center (NCC) has achieved major national impact in cybersecurity education by establishing and validating education and training standards; creating a new annual conference focusing on cybersecurity education at the community college level; validating cybersecurity skills using performance-based assessments; and building new cybersecurity curricula tied to job roles and industry certifications.<br/><br/>In its next phase, the center will expand and enhance its leadership role by developing and promoting (1) programs and services designed to attract diverse populations into cybersecurity education and careers; (2) skills-based curricula; (3) collaborations among industry, government, and academia; (4) education, training, and assessment standards; and (5) other resources that increase the number of faculty members and colleges capable of offering high-quality courses and curricula in cybersecurity across the nation. One new focus will be to study and support students' transitions from two-year to four-year institutions in cybersecurity in order to increase the number of community college students who enroll in and complete CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service (SFS) programs."

A study is determining the effectiveness of each of the elements of the projects and is providing feedback to improve the process.<br/><br/>STEM students are invited to join a vibrant, holistic and nurturing Collegian Center where they become part of a cohort of STEM scholars. Students participating in the center are demonstrating an ""Evidence of Competency"" by participating in activities such as completing a capstone course and presenting their work at an annual institutional student conference, leading a ""Build Your Own Computer"" weekend activity, engaging in summer research internships and/or completing a community based service-learning project. The scholars are being provided with a number of services that include mentoring, mentor training, and field trips to transfer institutions and industry to explore career opportunities. They are being rewarded with scholarships for academic achievement and are serving as role models to encourage other students to pursue a STEM degree program. <br/><br/>The project is increasing the number of students who succeed in college level pre-calculus courses through Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL), a model adapted from City College of New York that was developed for chemistry through NSF funding.

An emphasis is being placed on the investigation and interpretation of graphical patterns and mathematical relationships within the general chemistry laboratory program. The project provides for the development of new experiments dealing with gas laws, spectrophotometry, thermochemistry, and electrochemistry that utilize the newly acquired computer systems. In addition, all general chemistry students work in teams to design a team experiment using the new equipment.
