Skilled engineering technicians are a critical part of the nation's high-tech workforce. Engineering technician positions frequently require Associates Degrees in areas such as mechanical, electrical, electronics, or civil engineering. In this project, the Community College of Baltimore County will conduct a pilot in cooperation with Baltimore County Public Schools (BCPS) that will improve the ability of high school students to enter careers as engineering technicians.  Supplemental materials will be added to a series of existing high school technology education courses that, when taken in combination, will allow a high school student to receive articulated credit for the college-level ""Introduction to Engineering Technology"" course offered at the Community College of Baltimore County.  In this way, by pursuing a series of high school advanced technology education courses, high school students will start earning credit towards an Associates Degree in an engineering technology field.  This program will also offer training for high school teachers, training for elementary, middle and high school counselors, and outreach to high school students. The project will help to broaden participation in engineering technology careers by creating a more seamless and efficient pathway from high school into technician jobs requiring an Associates Degree.<br/><br/>The project will utilize the existing Engineering by Design (EbD) curriculum developed by the International Technology and Engineering Education Association (ITEEA). This curriculum is used by many secondary schools throughout the United States and meets relevant STEM standards in many states. In Maryland, the EbD Foundations of Technology course is required for all ninth grade students.  After taking Foundations of Technology, high school students may elect to continue the EdD curriculum and enroll in the advanced technology education courses called Advanced Design Applications (ADA) and Engineering Design (ED). The ADA and ED courses are already taught in many schools.  This project will enable other community colleges and school districts to develop a set of supplemental materials for the existing ADA and ED courses that will enable high school student taking the required Foundations of Technology course and the two elective advanced technology education courses to receive credit for the first college course in the Associates Degree in Engineering Technology at the community college.  Since the ITEEA Engineering by Design curriculum is widely used throughout the state of Maryland and across the country, the potential exists to expand this approach statewide and across the nation.  The project team will begin to develop collaborations outside of Maryland to propagate this model to other states.<br/><br/>The project also includes other activities integral to achieving the goal of broadening participation in engineering technology careers. A training program for school counselors is being developed to better able them to encourage students, especially those from underrepresented groups, to enroll in this series of technology courses with the goal of continuing education beyond high school.  A professional development program will be developed for high school teachers concerning effective use of the supplementary materials.  An outreach program, involving engineering technology students from the community colleges called Student Ambassadors, will be implemented.  <br/><br/>The evaluation of this project will yield data concerning the potential of using a high school technology curriculum aligned with a college-level engineering technology program to increase the number and diversity of high school students pursuing two or four-year degrees in engineering technology.  Evaluation will provide a baseline assessment of skills and content needs for high school teachers who will teach the new articulated technology classes.  Measurements will be made of teacher learning, satisfaction, and confidence related to teacher professional development activities. The annual number of teachers participating in professional development activities will be monitored along with demographic data. Annual benchmarks will track implementation of the new curriculum in participating schools: number of courses offered, number of students enrolled, as well as teacher self-reported developments.  Evaluation will consider assessments of high school student knowledge, interest, and attitudes toward engineering technology studies and careers in participating schools.  Measurements will be taken at baseline, during, and after the project.  Measurement of impacts will include the number of two-year/four-year articulations and transfer pathways at baseline, during, and after the project. The goal of increasing the number of students in engineering technology programs will be assessed through measurements of the number of college students enrolled in the engineering technology programs at the participating 2-year institutions who utilized the articulated credit at baseline, during, and after the project."

With the participation of private industry, trade associations, higher education, secondary education, government agencies, and assessment experts, the Center aims to inform and improve manufacturing education through discovery, utilization, and dissemination of intellectual resources such as the National Skill Standards Board, the Manufacturing Skill Standards Council, and the ATE centers. The Community College of Baltimore County (CCBC) will lead the effort, with assistance from College of Southern Maryland, Harford Community College, and Wor-Wic Community College. <br/><br/>The project objectives, activities and deliverables represent a comprehensive strategy to increase the number of manufacturing technicians to meet local workforce demands, and to improve the technical skills of those workers. The center will focus its energies in four program areas: <br/><br/>(1) Curriculum development and adaptation: To address Maryland's diverse manufacturing base, the partners are designing a modular, flexible program that can be reconfigured and adapted to address varied workforce education needs at the high school or college level. The model arranges thirteen industries into three primary segments: processing, fabrication, and electronics/instrumentation. The curriculum is structured around a cluster of core workplace skills as defined by the WorkKeys system (e.g., applied technology, teamwork, observation) and core technical skills (e.g., instrument calibration, industrial measurements, process control) identified by the project team as common to a majority of the industries.<br/><br/>(2) Skill assessment and workforce/program improvement: Employers are demanding reliable methods to assess critical technical and workplace skills of job applicants; educators seek similar skill measurements to ensure that their students are work-ready upon graduation. To that end, MCMEE is constructing an assessment methodology grounded in the strong positive correlation between the newly-created curricula and on-the-job performance expectations of local employers. With those new instruments, the Center can assess the skills of current and future manufacturing workers. Assessment data is being compiled, aggregated, analyzed, and reported to educators and employers for use in quality improvement efforts.<br/><br/>(3) Enhanced recruitment to manufacturing careers: A two-pronged approach to change the negative image of manufacturing jobs targets both educators and students. Faculty and career counselors from both high schools and colleges are participating in on-line technical courses, tours and presentations at manufacturing facilities, attending workshops and national conference, and participating in internships at local companies. Innovative efforts to attract students to manufacturing include new experiences at the Baltimore Museum of Industry and intensive summer workshops for high school students. <br/><br/>(4) Electronic communication and integration of services: A web-based portal is a central resource for accessing services and information related to manufacturing, including skills-based career exploration and job matching; a job exchange for on-line job postings and applications; promotion of education and training opportunities; linkages among faculty, employers, service providers, and other audiences; and on-line dissemination of project and assessment information."

The field of biology has become increasingly reliant on the use of quantitative reasoning to interpret large datasets, such as those gathered in genomic analysis and population studies.  This project is designed to improve quantitative reasoning skills in students at community colleges preparing to transfer into biology majors at four-year institutions.  These students are often underprepared to successfully complete biology majors and to continue to graduate education or to enter the STEM workforce.  To achieve long-term gains in students' abilities to apply QR in biological contexts, this proposal seeks to leverage a university/community college partnership to expand and deepen the QR content in core biology courses across the major.  The program aspires to provide a model for how consortia of community colleges and universities can facilitate course awareness and alignment to improve student gains in QR.  This project will test the hypothesis that this type of collaboration enhances pedagogy and transfer student success at four-year institutions.  Further, repeated interaction with QR modules within the core biology curricula are hypothesized to positively impact the success of all students in upper-level coursework.  These efforts are designed to strengthen the course performance measures of all students, including both direct entry and transfer students.  Improving student success and retention in STEM majors such as biology supports the goal of improving access of all students to scientific and technical careers.<br/><br/>The focus of the project will be on enhancing the QR skills of undergraduates through the creation of active learning modules focused on quantitative skill development, verified with validated assessment instruments.  Three scholarly communities will be established: 1) a Curricular Alignment Team, which will review curricula in four core courses (Introductory Biology: Cells and Molecules, Introductory Biology: Ecology and Evolution, Genetics, and Cell Biology) at the community colleges and the four-year institution in the collaboration, and identify areas for action, with emphasis on the development of QR abilities in biology majors; 2) the NEXUS Institute in Quantitative Biology, which will involve teams of faculty from each institution developing, piloting, and assessing QR modules for the core biology curricula and assessing the impact on student performance and retention; and 3) a Faculty Development Community, which will involve a series of shared faculty development workshops on evidence-based teaching approaches, to include the use of the created QR modules, and a common teaching certificate program.  These three communities will come together annually at a regional symposium, where the consortium products (QR modules) and findings (student assessment data) will be disseminated.  Taken together, this work will shape intra- and inter-institutional perspectives and practices relating to the importance of QR in the success of undergraduate biology majors.  By developing faculty collaborations through the scholarly communities described above, this project will provide training in modern pedagogical methods and module development for biology faculty at community colleges and four-year institutions.  The project will map the processes involved and disseminate the project findings widely to ensure that it serves as a model for other institutions that wish to take this approach to improve transfer student success and better prepare all biology majors for the modern STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
