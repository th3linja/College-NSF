Faculty from Montgomery College's STEM divisions as well as the School of Education will work with Montgomery County Public Schools to support two strands of development: the first will include the recruitment and support of 39 STEM professionals as they transition into STEM teaching positions, the second will expand outreach to encourage undergraduate STEM majors to transfer to STEM teacher preparation programs at regional four-year institutions.  The alternative teacher preparation program for career changers involves intensive pre-service training and a teaching internship flowed by a year-long residency.  The project will integrate a variety of elements to address challenges faced by students enrolled in this rigorous course of study, including (a) orientation materials that address the time commitment, (b) increased assessment and feedback to students designed to bolster their self-efficacy and personal confidence, and (c) assignment to field placements with peer partners. <br/><br/>The key aspects of the project are designed to respond to an analysis of barriers for transfer students' enrollment in STEM majors after leaving Montgomery College and the retention of career changers in their alternative teacher preparation program, which was supported by a Noyce Capacity Building award.   For community college transfers, a comprehensive plan has been designed to align coursework between Montgomery College and regional 4-year institutions; a strategy meant to strengthen the pool of STEM majors who will be attracted to teaching.  For the scholarship recipients (career changers) everything from the selection process, during which applicants will be pre-screened using results of the Haberman Star Teacher Pre-Screener Assessment to determine if their mindsets are compatible with teaching in high-needs schools, to the training activities are designed to graduate STEM teachers who are both confident and resilient.  Formative and summative evaluation will include the results of assessment of the surveys of program participants, internship supervisors, and mentor teachers and principals as well as teacher performance during the resident year.  Surveys and interviews will also be used to assess self-efficacy of the participants and to identify their best-perceived supports.  Program activities and outcomes will be disseminated through the meetings of the National Association of Community College Teacher Education Programs and the National Center for Education Information, among others.  Manuscripts will be submitted to the Journal of STEM Education and the Journal of the National Association for Alternative Certification."

The field of biology has become increasingly reliant on the use of quantitative reasoning to interpret large datasets, such as those gathered in genomic analysis and population studies.  This project is designed to improve quantitative reasoning skills in students at community colleges preparing to transfer into biology majors at four-year institutions.  These students are often underprepared to successfully complete biology majors and to continue to graduate education or to enter the STEM workforce.  To achieve long-term gains in students' abilities to apply QR in biological contexts, this proposal seeks to leverage a university/community college partnership to expand and deepen the QR content in core biology courses across the major.  The program aspires to provide a model for how consortia of community colleges and universities can facilitate course awareness and alignment to improve student gains in QR.  This project will test the hypothesis that this type of collaboration enhances pedagogy and transfer student success at four-year institutions.  Further, repeated interaction with QR modules within the core biology curricula are hypothesized to positively impact the success of all students in upper-level coursework.  These efforts are designed to strengthen the course performance measures of all students, including both direct entry and transfer students.  Improving student success and retention in STEM majors such as biology supports the goal of improving access of all students to scientific and technical careers.<br/><br/>The focus of the project will be on enhancing the QR skills of undergraduates through the creation of active learning modules focused on quantitative skill development, verified with validated assessment instruments.  Three scholarly communities will be established: 1) a Curricular Alignment Team, which will review curricula in four core courses (Introductory Biology: Cells and Molecules, Introductory Biology: Ecology and Evolution, Genetics, and Cell Biology) at the community colleges and the four-year institution in the collaboration, and identify areas for action, with emphasis on the development of QR abilities in biology majors; 2) the NEXUS Institute in Quantitative Biology, which will involve teams of faculty from each institution developing, piloting, and assessing QR modules for the core biology curricula and assessing the impact on student performance and retention; and 3) a Faculty Development Community, which will involve a series of shared faculty development workshops on evidence-based teaching approaches, to include the use of the created QR modules, and a common teaching certificate program.  These three communities will come together annually at a regional symposium, where the consortium products (QR modules) and findings (student assessment data) will be disseminated.  Taken together, this work will shape intra- and inter-institutional perspectives and practices relating to the importance of QR in the success of undergraduate biology majors.  By developing faculty collaborations through the scholarly communities described above, this project will provide training in modern pedagogical methods and module development for biology faculty at community colleges and four-year institutions.  The project will map the processes involved and disseminate the project findings widely to ensure that it serves as a model for other institutions that wish to take this approach to improve transfer student success and better prepare all biology majors for the modern STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The quarks and gluons give rise to a finite size of the proton, which is about 10,000 times smaller than the size of a single atom. The goal of this project is to measure the size of the proton.  An on-going puzzle is that the proton size appears to be different when measured with atomic hydrogen as compared with its counterpart, called muonic-hydrogen, where the electron in a hydrogen atom is replaced by its heavier cousin, the muon. This project will specifically build equipment to be used in an experiment to provide an independent measurement of the proton radius. In addition to the direct scientific goals of the project, the experiments provide students and young scientists experience and training in working in the international collaborations of modern scientific experiments, with state of the art technology.<br/><br/>The seven standard deviation discrepancy between the proton radius measured with muonic hydrogen and with electron-proton scattering may point to physics beyond the standard model of particle physics, or result from novel aspects of conventional physics or from issues in extracting the radius from experimental data. The Muon Scattering Experiment (MUSE) aims to resolve the proton radius puzzle. MUSE uses a mixed pion, muon and electron beam at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland. MUSE will determine the proton radius through both muon-proton scattering and electron-proton scattering, in addition to performing these reactions with positive and negative leptons. This not only reduces systematic uncertainties but also provides sensitivity to two-photon exchange contributions that may be responsible for some of the discrepancies seen in earlier experiments. This collaborative project supports the construction of MUSE over the period September 2016 - August 2018. There will also be ongoing testing and commissioning activities at PSI, including a dress rehearsal run with a partial spectrometer in late 2017.

The site will serve as both an archive and a dissemination tool, including a course-building interface for faculty. Instructors will be supported in creating innovative and individualized courses, mixing and matching from multiple sources tuned to their needs, offering a flexible and low-cost alternative to traditional textbooks.  <br/><br/>Many of the objectives and features of the project are innovative.  Hence, the project also includes research components of four critical and interacting elements: IPLS content, IPLS pedagogy, the organizational structure of the site, including tagging and taxonomy of all elements for appropriate selection to meet the needs of individual users, and the user interface. Three overlapping research teams will carry out this work: the User-Centered Design team, the Instructional Content Design team, and the Community-Building and Professional-Development team. This project focuses on engaging and expanding three communities: (1) physics and biology education researchers, (2) IPLS contributors, and (3) IPLS adopters wanting to use and adapt existing IPLS materials.  Merging and expanding the efforts of these communities will occur through a combination of workshops, online support communities, and research to advance the understanding of faculty professional development for IPLS education. The IPLS-Portal infrastructure, once developed, could be used to provide a community-sourcing environment for other STEM disciplines."

In July 1996 a one-week workshop will explore Visual Thinking in Chaotic Dynamics and in July 1997 a one-week workshop will explore Visual Thinking in Fractal Geometry. A pair of day-long follow-up seminars will take place during the academic year following each workshop. The primary goals of MUMEP II are: 1) to present new visual mathematical topics to faculty from institutions in the region and to use graphics calculators and computer graphics to enhance understanding of the new visual mathematical topics; 2) to relate the new visual mathematics topics to existing undergraduate mathematics courses wherever reasonable; 3) to promote communication and collaboration among faculty in the area's institutions. In addition, special teacher preparation activities are planned to engage faculty who teach significant numbers of pre- service teachers. In particular, the project's recruiting efforts will look for opportunities to involve such faculty, and workshop activities will showcase lessons that can be incorporated in mathematics classes taken by prospective teachers and in school mathematics classes as well. All materials prepared for or during a workshop or seminar will be disseminated during the session or shortly thereafter. Under the guidance of members of an Advisory Board, evaluation of the program will be facilitated through daily and summary questionnaires."
