This is a multi-focused project involving program improvements and technical experiences that targets students at both the secondary and postsecondary levels. Efforts to serve those currently underrepresented, women and minorities, are being emphasized. A recruitment plan that raises awareness and enthusiasm for the field is being implemented, and innovative project-based learning activities are being integrated into program requirements in order to improve retention. Modules developed through the New York State Curriculum for Advanced Technological Education (NYSCATE) project are being adapted for local programs. Student portfolios are being used to monitor progress and document their readiness for employment. Employers are hosting onsite Tech Days, participating in annual Technology Fairs and participating in the evaluation of students' portfolios. Employer feedback is being analyzed regarding changes in the readiness of local graduates for entry-level employment. Project results are being shared through presentations and professional contacts since they are transferable to other communities where school systems and postsecondary institutions share workforce development responsibilities. Statewide dissemination of the project results is assured through the Maryland State Department of Education and the Maryland Association of Community Colleges."

Business, industry, and government need well-prepared technicians who can prevent, detect, and investigate cybersecurity breaches, and the growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have appropriate, specific knowledge and skills. The demand for educated and talented cybersecurity personnel exceeds the supply in Southern Maryland, which is home to multiple naval bases, several Fortune 500 companies, and a growing list of smaller entrepreneurial enterprises. This project will contribute to growing the region's cybersecurity workforce talent pipeline and to increasing its diversity. In particular, it will develop cybersecurity professionals who are also knowledgeable in business and management.<br/><br/>The project will implement practices shown by research to be effective, contributing to the understanding of curricular and co-curricular activities that affect recruitment, retention, student success, academic and career pathways, and degree attainment in cybersecurity. The project will introduce an updated cybersecurity curriculum that is closely aligned with the unique cybersecurity workforce needs of industry and military base partners in Southern Maryland. The curricular modifications are also aligned with continuing the college's designation as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense - 2-Year Education (CAE-2Y). Activities will include:<br/>* developing a new business area of concentration in Cybersecurity Policy, with stackable certificates and the opportunity for students to earn professional cybersecurity certifications;<br/>* summer orientation events;<br/>* boot camp workshops to prepare students for certification exams;<br/>* monthly cohort activities, such as guest speakers, field trips, hackathons, and career enrichment;<br/>* cybersecurity career awareness workshops for K-12 teachers, parents, and students;<br/>* a virtual learning community that will bring together students attending classes on different campuses;<br/>* engaging industry partners in the design of courses and curricula;<br/>* integrating real-life cybersecurity enrichment activities into the cybersecurity program to increase student satisfaction and improve retention; and<br/>* increasing the number of women, minorities, and first-generation college students entering cybersecurity careers.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, which focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to award a total of 96 scholarships to at least 52 academically talented STEM students with financial need. The project plans to implement and study practices shown by research to be effective.  In this way, the project will contribute to understanding about recruitment, retention, student success, academic/career pathways, transfer, and degree attainment in STEM fields. The project aims to: 1) implement undergraduate research experiences in the community college and studying whether these experiences increase student satisfaction with the program and retention; 2) measure students' perspectives about persistence, and its relationship to campus climate and students? sense of belonging; and 3) contribute to the growing body of knowledge about community college students' experiences and success in STEM fields.<br/><br/>In addition to scholarships, the project will provide students with a continuum of support services aimed at increasing retention and assisting graduates in transitioning to further education or employment at one of the regions? private sector companies, military installations, and government agencies. Targeted programs include Applied Sciences and Technology, Biological Technology, Computer Information Systems, Computer Science, Engineering, Engineering Technology, Information Services Technology, Information Systems, Cybersecurity, and Mathematics and Physical Sciences. Project objectives include: 1) increasing enrollment by capitalizing on extensive K-16 STEM activity in the region; 2) improving student registration through advising and program pathways to encourage retention; 3) increasing student retention through community-building, biweekly cohort contact, mentoring, tutoring, undergraduate research, a summer bridge program, and enrichment experiences; 4) expanding and streamlining articulation to facilitate transfer to four-year institutions; and 5) engaging employers in recruiting, mentoring, and providing work-based enrichment experiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By providing scholarships and a continuum of support services the project seeks to increase retention and assist graduates in transitioning to further education or employment at one of the private sector companies, military installations, and government agencies in the region. Targeted programs include Applied Sciences and Technology, Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Computer Information Systems, Computer Science, Engineering, Engineering Technology, Environmental Technology, Information Services Technology, Information Systems Security, and Mathematics and Physical Sciences. <br/><br/>Project objectives include:  <br/>(a) increasing enrollments by capitalizing on extensive K-16 STEM activity in the region;<br/>(b) increasing student retention through community building, weekly cohort contact, mentoring, tutoring, and enrichment experiences;  <br/>(c) expanding and streamlining articulation to facilitate transfer to four-year institutions; and engaging employers in recruiting, mentoring, and <br/>(d) providing work-based enrichment experiences for students.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project is introducing a customized, one-credit College Success Skills course as the vehicle for shaping students from diverse STEM disciplines who attend programs on three different campuses into small learning communities. The approach uses lessons learned from improving retention and academic performance by student athletes. By bringing students together over four semesters, offering them shared enrichment experiences, and providing mentors from both academia and the employment communities, the initiative is demonstrating a replicable approach for increasing success within STEM populations.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project is increasing the number of academically talented, financially needy students, many of whom are first-generation college-goers, who have the opportunity for advanced careers. In an institution where females comprise 63% of the student body, and nearly half the full-time science majors are minorities, significant numbers of participants are expected to be from groups typically underrepresented in STEM careers. Outcomes for varied student population groups are being tracked and disseminated via the project website, presentations, and/or scholarly articles."
