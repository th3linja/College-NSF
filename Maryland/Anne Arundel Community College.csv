SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the southeastern United  States.  It will provide operations management and information  services and it will give Anne Arundel Community College a 56 bits  per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million  bits per second) National Backbone network.    The college has experienced a growth in auxiliary programs that has  added value to the basic mission that the college serves to aid the  education of all persons of all ages.  The networking plan at Anne  Arundel Community College is the foundation for uniting all the  disciplines and campus groups."

The field of biology has become increasingly reliant on the use of quantitative reasoning to interpret large datasets, such as those gathered in genomic analysis and population studies.  This project is designed to improve quantitative reasoning skills in students at community colleges preparing to transfer into biology majors at four-year institutions.  These students are often underprepared to successfully complete biology majors and to continue to graduate education or to enter the STEM workforce.  To achieve long-term gains in students' abilities to apply QR in biological contexts, this proposal seeks to leverage a university/community college partnership to expand and deepen the QR content in core biology courses across the major.  The program aspires to provide a model for how consortia of community colleges and universities can facilitate course awareness and alignment to improve student gains in QR.  This project will test the hypothesis that this type of collaboration enhances pedagogy and transfer student success at four-year institutions.  Further, repeated interaction with QR modules within the core biology curricula are hypothesized to positively impact the success of all students in upper-level coursework.  These efforts are designed to strengthen the course performance measures of all students, including both direct entry and transfer students.  Improving student success and retention in STEM majors such as biology supports the goal of improving access of all students to scientific and technical careers.<br/><br/>The focus of the project will be on enhancing the QR skills of undergraduates through the creation of active learning modules focused on quantitative skill development, verified with validated assessment instruments.  Three scholarly communities will be established: 1) a Curricular Alignment Team, which will review curricula in four core courses (Introductory Biology: Cells and Molecules, Introductory Biology: Ecology and Evolution, Genetics, and Cell Biology) at the community colleges and the four-year institution in the collaboration, and identify areas for action, with emphasis on the development of QR abilities in biology majors; 2) the NEXUS Institute in Quantitative Biology, which will involve teams of faculty from each institution developing, piloting, and assessing QR modules for the core biology curricula and assessing the impact on student performance and retention; and 3) a Faculty Development Community, which will involve a series of shared faculty development workshops on evidence-based teaching approaches, to include the use of the created QR modules, and a common teaching certificate program.  These three communities will come together annually at a regional symposium, where the consortium products (QR modules) and findings (student assessment data) will be disseminated.  Taken together, this work will shape intra- and inter-institutional perspectives and practices relating to the importance of QR in the success of undergraduate biology majors.  By developing faculty collaborations through the scholarly communities described above, this project will provide training in modern pedagogical methods and module development for biology faculty at community colleges and four-year institutions.  The project will map the processes involved and disseminate the project findings widely to ensure that it serves as a model for other institutions that wish to take this approach to improve transfer student success and better prepare all biology majors for the modern STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will provide scholarships to at least 75 talented and financially needy students with at least 50% from underrepresented groups (minorities and women).  The project will increase the retention of ESP Scholars and enhance placement of graduating ESP students in the STEM workforce or enrollment in a four-year engineering degree program by improving student academic and support services.  The scholarship program supports the development of student intellectual capacity. It incorporates best practices for retention of underrepresented students and provides continuing opportunities for students to build a cohort and explore common academic and social interests throughout their college experience. The project team will study similarities and differences between ESP students and non-ESP students.  The broader impact of the project will be demonstrated by an increase in the number of students from underrepresented groups who major in engineering disciplines and receive associate degrees. Students will be supported by a diverse team of faculty, staff and industry representatives. The project will also demonstrate that stronger connections between two and four-year colleges will help diversify the pool of engineers."
