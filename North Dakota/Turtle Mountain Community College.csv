Business, industry, and government need well-prepared technicians who can prevent, detect, and investigate cybersecurity breaches, and the growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have the necessary knowledge and skills. To address this nationwide challenge in education and workforce development, this project will establish a cybersecurity program at a tribal college, building a seamless pathway for students to move from high school into an associate degree program in cybersecurity and on to a job or a related bachelor's degree program. The project's overarching goal is to increase the number of students, including Native Americans, veterans, and women, pursuing cybersecurity-focused degrees and technical certifications. The investigators aim to build a replicable model that can be adapted and scaled, especially at other tribal colleges.<br/><br/>This project at Turtle Mountain Community College will build on the college's Computer Support Specialist program, which provides two years of technical computer education leading to an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree. Students in the new cybersecurity program will learn skills in computer architecture, operating systems, computer troubleshooting and repair, server administration, network infrastructure design and support, network infrastructure security, and programming. The curriculum will incorporate a hands-on, experiential learning approach. Local employers have committed to provide on-the-job training, job shadowing, and part-time or full-time positions for students. Minot State University's Business Information Technology department will provide professional development for Turtle Mountain Community College faculty, will assist them with developing courses in different formats (on-campus, online, and hybrid), and will support a pathway for students who wish to transfer to the university after completing the two-year degree. The key activities in the project are (1) to develop a new AAS degree in cybersecurity/information assurance that is aligned with the needs of local business and industry; (2) to recruit high school students on or near the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation into the program through summer camps and other outreach; (3) to encourage students to obtain industry-recognized certifications to validate the skills they learn in the degree program; (4) to utilize connections within the Northern Information Technology Consortium (including Dakota College at Bottineau, Lake Region State College, Minot State University, and Williston State College) to extend the reach of the curriculum and support students who would like to transition to a related four-year degree program; and (5) to provide workshops, seminars, and other professional development activities to improve the cybersecurity knowledge and skills of Turtle Mountain Community College faculty.  This project will contribute to national priorities by strengthening cybersecurity education and increasing the diversity of the cybersecurity technical workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The TMFS brings together Native American college students, tribal community educators, rural secondary school teachers, rural secondary school computer technicians, and faculty, staff, and graduate students at UND. The TMFS provides a strong foundation for a geospatial technology program that will enhance science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines at TMCC and within secondary schools throughout north central North Dakota. This is being accomplished through the development of Geographic Information System (GIS), Global Positioning System (GPS) and remote sensing curricula for integration into TMCC's STEM discipline and other courses, including agriculture, forestry, life sciences, environmental public health, and Native American studies. TMFS is also providing summer internship opportunities for TMCC students to work with UND faculty and graduate students on research projects involving geospatial technology. In addition, a GIS certificate and an associate of science degree in geography are being developed for implementation at TMCC. Finally, the project is offering hands-on workshops for secondary school educators and computer technicians. Over two years, the TMFS project will directly impact 60 university and college faculty, staff, and students, as well as secondary school educators, in North Dakota. The TMFS is serving tribal and rural communities and providing an opportunity for TMCC students to learn about and to experience geospatial technology research methodology and applications in STEM disciplines. These students are better prepared to apply knowledge and technical skills gained to the challenges of economic development, land management, natural resource management, rural health services, and agriculture in tribal and rural areas. The tribal and other rural secondary teachers and computer technicians are developing professionally and have access to TMFS-developed curriculum that enhances STEM discipline experiences for tribal and other rural secondary school students."

The Turtle Mountain Community College is  serving as the fiscal agent for a coalition of 17 tribally  controlled colleges in a five-state region of the Upper Great  Plains that includes Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South  Dakota, and Wyoming.    The initiative has four major components: 1) Reservation  Initiatives, that will establish a process to increase the native  cultural knowledge and content into the science and mathematics  curriculum; 2) Technology Development, to promote the development  and use of technology as a teaching tool by establishing networks  across the region; 3) Partnership Development, to increase the  connections between RSI school and all interested stakeholders;  and 4) Commissioned Studies, a special initiative to support the  Reservation Initiatives component by providing teachers and  faculty members an opportunity to research and develop viable  teaching models for tying science and mathematics education to  culturally appropriate materials and methodologies for systemic  change.    The Reservation Initiatives component and the Commissioned  Studies are viewed as the ""seedbed"" to begin the process of  change at each of the 18 sites involved in the HPRSI (17  colleges, plus 1 reservation in Wyoming that is not served by a  college). It is important to acknowledge the differences among  these tribal communities, yet there are themes that provide a  common ground in their approach to educational reform, such as:  understanding the cultural behaviors in children and adults in  order to facilitate a higher level of learning; knowledge and  understanding of Native/indigenous knowledge in science,  mathematics and technology; acknowledging and utilizing the  wisdom and knowledge of native elders and other cultural  expertise to promote the integration of the cultural knowledge  base into a challenging science and mathematics.    The High Plains Rural Systemic Initiati ve will promote systemic  change in its five-state region by providing program  coordination, staff support, and program assessment that takes  into account both science, mathematics, and technology subject  matter and the cultural knowledge of the respective tribal group.    During the first year the HPRSI will sponsor six Reservation  Initiatives at the Sinte Gleska University, South Dakota, Dull  Knife College, Montana; Nebraska Indian College, Nebraska; Turtle  Mountain Community College, North Dakota; and the Wind River  Reservation in Wyoming.  The activities will improve curriculum  and instruction for science and mathematics in grades K-14 in  collaboration with comprehensive initiatives in the 5 states;  including the AMP program at Montana State University; the  Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota SSIs; and other reform  initiatives."
