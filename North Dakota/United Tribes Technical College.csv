Intensive and long-term staff development assures UTTC STEM faculty has access to adult learning principles, content knowledge and teaching practices as well as advanced degree/certification support. UT.NT4E faculty will work hand in hand with STEM students and general education instructors to provide enhanced STEM courses at UTTC. Peer teaching and mentoring are fundamental to this project. Emphasis on research affords the students ample opportunity to actively study issues important to them. The staff development and student support system ensures that UT.NT4E students successfully complete the Environmental Technology or other STEM degrees to either matriculate into a four-year degree programs or to enter the workforce highly-qualified to perform technician skills.<br/>The UT.NT4E program is evaluated using a multi-dimensional evaluation plan Based on the Phillip?s Model which uses data collected from eight categories to answer key questions regarding the overall accomplishments of the program and suggested strategies for improvements. The categories are student count, student satisfaction, student learning, American Indian Contemporary and Traditional values, experiential learning/internships, Impact on Indian Country, Return on Investment and Intangibles.<br/>UTTC is supported by five federally-recognized Tribes based in North Dakota and has a national reputation for excellence in education by Tribal colleges and universities (TCUs). UT.NT4E utilizes an advisory board composed of TCU administrators, faculty, regional environmental experts, and community members to assist in decision-making processes.<br/>Broad Impacts: This project will increase the numbe"

These are all relatively small and offer a complete  range of course selections including transfer curricula, para-  professional, and pre-engineering.    Each campus includes use of the state's On-line Dakota Information  Network and other library resources to improve student ability to  deal with information.  This is a particularly important task given  the isolation of Indian reservations and their need for  information.  The colleges will work with North Dakota's  sophisticated, higher education network to accomplish the  connection.  The North Dakota Information Network will provide  technical assistance and will provide the gateway service.

Participants will conduct environmental ecology research critical to Tribal lands in the Northern plains, under the guidance of mentors from UTTC (Bismarck, ND), Ft. Berthold Community College (New Town, ND), Sitting Bull College (Ft. Yates, ND), Oglala Lakota College (Kyle, SD), Augustana College (Sioux Falls, SD), and North Dakota State University (Fargo, ND). Participants will be involved in research focusing on restoration ecology, insect behavior and ecological impacts, integrated bison prairie management, effects of oil development of natural resources, conservation biology, and geospatial applications in ecological research. Undergraduates are recruited from across the Northern Plains, with a focus on tribal college students, and are selected based on expressed interest, demonstrated skills, and dedication to science careers. Participants will conduct individual research projects as part of a larger research team and will receive training in research ethics, project design, field and laboratory techniques, and analysis and presentation of results. Science teachers (grades 6-12) are recruited from reservation school systems and will conduct fieldwork alongside the REU participants. Teachers will develop curriculum modules based on their research experiences for their own classrooms and provide the modules to other teachers. Shared orientation week, a midpoint camping trip, and final presentations develop teamwork among the participants. Students will be encouraged to present at regional and national conferences and to publish their result in scientific journals. Participants are evaluated using the common assessment tool for biology REU programs. The program increases the recruitment, retention, and degree completion of Native American students in science, while providing a solid foundation for these students to be successful in graduate programs.

The TCU Enterprise Advancement Centers (TEA Centers) strand allows TCUP institutions to capitalize on their investments in STEM instructional and research capacity.  This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will have a direct impact on tribal communities in the areas of food, energy, and water resources.  UTTC is inherently intertribal and is uniquely positioned to serve many tribes through the development of an Intertribal Research and Resource Center (IRRC).  Moreover, given that these factors are amplified in the Northern Plains where natural and anthropogenic changes to the environmental, extreme and variable weather fluctuations, and stressed food systems are becoming more common and apparent, this work could serve as an international model for indigenous or rural communities. <br/><br/>The IRRC will expand UTTC's record of serving the Northern Plains as a research and training center and will operate on the four core activities of Research, Outreach, Training, and Education (ROTE). To meet the needs of our communities, the following goals will be met: 1) establish the Intertribal Research & Resource Center at UTTC, (2) develop the institutional and regional capacity for applying science to address community needs, and (3) enhance tribal natural resource and agricultural sustainability. The IRRC will be immediately transformative for the institution, allowing research faculty positions for the first time, a sustainable STEM research and outreach model, and a coordinated interdisciplinary approach to research, outreach, teaching, and education. The IRRC will conduct research and provide training and assistance to tribes in planning and managing multiple resources. A cohesive structure, strong institutional commitment, focus on communication and community resilience, and tiered oversight, including a full time center director will allow the IRRC to operate efficiently and effectively.  A focus on sustainability will enhance research productivity, collaborations, strategic planning, and partnerships.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

TCUP's funding of projects that address these goals expands opportunities for Native people to pursue challenging degrees and rewarding careers in STEM, to conduct research studies on culturally significant topics, and fosters generational appreciation for STEM education. In alignment with TCUP's goals, United Tribes Technical College has initiated a research study focusing on renewable energy production. The project will work to develop a more efficient method for reforming biogas into a renewable energy source that can be generated from organic waste materials. The production of renewable hydrogen offers many options for power generation, as well as potential conversion of hydrogen to renewable ammonia for use as fuel or fertilizer. Given the large number of farm and ranch operations in North Dakota and the Northern Plains states in general, the project is highly relevant and holds potential benefits for the region.<br/><br/>The project will examine reforming of methane to hydrogen and carbon dioxide via a combination of steam-methane reforming (water-based) and dry reforming (carbon dioxide-based). Additionally, water-gas shift activity will be designed into the catalysts. This ""mixed"" reforming presents several technical challenges which include coking of the catalyst, incomplete conversion of methane to hydrogen and carbon dioxide, and catalyst longevity. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop catalysts which optimize hydrogen production from a renewable resource (biogas or landfill gas) via development of catalysts which are rugged, robust, reliable, and economically advantageous in long-term operation of a renewable hydrogen production system. Additionally, the project will seek to develop catalysts which display long term activity at moderate operating pressures and temperatures, thereby enabling design of commercial/industrial systems which are affordable to construct and operate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
