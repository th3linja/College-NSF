By purchasing scientific and computing equipment, BSC will be able to integrate computer-interfaced equipment into its chemistry labs. This will allow BSC the following opportunities:    (1) To provide students with current technology by introducing guided inquiry-based labs that will include practical experience in computational data acquisition and analysis. (2) To prepare students with similar laboratory experiences as those conducted at four-year colleges and universities. (3) To improve the technical literacy of students entering the workforce. (4) To conduct a four-day workshop for approximately 20 area high school teachers. (5) To provide students with opportunities to design experiments that illustrate theory.    As a result of curriculum changes in general chemistry, organic, and biochemistry, about 800 students annually will be able to design experiments and manipulate variables allowing an opportunity to observe the relationships between theory and practice. In addition, they will be studying chemistry as practiced by professional chemists. This will help students compete more successfully when they transfer to four-year institutions or enter the workforce.  Approximately 20 high school science teachers will have an opportunity to experience these technologies by participating in BSC's summer workshops. These teachers will in turn influence at least 200 high school chemistry students each year.The academic achievements of this guided inquiry-based curriculum will be assessed. The results will be disseminated at conferences, through publications in professional journals and over the Internet.Assessment will include surveying students for their reactions to guided inquiry-based, computerinterfaced labs, and giving them the American Chemical S ociety's standardized test. High school teachers participating in BSC's summer workshops will complete evaluation forms. Faculty at transfer institutions and employers will also complete survey forms to assess students' level of success."

The framework for the project is linked to the strategic plan of the college.  Four partners from industry and state government are supporting the project by providing internships and cooperative education experience. The goals of the project are to: <br/>(a) Increase the number of students enrolling in STEM disciplines. <br/>(b) Increase educational opportunities for underrepresented students. <br/>(c) Utilize articulation relationships to promote seamless transfer for STEM students. <br/>(d) Strengthen internal collaboration within the college to support successful implementation of the project. <br/>(e) Enhance relationships with employers from STEM-related industries in order to increase the number of employees who are educated and skilled in ""technical areas of national need""; specifically within the following majors: Mathematics and Computer Technologies, Science and Engineering, Industrial Technology, Energy Technology, and Agriculture Technology and Natural Resources. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project advances knowledge and understanding through student learning in the STEM disciplines. Experience from a prior NSF CSEMS benefits the project. Enabling students to successfully participate in their education through a framework of comprehensive enrollment, teaching, learning, and support structures, the project promotes retention, builds a community of scholars, and assists students with workforce entry. Benchmark objectives for project outcomes include an increase in the five-year average rate of retention through individualized student action plans, a first semester seminar, and other student-focused strategies. The project is creating an active learning community of STEM students who persist in completing their education goals.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The intended impact of the project is to increase educational opportunities for students in STEM disciplines and begin to address the shortfall of workers critically needed in technical areas of national importance. The in-state demand from employers is significant due to the expanding economy leading STEM-related industries to hire graduates at placement rates approaching 100%. In addition, the project is broadening its impact by reaching minority students through a multicultural recruitment and retention plan."
