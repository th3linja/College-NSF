Programs in this cohort received planning support in<br/>the first year, with the subsequent two years used to implement systemic reform. As a<br/>result of this initial funding, 100% of the teachers at the target schools were trained and<br/>began to implement standards based curriculum in their classrooms. Strategies for Phase<br/>II were selected based on extensive research on high poverty schools that scored highly<br/>on standardized achievement measures. Effective reform efforts have been shown to<br/>provide professional development programs of high quality, be well coordinated with<br/>desired instructional outcomes results oriented, and have consistent policies throughout<br/>the system. Successful schools carefully assessed student performance in comparison<br/>with standards and created additional time for academic instruction. Based on this<br/>research, the C4 Initiative will expand on the following three fronts.<br/><br/>PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT<br/><br/>Standards Based Curriculum training offered twice<br/>per year will acquaint new hires and provide current developments for experienced<br/>teachers. Additional training sessions will focus on standards based assessment, including<br/>objective, standard alternative assessments to standardized tests. C4 will coordinate a<br/>Summer Science Institute during which teachers pilot lesson plans using independent and<br/>guided research in mathematics and science, and alternative assessment. With the<br/>coordination of C4 this curriculum will be piloted, evaluated and revised by the teachers<br/>involved in implementing it. This teacher-as-researcher model is anticipated to<br/>contribute to the scientific training of the workforce, and increase school commitment to<br/>the curriculum. An innovation in this area is the inclusion of a second strand of training<br/>for paraprofessionals, with a separate Summer Institute for teacher aides.<br/><br/>CONSISTENT POLICIES <br/><br/>The existing RSI Council of reservation programs aimed at<br/>improving SMET at the k through 14 level will be expanded to include Title I and RSI<br/>programs on other reservation. This committee will meet monthly to coordinate activities<br/>that will leverage resources, maximize teacher participation and have the optimal impact<br/>on student achievement. The Project Director will be appointed a member of the<br/>curriculum committee at each of the target schools. These committees are charged with<br/>adoption, implementation and publication of policies supporting standards based<br/>curriculum and other aspects of systemic reform. Extensive use of telecommunications<br/>will facilitate coordination with off-reservation programs.<br/><br/>COORDINATED RESOURCES<br/><br/>Examples of resource coordination outcomes are dual<br/>high school-college credit course to increase advanced opportunities in mathematics and<br/>science, and training at the state Indian Education Association conference supported<br/>jointly by all North Dakota reservation RSI projects. RSI staff and Council will<br/>coordinate the development of after-hours instruction in mathematics and science, funded<br/>by resources from private and federal grant funded programs already on the reservation.<br/>Training for these programs and policy development will be provided with RSI funds and<br/>by the RSI Council respectively.<br/><br/>Cankdeska Cikana can draw upon three years of successful collaboration with the school<br/>districts and an experienced RSI Project Director who is an enrolled tribal member and<br/>also a former middle school mathematics and science teacher. As such, the project begins<br/>with a high level of credibility with the target school administrators and teachers.<br/><br/>  <br/>"

Using a suite of activities and building on past successful work, Cankdeska Cikana Community College (CCCC) addresses TCUP's goals in the project titled ICE-TI II, with the ultimate goal of increasing the number of Native Americans graduating with STEM college degrees and entering the STEM workforce. The project provides new options in CCCC's mathematics instruction through the addition of the Carnegie Math Pathways system. Through collaborative work with other tribal colleges, the math curriculum is enhanced through the integration of community and student relevant content. Improvements in student support services (such as increased Internet access and tutoring) aimed at reducing common academic and non-academic barriers to Native students? college success are also key project activities. A participatory evaluation provides feedback that enables formative optimization of the project?s activities and outcomes. Findings from the evaluation will be disseminated in a range of forums to allow others, particularly those serving Native American students, to tap into the project's lessons learned.<br/><br/>The ICE-TI II project builds capacity in STEM instruction and research at CCCC through a comprehensive set of innovations in instruction and curriculum development. The project is designed to impact multiple system levels, including individuals, organizations, communities, and the broader society. Activities include increasing the use of problem-based learning and new educational resources, providing academic and non-academic services to ameliorate barriers to student engagement and retention, and supporting students' advancement from the two-year college experience through the transition to four-year colleges, graduate studies, and entrance into the workforce. Using Community-Based Participatory Action Research principles and employing a staggered, prospective multiple-cohort design, the project seeks to investigate questions about how best to support underprepared students? success in college. Since the Carnegie Math Pathways is a recently developed strategy, this project contributes to the emerging body of knowledge about the efficacy of CMP, especially for American Indian students and those living in rural areas. The project will inform future evaluations, as well, by assessing the psychometrics of instruments used to measure characteristics of American Indian students that may influence their academic success.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through strategic planning efforts, CCCC has carefully crafted a plan that will strengthen and sustain STEM courses and programs by:<br/>1. actively recruiting new talent (students and faculty) and raising the STEM bar by providing support to existing STEM curriculum through hiring highly qualified STEM faculty, research and development, and PEER tutoring;<br/>2. implementing an innovative mathematics curriculum paradigm that will approach mathematics from three alternative (Accelerated, Slice, and Extended) directions aside from the traditional 15 week model; and<br/>3. leveraging existing partnerships to provide a 4-year degree program through face-to-face, hybrid, and interactive video networking (IVN) course delivery.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: CCCC will achieve higher enrollment goals and retain students to matriculation into four-year institutions through recruitment and retention strategies that implement innovative tactics of math course advancement from 4 directions. Students will increase their ability to complete remedial and advanced mathematics through: 1) Accelerated Mathematics Academy (AMA); 2) use of mastery learning paradigm in extended math courses; 3) utilization of a Slice model for course engagement; and/or 4) continuation of the traditional 15 week semester approach. The college will increase STEM instructional capacity and improve research capabilities through the role modeling of a research environment that recognizes the importance of culture in relation to STEM. Additional STEM faculty with STEM credentials will enhance existing services and free up time for all faculty to focus on the development of intellectual and innovative models for learning. Evaluative processes will allow CCCC to build on existing pedagogical practices as well as cultivating new cutting edge practices.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: This project encompasses a comprehensive strategy to scaffold on existing education models that will implement a strategy for success through recruitment, support, and retention. A current student population averaging 245 students that are predominantly Native American of high poverty levels will be served. Opportunities for incoming freshman will increase college readiness with the AMA while attracting existing students that may have had disparities in the past. Successful implementation of this goal will help provide the paradigm necessary to promote a sustainable program and the backing to keep students on a path to successful matriculation into mainstream institutions. Additional STEM faculty expands the college's ability to explore proven models while increasing capacity to conduct research that will lead to dissemination through peer reviewed publications and conferences. The successful outcome of this project will increase STEM enrollment in mainstream universities. Broader outcomes focus on increasing STEM graduates that will serve as engineers, scientists, and mathematicians both inside and outside of Native American communities."
