Through this ATE project, NDSCS will increase the number of trained and certified welders possessing essential and advanced skills to meet the workforce needs of the region and state.  This project incorporates training modules developed through the ATE funded Regional Center for the National Center of Excellence in Welding Education and Training (Weld-Ed) and builds upon the success of NDSCS's North Dakota Advanced Manufacturing Skills Training Initiative (NDAMSTI) funded through the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training program of the U. S. Department of Labor.  The project will increase awareness among students from under-represented groups (females and minorities) of the opportunity of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) careers in welding.  NDwelds will significantly impact the regional economic environment by filling a critical employment training need.  This project responds to business and industry needs for welders by building the pipeline of students from secondary career and technical education programs to post-secondary welding programs.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project will be accomplished through the following five goals:  (1) Develop a welding curriculum at NDSCS by alignment with the curriculum delivered in career and technical education courses in secondary schools across North Dakota and the adoption of the American Welding Society's (AWS) Schools Excelling through National Skill Standards Education (SENSE) program, (2) Conduct outreach activities targeting female and minority students to increase enrollments in secondary career and technical education courses, (3) Recruit and train career and technical education instructors through professional development activities, (4) Facilitate the certification and testing of welders using national standards by NDSCS becoming an AWS Accredited Test Facility, and (5) Develop latticed curricula to establish new degree tracks in advanced skills for welding and manufacturing students at NDSCS while increasing the number of NDSCS graduates that participate in 2 plus 2 programs with Minnesota State University-Moorhead and Valley City State University.   These cumulative efforts of curriculum development, targeted outreach to diversify the student body, faculty professional development, and building sustainable pathways for welding and manufacturing have the potential to transform the regional and state landscape of welding technician education in North Dakota."

Upon completion of the STEM Scholars program, academically talented, but financially needy students, earn either an Associate of Science or Associate of Applied Science degree in a STEM field and are prepared to either enter the STEM workforce directly or transfer to university to pursue a baccalaureate degree. Including both pre-professional and career and technical programs (liberal arts programs with a focus in mathematics; chemistry, or engineering; Computer Information Systems programs; Machinist and Toolmaker Technology; and Civil Engineering and Surveying Technology) allow for a comprehensive approach to addressing these needs. <br/><br/>This project provides financial assistance to students through a scholarship program that includes three scholarship types. The standard scholarship provides financial assistance of up to $10,000 per year to students that have been fully accepted into the STEM Scholars program. Opportunity and Incentive scholarships, in the amount of $500, are designed to provide encouragement to students considering careers in a STEM field, but who do not meet all of the program entry requirements. These scholarships will be awarded for a single semester. If the student demonstrates that they can maintain at least a 3.0 GPA while in a participating STEM program, and while receiving the Opportunity and Incentive scholarships, they become standard scholarship recipients. Lastly, students compete for transfer scholarships upon completion of the STEM Scholars program. A transfer scholarship pool is being established with the intention of providing scholarships of $1,000 - $5,000 each to graduating students upon acceptance and entry into a STEM-related field at a university. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This project is increasing enrollment, retention, and graduation rates in STEM programs that directly address regional workforce needs. It is attracting more students, enabling them to study full-time, relieving financial concerns through significant financial assistance, forming an active learning community, supporting students with robust student services, offering new opportunities for industry and other professional interactions, encouraging and streamlining the transfer to university, and providing career counseling and job placement assistance. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: This project builds on efforts within North Dakota to encourage students to pursue and complete STEM degrees, and is designed to support them through to graduation and job placement. Special emphasis is being placed on recruiting students from underrepresented groups. The project benefits society by placing students into STEM careers; which are in demand and offer competitive wages and excellent opportunities for advancement."

The overall goal of the project is to increase the number of skilled, well-educated, and professional STEM graduates for the statewide and regional in-demand workforce by providing support for 60 STEM students who demonstrate academic talent and financial need. The program aims to unify students enrolled in career and technical STEM programs and liberal arts STEM transfer programs by incorporating experiential learning and integrating career-success skills throughout each student's plan of study. <br/><br/>The objectives of the Science of Success Program are to: (1) recruit academically talented STEM students with demonstrated financial need, (2) retain 100% of STEM Scholars from their first to second year of study and graduate 90% of STEM Scholars within two years, and (3) integrate career-success skills throughout their plan of study. Retention and graduation rates will be addressed by providing a support network of faculty and peer mentors, early intervention, academic tutoring, and by emphasizing experiential learning within and outside of the classroom. A Career Success Seminar Series will be designed using the 360 Career Success Skills learning modules to provide a platform for students to acquire career-ready skills and to network with industry professionals.  The research component of the project will determine the relationship of each intervention (retention, graduation, engagement, career readiness) to student achievement and professional skill development. The overall impact will be the natural formation of a community of practice that includes industry and four-year institution stakeholders, mentors, support team, alumni, and current students seeking to implement best practices to improve career success."

Remote access collaboration experiments and mini-projects are being developed for student teams who will not physically meet each other.  Students enrolled in introductory, general and organic chemistry, regardless of their location, directly operate the NMR to analyze their own samples.  An online teaching and learning community for the instructors involved in the project is being established to promote additional understanding of strategies to enhance student learning using remote access instrumentation networks. The intellectual merit includes development of new curricular materials and pedagogies to transform how small, remote colleges approach educating students, by providing authentic hands-on learning experiences, instead of relying on simulations and published materials.  The broader impacts of the proposal include improved  infrastructure for teaching and research at all five campuses through acquisition of the NMR. Multi-layered evaluation is being used to measure the impact on students' (a) content knowledge, laboratory skills and engagement, (b) ability to transfer and integrate knowledge between the laboratory and lecture courses, and (c) professional skills, such as critical thinking, communication, collaboration and professional behaviors.  Dissemination of the project's benefits and challenges provides a model for other small colleges to provide hands-on remote access to modern instrumentation."
