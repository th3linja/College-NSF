The project includes activities such as laboratory pilot-scale production of cellular extractions that enable students and faculty alike to engage in the process of discovery in agricultural biotechnology, a subdiscipline within the field that has national and global significance.  The RRBEC is improving the technical and pedagogical biotechnology skills of educators charged with teaching secondary and post-secondary students in southeastern North Carolina; enhancing the biotechnology curriculum for community college students; and increasing the number of technicians and researchers in the field of agricultural biotechnology.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:  This project improves a community college curriculum by adding both educational and training activities in agricultural biotechnology using adaptations from the NSF Bio-Link project.  Undergraduate students benefit from vocational biotechnology courses, as well as college transfer courses.  Industries offer direct input in the curriculum, and internship opportunities for students. Teachers benefit with hands-on workshops and classroom kits.  Faculty enhancement occurs through laboratory research, workshops and seminars. Most of the activities are organized through the establishment of an academy for students, teachers and faculty. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  Since the program serves more than 66% minorities and 80% first-generation college students, the RRBEC is increasing the numbers of underrepresented students in agricultural biotechnology vocational and college transfer curricula and among biotechnology technicians.  The project provides training and professional development of secondary school science teachers from the county and throughout the region, impacting hundreds of students each year.  The project adapts materials from Bio-Link, and is evaluated using quantitative and qualitative methods by an external evaluator."

Serving a student population composed of 45% Native American, 28% African American, and 24% White with 72% women and 28% men, the project is increasing the: <br/>1) number of students enrolled in mathematics and science/curriculum transfer programs; <br/>2) number of students receiving assistance from Student Support Services programs; <br/>3) retention of students to transfer or degree achievement; and, <br/>4) graduation rate of African American, Native American and female students in mathematics and science. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This project is developing the support network necessary for student achievement through a campus-wide effort. Academic performance is being supported through student learning communities, facilitated study sessions, one-on-one tutoring, faculty mentoring, counseling, and support through Student Support Services and electronic communities. Internships, job shadowing and/or faculty-led research opportunities are available to enhance learning and achievement. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The project impact is significant through incorporation of existing resources with newly developed activities to address the unique needs of rural, predominantly minority students. Research with trained professionals or introductions to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professionals in business and industry is advancing discovery and understanding and leading to greater achievement and degree attainment. Students are being prepared for successful transitions to work or baccalaureate degree programs, resulting in highly qualified candidates for jobs including jobs as public school science and mathematics teachers. Additionally, the opportunity to transfer scholarship funding to the university is a unique feature of the program. The project is establishing a model for achievement that can be replicated in many other disciplines."
