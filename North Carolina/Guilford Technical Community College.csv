The new observatory is designed to bring a modern, well-equipped, accessible observatory to the institution's students, as well as students from nearby colleges, high schools, and elementary schools, and the general public. Cooperative work is taking place between the astronomy and computer science staff to accomplish this objective.   The centerpiece of the program is an observatory with a 16"" telescope, which is to be equipped with a CCD camera, spectroscope, photometer, and auxiliary equipment.  Several smaller telescopes are also being purchased to be used for training purposes, along with two computers for image processing, data reduction, analysis, and storage."

The proposed work involves some exploratory analyses of conditions              fostering political movements generally and this movement in                    particular. The data under analysis consist of six exit polls taken             in Texas and California. Also to be undertaken are content analyses             of a growing collection of media materials about this movement and              additional interviews with its leadership. This proposed work will              significantly extend the author's previous work on language                     cleavage, interethnic group conflict and education in countries with            multi-lingual populations."
