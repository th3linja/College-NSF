Project activities will build a pathway from regional high schools to the CFCC chemical technology program, and will improve technician education at CFCC. Project activities include a high school science project competition supported by an instrumentation loan program. This activity builds on past NSF ATE-funded work at CFCC (Project W.A.T.E.R.S., Award# 1003564), and will be coordinated with local industrial partners. It will bring a technology and research-rich educational experience in the context of industry needs to high school students in their classrooms. CT-EnTICE will support a part-time chemical technology liaison to reach out to local business and industry to build new partnerships with industry in CFCC's service area.<br/><br/>CT-EnTICE will leverage what was learned during Project W.A.T.E.R.S. regarding positive community engagement and will incorporate industrial partners as active participants in its outreach activities. There is enthusiastic industry support for CT-EnTICE and the community science projects, and what is learned will improve technician education at CFCC. Anticipated outcomes of this project are stronger partnerships between the CFCC chemical technology program (which results in an Associates of Applied Science) and the community at multiple levels: students from high school, citizens from the community, and representatives from local industry. Ultimately, this project will increase the enrollment of the CFCC chemical technology program, expand the number of its community partners, and strengthen its relationships with industry. Many of the high schools targeted have a significant number of economically disadvantaged students, so heightened awareness of the CFCC chemical technology program through CT-EnTICE could lead these students to a pathway to economic prosperity. Project evaluation will measure participants' changes in opinions and perceptions of careers in chemical technology and their awareness of the program. The results will be disseminated through the ATE community."

They work in industrial facilities such as chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing plants, environmental laboratories, forensic chemistry labs, and the food and beverage industry. These technicians are typically trained in chemical technology programs.  Despite the essential roles of chemical technicians in the national workforce, many people are unaware of either the career possibilities in chemical technology or the chemical technology education programs across the nation.  This project plans to strengthen the Colleges? Associate of Applied Science in Chemical Technology program so that it is more visible and accessible to students, including students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM, veterans, and students with General Education Development credentials.  The project also intends to educate local employers, high school teachers, and high school students about the chemical technology field and its opportunities. To achieve these goals, the project plans to develop new partnerships and collaborations, prepare educational materials and approaches that explain the roles of chemical technicians in science and society, increase interest in Associate of Applied Science degrees, and clarify the need for more skilled technical workers.  Expected outcomes include an increase in STEM teacher awareness of the chemical technology field and educational pathways, a larger number of students who have experiences in the chemical technology laboratory and its career paths, and expanded hiring of graduates with Associate of Applied Science in Chemical Technology graduates.<br/><br/>This project aims to advance the recruitment efforts of the chemical technology program, to incorporate STEM teaching practices that maximize student learning in this advanced technology trade, and to educate the public about this high-demand advanced technology field.  Activities supported by the project will focus on serving potential students and career influencers, such as teachers, faculty, counselors, and administrators. Project activities include:  (1) implementing a summer STEM teacher academy to provide educators with experiences in chemical laboratory sciences and the career possibilities for chemical technology graduates; (2) hosting an annual high school student academy where students can use advanced analytical equipment and learn about the chemical technology profession; (3) establishing a new work-based learning agreement that will allow Cape Fear Community College?s Chemical Technology laboratory to serve as an on-boarding facility for employers, thus fast-tracking student employment after graduation; and (4) hiring a liaison who will focus on student recruitment, student retention, and employer awareness throughout the state of North Carolina.  These activities are expected to support the project plan of recruitment, enrollment, employment of students into the chemical technology workforce. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students are gaining hands-on training on the use and operation of a Purge & Trap Gas Chromatography system coupled with a mass spectrometer (GC/MS) and an ion chromatography (IC) system. <br/>Students are learning how to: follow standardized methods enforced by regulatory bodies such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), carry out multifaceted and advanced experiments, interpret chromatograms and mass spectra data, and operate computer-based instrumentation. Results from project W.A.T.E.R.S. are showing that fundamental changes within a science curriculum involving laboratory objectives coupled with appropriate discussions on theoretical concepts allows STEM students to clearly understand advances within the scientific field. Project W.A.T.E.R.S. is providing professional development opportunities to Cape Fear Community College faculty and local K-12 STEM educators. Underrepresented groups in the STEM community are benefiting through the introduction of new instrumentation that is allowing students to become more competitive in today's job market and/or to provide a better transition to a research-intensive university."
