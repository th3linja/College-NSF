For one week, these girls come to this campus to learn about automation, robotics, and engineering through a variety of group discussions, teachings, industry speakers, hands-on laboratory activities, and competitions. Camp participants take field trips to regional industries and a local university, emphasizing the cooperative roles for industry and education in advancing the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. Previous research shows a need to start recruiting women at an early age to enter into a typically male-dominated, non-traditional career. A marketing campaign, in collaboration with regional school systems, is being launched in order to increase female participation in these fields. A mentoring program developed during summer camp is continued throughout the school year among participants and mentors. The project enhances the partnerships among regional educational institutions and industry. It improves diversity in STEM-related fields by promoting and advancing the interests of girls and women in robotics, automation, and engineering. The results of the summer camp, as well as the results from the marketing campaign, are disseminated via workshops, conferences, publications, and websites to other community colleges, high schools, and middle schools."
