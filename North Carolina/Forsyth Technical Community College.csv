With the development of combination devices, sensors, photonics, and implantable systems, employers need technician-specialists who understand more than classical biological and chemical sciences and traditional engineering. The emerging technician-specialist will also need to understand fundamental principles of electronics engineering, mechanical engineering, nanotechnology, optics, photonics, and process-control/quality assurance. Through its National Center for the Biotechnology Workforce, Forsyth Technical Community College will lead the effort to define the skills and knowledge needed by these technician-specialists, and develop educational strategies that can help students learn those skills.  This project includes a collaboration between Forsythe Technical Community College (NC), Ivy Tech Community College (IN); Anoka-Ramsey Community College (MN); and College of the Canyons (CA). These four states account for 25% of the employment nationwide across all biosciences industry subsectors and 32% of jobs in medical devices and equipment. The project goal is to initiate, support, and nurture a national effort for advanced technological education that reflects the convergence of science and technology at the interface between biomedical devices and tissue engineering.<br/><br/>Skills for Biomedical Emerging Technology Applications (BETA Skills) will be defined in collaboration with multiple employers, industry groups, educators, workforce agencies, researchers, innovators, and other stakeholders, radiating outward from the four institutions. The project has two objectives: (1) Define BETA core skills for national use by educators, industry, researchers, and employers, and (2) Connect BETA core skills to educational and career pathways with multiple on- and off-ramps. The Biotech-Careers.org website will provide an online platform to curate national information about jobs and opportunities related to BETA core skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To meet the growing biotechnology workforce needs, the National Center for Biotechnology Workforce at Forsyth Technical Community College has been supporting nationwide education and training of technicians in biotechnology, bioprocessing, and related programs at community colleges. Biotechnology industries increasingly need workers with hands-on training in high-resolution mass spectrometry.   This project aims to expand the breadth and relevance of its support for biotechnology technician education by acquiring a high-resolution mass spectrometer. This state-of-the-art analytical tool can identify specific chemicals in a sample, even when the sample contains only a trillionth of a gram of that chemical.  Such information is used in industries ranging from environmental testing, and food and beverage production, to drug discovery and manufacturing.  The project proposes to use this spectrometer to train students and faculty in state-of-the art high-resolution mass spectrometry technology, thus aligning  technician education with emerging workforce needs.<br/><br/>The project has two goals.  First, it plans to acquire a high-resolution mass spectrometer and collaborate with industry partners to use real-world bioscience projects to provide students with skills-based instruction in how to use this technology.  Second, it plans to provide workshops that will help high school STEM educators increase their understanding of the bioscience industry, including the use of high-resolution mass spectrometry. These workshops are intended to provide teachers with the knowledge and skills they need to guide students into community college technician education programs that lead to bioscience careers. The College will partner with educators, employers, and entrepreneurs in and around Innovation Quarter in downtown Winston-Salem, NC, to develop instructional labs using high-resolution mass spectrometry on industry-related projects. Labs will include standard operating procedures on how to use the instrument to collect high-resolution mass spectrometry data, as well as how to interpret these data. This skills-based learning will serve faculty and students from the College and high school STEM programs, as well as those at other local universities. The workshops will also serve educators from across the nation who will be selected for their interest in and potential to develop advanced skills training that connects their local industry with the classroom. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these technicians receive their education from two-year technical schools and community colleges which offer associate degrees in a wide variety of engineering-technology areas. Prospective employers desire technicians who are well versed not only in their chosen specialty but also in other important skills. Among these skills are problem solving, the ability to work in teams, the ability to communicate ideas both orally and in written form and the ability to use modern data gathering and analysis tools.    The FTCC Technical Physics Project seeks to create an environment where technical students learn physics concepts and develop other desirable technical skills as well. A number of flexible modules will be developed which use activity-centered learning techniques to teach the physics concepts and problem-based learning to teach and foster these other desirable skills. Each module will introduce or build skill in the use of modern data gathering and analysis tools, lead students to solve ""real world"" problems in working teams, provide the opportunity for students to discuss the problems and solutions within their teams as well as with other students in the class and in other classes (via the internet) and write formal technical reports based on their findings. It is believed that this total immersion technique will lead to increased retention and understanding of the physics concepts and a high degree of success in the workplace.  The modules themselves will be developed by teams of faculty representing physics engineering technologies, mathematics and English and representatives from industry advisory boards. They will be field tested at two-year colleges in North Carolina, South Carolina and Michigan."
