Five courses (Bio 110, Bio 111, Bio 112, Bio 130, Bio 150) are directly affected and project resources are being utilized in other classes as well (chemistry, forensic chemistry, microbiology). A number of broader impacts are anticipated as this project serves a unique population of students and should help prepare them for jobs in the area or to enter a four-year college well prepared to complete their studies. The average age of students entering this college is thirty and a majority are attending college for job related retraining. Seventy-three percent (73%) are first generation college students and 77% qualify for need-based financial assistance. Experiments are designed to address two key concepts: 1) the impact of biotechnology on society and 2) the importance of monitoring environmental conditions in order to utilize them as resources without damaging the quality of those resources."
