Today's construction industry is a high tech landscape that plays a significant role in human health, resource management, and energy consumption. Modern buildings contain complex systems that require skilled technicians to properly design, install, and verify using technical skills along with scientific and mathematical theory and knowledge. This trend in the construction industry has led to industry demand for individuals with enhanced education and credentials to ensure buildings meet performance criteria. Informed by their industrial partners, CCCC will provide internships and field experiences that prepare students to earn relevant third party credentials that prepare them for the workforce. <br/><br/>This project will directly benefit three groups; students, CCCC, and local industry.  For student technicians, they will receive (1) a value added educational experience with both institutional and third party credentialing, (2) multiple avenues for success through educational pathways and stackable credentialing, and (3) increased field experience.  CCCC will (1) update curricula to better educate students interested in energy analysis and performance verification, (2) strengthen connections between the college and local industry, and (3) address technical education needs of underrepresented populations in the college's service area. The benefit of this approach to industry will be (1) the increased pool of well-trained new employees, and (2) the increased ease of hiring new employees with college credit training and industry specific, nationally recognized credentials."

A total of 52 scholars will be provided with scholarships that will cover their cost of attending school.  This project will draw upon a collection of student support practices with strong backing from the scholarly literature.  STEM faculty will collaborate with campus partners to sustain a comprehensive learning community that will provide support for scholars as they work towards graduation.<br/><br/>The comprehensive and intensive student services component of the STEP-UP project will be compared with traditional advisor/success coach models by tracking student retention and graduation outcomes, resulting in the collection of quantitative and qualitative data on best practices in student support for both traditional and underrepresented student populations.  This data will make it possible to measure the effect of scholarships and student support services on student participation, progress and success, in both the overall student population and the traditionally underrepresented local Hispanic/Latino population.  Analysis of specific programmatic components, and overall program satisfaction will generate new knowledge regarding student impact, program impact, and institutional impact."
