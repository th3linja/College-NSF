Through curricular revision, the creation of a new Mechanical Engineering Technology Center, and collaboration with industry partners an integrated approach to the manufacturing process is achieved. The Center's projects and the MET Cluster's courses adapt computer numeric control conversational programming applications and 3-D modeling modules developed by the Virginia Highlands Community College and the Piedmont Virginia Community College to enhance the Cluster's holistic approach to education and learning.<br/><br/>Existing partnerships with secondary school systems, local manufacturing industries, and James Madison University are being used to develop and implement innovative learning methodologies. Faculty are adapting the team oriented approach which has been successfully used by the College of Integrated Science and Technology at James Madison University. The college's partnerships with industry and the regional tech-prep consortium are resulting in the design of real world manufacturing projects to engage high school and college students in mathematics, design, and engineering courses. <br/><br/>The project enables Blue Ridge Community College to achieve improved integration of manufacturing technology throughout the mechanical engineering technology cluster, to provide faculty with increased opportunities to remain abreast of technological changes in manufacturing, and to demonstrate to the powe"

The major                 contribution of this project is the analysis and operation of control           systems and the associated advantage of providing hands-on experience           with equipment that provides an opportunity to apply many of the                engineering principles learned in the classroom.
