The project serves primarily minority and underprivileged college students from the Upper Coastal Plain Region of northeastern North Carolina, providing these individuals with an unprecedented science exposure. Computer-interfaced environmental science experimentation provides opportunities to make precise measurements of chemical and physical processes relevant to environmental changes (e.g., climate, air and water quality, water and soil pH, optimal plant growing conditions, etc.). This project also provides capabilities for monitoring simultaneous experiments, storage and detailed analysis of data, experimental simulations, and student design of experiments. Finally, the revisions to the curriculum this project is making possible provide students with an exposure to science and to computer applications in science, enhancing their long-term ability to perform effectively in an advanced technological society. The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources."
