With sustained high academic performance, students are eligible for a second year of SEAS scholarship support. The SEAS program combines a rigorous classroom curriculum, a vibrant student learning community, and readily utilized student support services to improve student engagement, learning, persistence and opportunity for degree completion. Scholarship recipients are participating in a weekly seminar course each semester to facilitate cohort unity while also building a strong social support system, and scholars are provided with information on STEM research initiatives and careers through invited speaker presentations and career-related topics and discussions. <br/><br/>SEAS program participants are engaged in the Engineering and Science Connections Mentor Program, and they are paired with a local mentor in their chosen field of study. Students in the second year of their program are given the opportunity to apply for an $800 enhancement grant to support independent research projects and to lend support to them if attending a state or regional scientific conference. In order to promote a seamless transfer of STEM students from the community college to a four-year institution, Craven CC continues to pursue additional articulation and bi-lateral agreements with transfer institutions for STEM programs. The SEAS program is clearly impacting STEM education at Craven CC, while it also serves as a prototype to other programs nationally."
