"1532907","Dual Enrollment Technician Pathways and Careers in Electronics Engineering and Computer Integrated Machining","DUE","Advanced Tech Education Prog","12/15/2014","09/21/2015","Deborah Porto","NC","Johnston Community College","Standard Grant","Elizabeth Teles","11/30/2017","$144,287.00","","portod@bellsouth.net","P O BOX 2350","Smithfield","NC","275772350","9192092571","EHR","7412","1032, 9178, SMET","$0.00","This project is designed to recruit rural high school students into community college technician degree programs that are linked to manufacturing jobs in the region. The project activities include: 1) developing a new Electronics Engineering Technology dual-enrollment program, 2) creating awareness among high school and college counselors, teachers and faculty, parents and students on the content of and career potential for Electronics Engineering and Computer-Integrated Machining technicians, 3) providing activities including summer camps to increase the recruitment of female and male high school students to dual enrollment technology programs, and 4) educating high school and college counselors on technician careers through externships and return to industry programs. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project is improving student learning in engineering technician programs by building on a pilot dual enrollment technician program established in computer-integrated machining. It is adapting materials, methods, and marketing materials from ATE Centers in Florida, Connecticut, and South Carolina. To increase opportunities for students to work in high paying jobs in manufacturing, the project is focusing on groups that are currently underrepresented in the field, particularly females. There is strong institutional support and there are strong partnerships with the public school system, manufacturers, and the economic development community.<br/> <br/>Broader Impact: In order to meet the skills gap faced by regional manufacturers, the project is developing and strengthening a pipeline of skilled employees for area manufacturers that is not dependent on incumbent worker retraining. The creation of a close partnership between manufacturers, the community college and the high schools is providing a response to changing technology in manufacturing to ensure their long term profitability. The expansion of dual enrollment programs is affording students new career options not previously understood and doubling the pipeline by focusing on both females and males. Long term, the success of the project is enabling the development of additional technician dual enrollment programs and creating a model Career Academy for high school students that can be adapted by other rural communities."

For example, over the next eight years, Novo Nordisk plans to invest in a $1.8 billion production facility and to hire 800 employees, approximately 500 of whom will be maintenance and process technicians. In addition, Grifols plans to invest $375 million in production facility upgrades and plans to hire approximately 500 technicians. This project will help meet these workforce needs by blending concepts and skills of applied engineering and biotechnology into two existing Associate of Applied Science programs.  To this end, four new courses will be developed in close partnership with two biomanufacturing companies.  These courses will integrate applied engineering topics into the Bioprocess Technology AAS program and biotechnology topics into the Applied Engineering AAS program.  In addition, both AAS programs will be enhanced by the addition of certification in the industry-standard DeltaV distributed control system software.  At project conclusion, it is expected that the first cohort of approximately 15 students will have completed the biotechnology/applied engineering programs, completed internships, and be ready for work as biomanufacturing technicians.  Approximately 75% of all of North Carolina's biomanufacturing is located with one hour of the central Johnston Community College campus, making the College an ideal location for this project.  Thus, this project has the potential to directly contribute to the national need for a highly-trained advanced technical workforce.<br/><br/>The project will pursue three goals: 1) develop and implement a new curriculum that integrates biomanufacturing and applied engineering; 2) develop a multi-skilled talent pipeline from college to industry; and 3) provide hands-on education in a simulated drug manufacturing environment at the College's Workforce Development Center.  With support from two local biomanufacturing companies, this facility will be enhanced with additional automated machinery and an updated design to create learning environment that simulates drug production using DeltaV industry software to control equipment, similar to that of a modern biomanufacturing facility. Students on the Applied Engineering track will learn to troubleshoot and repair production equipment in these facilities, and students on the Bioprocessing Technology track will learn to manufacture life science products by monitoring conditions such as pH, temperature, and drug concentration during production. By practicing in this environment, students will gain better skills in mechanical and biological techniques. The project coordinator will provide students with career coaching, engage in outreach to high school students, and work with industries to develop internship opportunities that will ensure employment upon program completion.  By blending applied engineering and biomanufacturing, this project could provide a transferable model to better prepare students for skilled technical positions in modern biomanufacturing.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
