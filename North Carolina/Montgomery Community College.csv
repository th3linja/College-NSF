The TECH-Lane project is expanding the STEM student pipeline by recruiting and assisting motivated but underrepresented, at-risk 8th grade and early college high school students.  The project accelerates students from high school, through college and into the semiconductor/nanotechnology workplace.  Using partnerships between educational institutions (high school, 2-year and 4-year colleges) and regional high technology industries, TECH-Lane is creating curriculum focused on innovative and transformative instruction using project-based learning (PBL) and integration of career and technical education.  Replicable, accelerated early college high school courses in Electrical Technology, a one week summer STEM camp curriculum for 8th grade students and professional development workshops for high school STEM faculty in the design, delivery and incorporation of PBL are being developed.  The intellectual merit of the project lies in the focused impact on workforce preparation in an area of national importance. Technical early college high schools are being established across the U.S. to answer the nationwide need for a well-trained high technology workforce.  Project based learning models have been shown to be highly effective in replicating real-world workplace problems and teaching students to think critically and creatively to solve them.  TECH-Lane is aligning with these initiatives by providing accelerated pathways for students and PBL training for their high school STEM teachers.  The TECH-Lane curriculum, disseminated widely through a detailed monograph and a project website, allows the early college high school/community college community across the nation to duplicate this model and assist in filling the need for high-tech workers ready for the 21st century workplace. Dissemination efforts and the ability to replicate the proposed program are among the significant broader impacts."

A technician career pathway program is established in the eleventh and twelfth grades of a Career and Technical Education program that aligns with two years of community college coursework in Electrical Technology.  The technicians mainly work at the systems level and need skills in testing and measuring.  Most technician jobs involve installing new equipment and maintaining and servicing large expensive equipment.  The project develops thirty two-week modules for the 11th grade exploratory technology courses and thirty more for the 12th grade technician education courses by adapting materials from the ATE-funded Career Curriculum for Technology project.  The courses address standards-driven technological skills and 21st Century Skills and provide a strong foundation in STEM subject areas through exploration of current and emerging technological fields.  High school students in Career and technical education are encouraged to continue their education through being able to earn fifteen college credits in five STEM courses while earning seven high school credits in STEM subjects.  Eight new modules are developed for the Electrical Technology courses at the community college.  These courses provide instruction in key concepts through studying the component systems in consumer and industrial products.  The formative evaluation, done by an external evaluator, provides information on vertical alignment model, the curricular materials, and the creation of a student centered learning environment."
