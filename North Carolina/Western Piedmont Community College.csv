College algebra students and calculus students are required to have graphing calculators while other students are required to have scientific calculators with linear regression capability. The integration of computer usage into the mathematics curriculum is the next logical step in the evolution of the College's mathematics program. To achieve this goal, the Western Piedmont Community College Computer Enhanced Mathematics Instruction Project (CEMIP) will enable the department to equip a multipurpose instructional computer laboratory by providing matching funds for the purchase of 21 microcomputers, four printers, a VGA liquid display panel with-an overhead projector, and site licenses for three commercial software packages DERIVE, MAPLE, and MINITAB. The lab will be used as a teaching classroom, an assigned computer usage lab, and limited-access lab open for selected mathematics students. Initially, the project will concentrate on incorporating computer usage into calculus and statistics instruction, with the ultimate goal of having computer usage integrated into the entire mathematics curriculum."

The research and industry-standard laboratory equipment acquired with the NSF grant permitted the following objectives to the achieved: (1) the introduction of new gas chromatography exercises, (2) the introduction of new visible and infrared spectrophotometric exercises, (3) the teaching of computer assisted analytical skills for data acquisition and manipulation, and (4) the opportunity for students to acquire hands-on experience with sophisticated laboratory equipment. Important scientific concepts previously taught with audio-visual aids and visits to university and industry laboratories are now integrated into campus classroom and laboratory instruction. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds."

This is being accomplished by introduction of Workshop Physics and microcomputer-based laboratory curricula. Five Macintosh LC's provide the heart of the new physics lab, and a host of probes interfaced with the computers allows the students to gather and reduce data for further analysis. Students learn almost all of their physics from these labs, effectively eliminating lectures."
