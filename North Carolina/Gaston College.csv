Gaston College (GC) is a state-supported, open-door, comprehensive community college serving Gaston and Lincoln counties in North Carolina, and is a member of the 58 institution North Carolina Community College System (NCCCS). This program is intended for students preparing to transfer to a four-year institution for further study in any STEM discipline. This project enables the recruitment of larger numbers of STEM students and helps scholars address major barriers to completion through strong peer-support networks, and focused advising and mentoring.  Success of the scholars is fostered by financial support, academic cohorts, mentoring, and supplemental group activities. While this project targets all STEM students, based on the demographics of the college and surrounding community, the project has a positive impact on the numbers of underrepresented students enrolling in and completing STEM programs. <br/><br/>The Gaston College program uses high-impact strategies including cohort formation mentoring and meta-cognitive exercises to improve persistence and graduation rates for STEM students. The goals include (1) transformation of curricula through integration of inquiry-based instruction and development of a research methods course with an undergraduate research component as a capstone experience; (2) centralization of STEM student support services within a center environment to include advising, mentoring, cooperative work experiences and undergraduate research experiences, and tutoring; and (3) reduction of the unmet financial need of cohort students by providing scholarships.  As part of the evaluation process, quantitative assessment is collected for both for scholarship recipients and the general population seeking Associate of Science degrees. Data include GPA, course grades, retention rates, enrollment and rates of progress towards degree, percentage of underrepresented groups, graduation rates, and transfer and/or job placement rate."

This project aims to award 90 one-year scholarships over five years to 30 different STEM students; support will be available for up to two years at the community college, and up to two semesters after transfer to a four-year STEM degree program. The aims of the project are to improve retention, course success, degree attainment, and transfer success of students in the Gaston College Associate of Science and Associate of Engineering degree programs.  Community colleges are the entry point to higher education for many low income and demographic groups that are underrepresented in STEM careers.  Thus, by identifying practices that most effectively promote student success both at the community college and after transfer, this project can provide a model for community colleges and their university partners. <br/><br/>Using Tinto's model of academic and social integration as its theoretical basis, this program will implement activities that build students' academic cultural capital, maintain student interest in STEM, and increase student success in STEM majors, particularly for underrepresented populations.  These activities include academic supports in the form of learning community participation, professional tutoring, faculty mentoring, success coaching, and targeted advising, as well as co-curricular activities that support STEM identity formation. After transfer, cohort graduates will benefit academically and socially by maintaining contact with their original support networks via virtual mentoring and web-based discussion boards through which they can share experiences, find campus resources, and get advice and support, thereby reducing the effects of transfer shock. Many of the activities, such as participation in learning communities, have been shown to be effective in increasing retention and graduation among STEM majors. However, little research has been done to examine the impact that maintaining a connection to the original learning community has on transfer shock. This project aims to address this gap in current knowledge and continue to advance understanding of activities associated with community college student retention, transfer between institutions, and degree attainment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
"1501267","Promoting Technology Apprenticeship Consortia","DUE","S-STEM-Schlr Sci Tech Eng&Math, Advanced Tech Education Prog","09/01/2015","01/27/2017","George Hendricks","NC","Gaston College","Standard Grant","Elizabeth Teles","08/31/2017","$197,910.00","Diane Metcalfe, Dennis McElhoe","hendricks.george@gaston.edu","201 Highway 321 South","Dallas","NC","280349565","7049226511","EHR","1536, 7412","1032, 9178, SMET","$0.00","In recent years manufacturing and industry in the United States have changed remarkably. Low-skill, labor intensive jobs have moved overseas while processes have become highly technical and automated. Workers who lost jobs in manufacturing find they do not have the technical skills needed to qualify for new jobs in modern industry. High school graduates also will need additional technical education to compete for good jobs in the current economy. Apprenticeship, which was for centuries the primary method of technical training, is re-emerging in the United States as a means to meet the needs of modern industry. This project at Gaston College in North Carolina will build on a successful apprenticeship program created in partnership with a local industry and will provide a model for the creation and support of apprenticeship consortia in which industries partner with each other, the community college, the public school system, and local economic development agencies to provide highly skilled advanced technology workers. The knowledge obtained from the project will allow other colleges to adapt the model to the needs of their own local industries and will promote the creation of similar consortia. Through this program, students will work and receive specific on-the-job training while concurrently taking technical college courses related to their job. The company will pay the wages of the students and also pay for their tuition and books. Upon completion, students will receive an academic certificate from the college, will be certified as a Journeyworker in a U.S. Department of Labor recognized job title, and will have secure employment with the company. The company will have an employee whose education and training is tailored to their specific needs. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to promote the creation of local consortia of industries with similar needs. The primary advantage will be a pool of students that will allow the college to offer and schedule classes as well as purchase laboratory equipment that will meet the needs of employers. Each consortium will belong to the industry members; but the college will provides advice, support, and coordination for the academic portion of the program. This project will allow the college to create services and activities that will promote the formation and growth of apprenticeship consortia for Chemical Operators and Industrial Mechanics, the two college programs already in place. A Success Coach will provide assistance to apprentices in the academic portion of their program. A consultant will assist the companies with development and maintenance of apprenticeship programs and will facilitate communications between the companies and the college. Marketing materials will be created to promote advanced manufacturing and apprenticeships. Partners will include the industries in the consortia, Lincoln County and Gaston County Public Schools, the North Carolina Department of Commerce, which administers apprenticeship programs in the state, and Economic Development entities in both counties. A comprehensive evaluation will determine the components needed for these apprenticeship programs to succeed."

During the five-year award period, this project aims to fund 156 scholarships for students who are pursuing associate's or bachelor's degrees in the biological sciences. In addition to the scholarships, students will receive faculty and peer mentoring, have access to targeted advising, and participate in summer research opportunities. Each of the partner institutions will also redesign STEM courses in which students often struggle, so that the courses emphasize student-centered learning. Together, these efforts have the potential to increase the number of students graduating with a STEM degree from each partner institution, and prepare these graduates to enter the STEM workforce or pursue further study in STEM. <br/><br/>Limited studies of community college retention appear in the research literature.  Using Tinto's model of integration, this project focuses on several points of attrition that reduce students' academic and social integration into the biological sciences and contribute to reduced retention in STEM careers. At the community college level, academic supports will be critical for maintaining student interest in biology.  High impact supports include faculty mentoring/advising intended to increase successful transfer to the biology major at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, and co-curricular activities such as contact with faculty and peer mentors from UNCC. Once they have transferred to University of North Carolina, Charlotte, scholarship students will benefit academically from co-enrolling in sections of required courses, including organic chemistry and calculus, in which biology majors have historically struggled. To support their success, scholarship students in these courses will have access to peer mentors who have received training about how to address transfer student issues. Other activities include involvement in research opportunities, which has the potential to increase student integration into their campus and scientific communities. The impact of each program component will be investigated via a mixed methods design, to determine the component's impact on integration of transfer students into the UNCC community and degree completion. This research focuses on the interplay between socioeconomic status, gender, and institutional factors that limit or support integration into STEM communities and impact persistence in the biology major.  The results from this research will help to refine existing theories of student integration and contribute to a growing body of work on intersectionality in STEM. Dissemination of these findings may inform the creation of similar discipline-based learning communities for transfer students at UNCC and other public institutions of higher education with large transfer student populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
