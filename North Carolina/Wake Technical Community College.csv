The geoscience community is also struggling to diversify its workforce. Much research demonstrates that undergraduate geology students who are exposed to geoscience research early in their education are much more likely to pursue geoscience careers than their peers who did not have this exposure. Wake Technical Community College (Wake Tech) is addressing these issues by providing its diverse population of introductory geology students with paid summer geoscience research opportunities at partner institutions: North Carolina State University (NCSU) and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences (NCMNS).  Students who participate in the summer internships also are being integrated in an ongoing program of mentoring and professional socialization through multiple opportunities to present their research projects to various audiences, including at professional meetings, to other undergraduates, to high school students, and to the public.  The project is creating broader impacts beyond the immediate research experiences for students in the program, because of the potential of outreach by a more diverse group of students for attracting additional students from underrepresented groups as they consider their own choice of major.<br/><br/>Wake Tech, located in Raleigh, North Carolina, has a large and flourishing introductory geology program consisting of diverse freshman and sophomore students who are looking to transfer to four-year institutions. This project is working to: 1) increase the number of students, including those from groups underrepresented in geosciences, transferring from community college to geoscience programs at four-year colleges and universities; 2) provide three cohorts of 12 Wake Tech students with engaging, cutting-edge geoscience summer research internship experiences at partner institutions (NCSU and NCMNS); 3) demonstrate the effectiveness of early research experiences for community college students; and 4) engage more than 1300 Wake Tech geoscience students each year in a greater number of inquiry investigations based on current NCSU/NCMNS geoscience research. Students completing the summer research internship are also involved with promoting a better understanding of geoscience careers and issues among the broader population of Wake County through participation in the Wake Tech Student Chapter of the Association of Environmental and Engineering Geologists (AEG) and outreach to local high schools, Wake Tech students, and NCMNS visitors. The strong partnership between Wake Tech, NCSU, and the NCMNS ensures the highest quality of research experiences and mentoring with careful attention to mentoring students from their initial interest through acceptance in a four-year college geoscience program."

In North Carolina, rapid growth in emergent technology-intensive sectors is creating opportunities for skilled technicians, even as the State's traditional economic powerhouses of textiles, tobacco and agricultural continue their precipitous decline. A serious disconnect exists between the skill sets that satisfied the traditional industries and those required by new sectors. The Eastern North Carolina Plastics Technology Consortium was created to address these impediments as they affect the plastics industry. The three-year program is leveraging resources of multiple community colleges to educate students for careers as technicians in plastics manufacturing. Catalyzed by industry requests, the Consortium has secured State funding for facility construction and approval from the North Carolina Community College System to develop an AAS degree program in plastics technology. Students complete the first year of courses at their respective home institutions and a second year of technology-intensive, hands-on courses at a shared centrally-located facility. Goals include curricular reform based on industry standards, professional development for faculty including industrial experiences, and recruitment and retention of students using an innovative mentoring model that calls on faculty and industry partners. <br/>"

By involving plastics industry personnel and services, this project is also strengthening the partnerships of the consortium and helping to stimulate the depressed economy of the region. This project assists the Eastern North Carolina Plastics Technology Consortium, or ENCPTC (NSF grant DUE 0101468), in its efforts to provide well-trained plastics technicians.<br/><br/>To achieve the above goals, the specific objective of this project is to expand, refine, and refocus recruitment efforts to develop a target pool of 350 ""interested"" high school students; from which, 20% or 70 students are being selected to receive student support services, including financial assistance. This population of 70 economically disadvantaged or under-represented first year students are being provided student services and economic support in order to maintain an 80% retention rate for second year students. Ultimately, a 90% employment rate (in plastics technology) of all program completers will be achieved.<br/><br/>The PETS Project Director, (who also serves as ENCPTC Site Director) and the Recruiter/Mentor work with the Financial Aid Directors of the six colleges to provide approximately 295 students with scholarships or stipends over a 4-year grant period. This program enables students to progressively increase their amount of assistance as they prove their potential and reach certain milestones."
