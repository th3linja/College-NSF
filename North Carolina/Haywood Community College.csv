"1303996","Dual Enrollment Technician Pathways and Careers in Electronics Engineering and Computer Integrated Machining","DUE","ADVANCED TECH EDUCATION PROG","07/01/2013","09/05/2014","Deborah Porto","NC","Haywood Community College","Standard Grant","Elizabeth Teles","07/31/2015","$193,588.00","Matt Heimburg","portod@bellsouth.net","185 Freedlander Drive","Clyde","NC","287219441","8286272821","EHR","7412","1032, 9178, SMET","$0.00","This project is designed to recruit rural high school students into community college technician degree programs that are linked to manufacturing jobs in the region. The project activities include: 1) developing a new Electronics Engineering Technology dual-enrollment program, 2) creating awareness among high school and college counselors, teachers and faculty, parents and students on the content of and career potential for Electronics Engineering and Computer-Integrated Machining technicians, 3) providing activities including summer camps to increase the recruitment of female and male high school students to dual enrollment technology programs, and 4) educating high school and college counselors on technician careers through externships and return to industry programs. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project is improving student learning in engineering technician programs by building on a pilot dual enrollment technician program established in computer-integrated machining. It is adapting materials, methods, and marketing materials from ATE Centers in Florida, Connecticut, and South Carolina. To increase opportunities for students to work in high paying jobs in manufacturing, the project is focusing on groups that are currently underrepresented in the field, particularly females. There is strong institutional support and there are strong partnerships with the public school system, manufacturers, and the economic development community.<br/> <br/>Broader Impact: In order to meet the skills gap faced by regional manufacturers, the project is developing and strengthening a pipeline of skilled employees for area manufacturers that is not dependent on incumbent worker retraining. The creation of a close partnership between manufacturers, the community college and the high schools is providing a response to changing technology in manufacturing to ensure their long term profitability. The expansion of dual enrollment programs is affording students new career options not previously understood and doubling the pipeline by focusing on both females and males. Long term, the success of the project is enabling the development of additional technician dual enrollment programs and creating a model Career Academy for high school students that can be adapted by other rural communities."

This project refines, expands, and institutionalizes adoption of L-SITEs through a collaborative of community colleges, industry experts, and national organizations. Participant support is increasing the numbers of institutions and faculty who use the simulation. Each participating college takes part in faculty workshops for training on implementation and adaptation of L-SITEs, scenarios, and website use. Project teams serve as facilitators, augmented by industry and academic partners. User feedback provides continuous improvement, and project management upgrades L-SITEs through enhanced design and technology of web-based delivery. Students experience longitudinal impact of business and technical decisions via enhanced business and financial management methods, which allow simulated enterprises to track and link financials like profit and loss over semester and longer timeframes. To increase breadth and depth, L-SITEs' content integrates IT skills standards, as developed by the National Workforce Center for Emerging Technologies; and creates a model for innovative 'soft skills' certification. A partnership with technical colleges from the Trans-Atlantic Technology and Training Alliance-funded through the European Union-makes L-SITEs a more widely adopted learning environment with an international business element."
