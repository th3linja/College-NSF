The instrument is being used in the organic laboratory for regular experiments, such as qualitative analysis for functional groups and is improving the students learning efficiency as well as the department's instructional capability. Students are also doing special projects such as a kinetic and mechanism study and structural analysis of the products of oxidation reactions of various alcohols using a variety of oxidizing agents. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources."
