The project is aligning the educational practices with industry expectations in an effort to increase the enrollment of students and better define career pathways. The project is being informed by the SC ATE Center of Excellence and the National Geospatial Technology Center. SC ATE Center's successful internship, student recruitment, and industry consortium models are being adapted and implemented for this project. The TIMSGeoTech is advancing knowledge and understanding in many fields involving geospatial technology, geographic information systems and science aligning graduates and their skills with industry needs through tiered internship experiences. It is also facilitating communication among sectors (academic, industry, and government) to improve the relevance of coursework to today's geospatial applications. This is allowing resources of various organizations to be combined to provide valuable experiences for participants. Establishing paid internships and scholarships should develop this project into a self-sustaining program. The Tiered Internship Model can be adapted by two- and four-year colleges preparing geospatial technicians as it creates a system for partnering with industry so that they can 'grow their own' future workforce by tapping students early in the educational process and grooming them for possible future employment with the company after graduation. TIMSGeoTech is bringing together a diverse group of industry stakeholders to create opportunities for partnerships and networking for students, educators, and professionals. TIMSGeoTech is enhancing the involvement of under-represented groups through outreach to workforce development offices by providing links to unemployed and underemployed individuals."

This model starts with a three-hour national teleconference event featuring a panel discussion and multimedia presentation of a new computer networking curriculum. The panelists include faculty who have implemented the new curriculum, industry partners, and members of professional organizations, such as the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the National Association of Communications Systems Engineers(NACSE). <br/><br/>The teleconference is a starting point for a series of activities to provide the necessary resources to two-year college faculty and administrators to adapt and implement an associate degree curriculum in computer networking. Twenty prime sites will be identified to participate in the project and to receive matching support to develop this track. Other sites can also participate as viewers of the national teleconference. This curriculum track is a component of the recently completed ACM Guidelines for Degree and Certificate Programs to Support Computing in a Networked Environment produced by the ACM Two-Year College Education Committee. <br/><br/>The measurable objectives of this project include: 1) identification of a variety of resources to support adaptation and implementation of the associate degree and certificate programs in networking; 2) identification of twenty institutions across the United States to be prime sites to implement the new curriculum; 3) dissemination of information and strategies for adapting and implementing the new curriculum by means of the teleconference event; 4) establishment of a uniform evaluation protocol to be used across the 20 primary sites to validate the model; 5) establishment of a discussion forum for the participants to enable communication and sharing of resources; and 6) provision of ongoing assistance, mentoring and peer support to facilitate the adaptation and implementation process."
