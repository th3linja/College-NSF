These approaches facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.<br/><br/>Beginning FY2016, LSAMP now accepts proposals for ""pre-alliance planning grants"" that would support the planning necessary for developing the partnerships and activities required to form new alliances (including Bridge to the Baccalaureate). The expected outcomes of these grants include: (i) commitment from institutional leaders and STEM faculty at partner institutions; (ii) evidence of cohesive partnerships between institutions; (iii) creation of a vision and/or theme for a future alliance; and (iv) comprehensive plans for alliance activities that would lead to the submission of an LSAMP (alliance) proposal.<br/><br/>With the ultimate goal of forming a Bridge to the Baccalaureate alliance in the Denver metropolitan area, the Community College of Aurora (lead institution) is partnering with four other community colleges in the Colorado Community College System to determine how to collectively build on the successes in STEM at the individual campuses and expand the evidence-based practices implemented at the collaborating colleges. Thus, the five partner institutions(Community College of Aurora, Arapahoe Community College, the Community College of Denver, Front Range Community College, and Red Rocks Community College) in their proposed ""Mapping a Pathway"" project will use the pre-alliance planning grant to collect baseline data, identify barriers that are inhibiting the progress and graduation of students underrepresented in STEM, analyze the recruitment and retention strategies as well as transfer processes, and evaluate institutional infrastructure for supporting alliance objectives."

This project addresses regional workforce needs for GIS-related skills by introducing students to GIS via an experiential, modular unit within a course of study. The GIS Faculty Institute uses a two-pronged approach: (1) faculty learn to use basic GIS applications and receive support in designing and delivering their own module for use in a class; and (2) faculty learn about occupational applications of GIS in the Denver Metropolitan region through guest lectures and industry field trips. Several hundred students are using the GIS modules in classes taught by the faculty and are gaining problem solving and collaborative skills while becoming aware of GIS career opportunities. GIS occupational information and learning experiences are also being included in a variety of student activities throughout the year, thus impacting the entire college. While the GIS Faculty Institute is impacting faculty and students at the Community College of Aurora, this project also contributes to ongoing national efforts to develop models of ways to incorporate GIS into existing community college curricula. In coordination with the ATE GeoTech Center, this project is disseminating its findings to the broad academic community working to address the challenge of igniting interest in, and knowledge of, GIS as an occupational option for students."

Twelve scholarships will be offered at the beginning of each academic year to begin a new cohort of STEM scholars.  The program includes comprehensive support and transition services, with a particular emphasis on cohort development and support.  These activities will increase STEM course success, program retention, and graduation and four-year transition rates. Program graduates will contribute to the continued success of the aerospace, software, and other technology-based industries in the region.  Scholarships for academically strong students, who may not otherwise be able to afford college, will increase the number of graduates prepared to support national, regional, and local companies. The success of the program will produce a well-trained workforce that will contribute to the economic growth of Colorado and the nation.<br/><br/>Through this S-STEM program the Community College of Aurora (CCA) will conduct a five-year effort to recruit, support, and graduate students with academic talent and demonstrated financial need. The program will provide twelve scholarships in years one and five of the program, and twenty-four in years two, three, and four.  A new cohort of STEM scholars will begin at the start of each academic year. Scholarships will renew for a second year provided scholars meet academic targets and other program requirements. CCA will encourage applications from first generation, women and students from groups currently underrepresented in STEM professions. Improved retention and increased graduation rates will be achieved through comprehensive support and transition services, with a particular emphasis on CCA-based STEM faculty and cohort support.  Mentoring will include regular meetings with an assigned STEM faculty mentor. Learning community activities organized around cohorts will focus on study and tutoring needs, guest lectures on STEM careers, visits to STEM companies and four-year academic programs, and other career development activities. Lessons learned and effective practices that emerge from the program evaluation will be disseminated to the STEM education community and help increase widespread understanding of the attributes and practices of successful student scholarship and support programs."

Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.<br/><br/>For the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  The Metro Denver STEM Alliance (MDSA), a LSAMP Bridge to the Baccalaureate Alliance project led by the Community College of Aurora and in partnership with four community colleges - Arapahoe Community College, Community College of Denver, Front Range Community College, and Red Rocks Community College - was formed in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce.  That need still exists and is particularly acute in the State of Colorado.  MDSA will build on research-based models which have proven successful in improving degree completion outcomes for underrepresented minority (URM) STEM students through a focus on engagement, capacity building and continuity.  This focus supports the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to ""cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.""  In support of the focus, the Alliance will engage targeted students in STEM exposure, career and degree planning activities; enhance students' capacity to apply STEM knowledge and skills through project-based learning, hands-on workshops, and undergraduate research experiences; and promote students' continuity through accelerated math remediation, STEM degree progress tracking and coaching, and four-year STEM baccalaureate transfer support.  The Alliance will result in systemic support to URM students from their entrance into community college, throughout their foundational STEM coursework, and to four-year institution transfer, with ultimate engagement in a successful STEM career.  Each strategy adopted by the Alliance is based on best practices for cultivating students' knowledge, skills, and transfer readiness, and informed by an equity approach in which the partner institutions recognize the need to create the conditions in which URM students can succeed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
