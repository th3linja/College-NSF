The project aims to improve educational opportunities for STEM students, increase the retention of STEM students to degree achievement and/or transfer, and enhance student support programs for STEM students. The scholarship recipients are working with faculty mentors, student services advisors specific to scholarship recipients, and fellow students to engage in a variety of program activities designed to provide academic, professional and personal growth opportunities. The project helps the scholarship recipients, including first-generation students and underrepresented minority students, complete an AS degree and/or transfer to a baccalaureate degree-granting institution. The resulting S-STEM education model is being disseminated to and shared with other community colleges and post-secondary schools in the Denver region."

Business, industry, and government need well-prepared technicians who can prevent, detect, and investigate cybersecurity breaches.  The growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have appropriate, specific knowledge and skills. Nationwide, employer surveys indicate that only a small percentage of universities and colleges fully prepare graduates for cybersecurity jobs.  Colorado is a major hub for cybersecurity jobs, with over 9,000 open cybersecurity positions in the Denver Metro and Colorado Springs areas, which are served by the college. Over 1,200 of these jobs can be filled by individuals who have an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree. This project will prepare well-qualified cybersecurity professionals and information security analysts to benefit the regional workforce. The project will create and implement a responsive AAS cybersecurity program aligned with business needs and Federal standards. The approach will focus on integrating experiential and project-based learning to provide students with real-world experiences, to create seamless continuity from classroom to workforce, and to equip students with 21st-century employability skills. The college intends to achieve a Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense designation. This designation, along with mapping the curriculum to the Federal standards, will equip students with the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to protect and defend the nation's infrastructure. The project will also focus on increasing the participation of women in cybersecurity. <br/><br/>The project has three goals: (1) to address the unmet demand for cybersecurity technicians in the region served by the college; (2) to enhance gender diversity in cybersecurity by recruiting more female students into the program (the aim is for at least 20% of the students to be women); and (3) to improve retention and persistence in the attainment of an AAS degree in cybersecurity. The project will adopt, adapt, and evaluate materials and methods developed through the Colorado Community College System, the National CyberWatch Center, and other NSF Advanced Technological Education projects.  It will also develop a new course in Security Risk Management. Collaboration with a regional Business and Industry Leadership Team will ensure that the project can create a robust curriculum that provides seamless continuity from the classroom to the workplace and meets industry standards. In addition, collaboration with a subject matter expert on diversity and organizational change, along with partnerships with high schools, will facilitate the recruitment, retention, and completion of women in the college's cybersecurity program. By using distance education and remote-access labs, the project will reach beyond Colorado. The new courses that are developed will be added to the CCCS database and will be available for all 13 colleges in the system and other colleges across the nation. The best practices that are discovered will be disseminated nationally through the National CyberWatch Center, ATE Central, the Community College Cyber Summit, and the National Convergence Technology Center, as well as through national conferences that focus on cybersecurity and experiential education.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program, which focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

ICT Education is changed to become responsive to the workforce needs of high-growth industries. This Colorado ATE Partnership (CATEP) project: (1) Strengthens the participating colleges' CIS introductory curriculum and associated Career and Technical Education (CTE) courses through the integration of employability skills with technical skills; (2) Transforms the recruitment, curriculum and pedagogical practices employed in CIS and CTE courses; (3) Addresses industry needs beyond basic IT skills; (4) Develops an ongoing evaluation program to ensure students meet the ICT workforce needs of the region's high-growth industries; and (5) Develops a dissemination plan to share the resulting ICT workforce education model with the other community colleges and secondary schools in the region. This project takes advantage of established relationships between postsecondary partners, industry representatives, the secondary education systems in the service areas of the respective community colleges, and pertinent Workforce Development agencies. It also incorporates best practices generated from research by the National Workforce Center for Emerging Technologies, the Center for Information Technology Education, Boston Area Advanced Technological Education Connections and the South Carolina Advanced Technological Education Center."
