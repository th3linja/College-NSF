Red Rocks Community College, Lakewood, Colorado in partnership with the Colorado School of Mines will develop new approaches and models that better engage and support LIFG students in pre-engineering programs in order to provide deeper and more integrated learning experiences.  This will lead to improved success, retention, and transfer to four-year institutions for LIFG students in engineering.<br/><br/>Four types of interrelated activities are proposed for the LIFG engineering students and STEM faculty at Red Rocks Community College.  First, faculty workshops, conferences, and discussions will be used to develop shared understandings of the challenges facing LIFG students.  STEM faculty will serve as transforming agents by developing new pedagogies and meaningful mentorships that enrich teaching and learning in the STEM disciplines.  Second, nontraditional mentoring strategies and a STEM 101 course will be developed to address how social and cultural capital contribute to self-efficacy and academic success for LIFG students.  Students completing STEM 101 will participate in activities leading to authentic research opportunities in engineering at the Colorado School of Mines.  These undergraduate research experiences will draw on and reinforce students' STEM knowledge and build expertise in engineering.  Third, students will be provided with opportunities for experiential learning on engineering projects directly relevant to their lives and their communities.  These will be based on an Introduction to Design and Engineering Applications (IDEA) program already developed by Red Rocks Community College in collaboration with the Colorado School of Mines and the Engineering by Doing (EbD) program developed by the Humanitarian Engineering program at the Colorado School of Mines.  Fourth, the partnership between Red Rocks Community College and the Colorado School of Mines will be developed as a model for building community college-university collaborations that provide LIFG students with stronger academic preparation and more accessible pathways for transfer to 4-year institutions and for developing careers in engineering.<br/><br/>The project will investigate how these activities contribute to STEM learning and retention through a pre/post design that will compare a set of metrics that establish baseline measures of retention, success in gatekeeper  courses, number of STEM students who reach second tier STEM courses, and success in these courses.  Information also will be collected through student and faculty surveys, inventories, questionnaires, direct observations, and academic capstone assessments of integrated learning.  The goals are to generate models and evidence on these approaches and provide materials that will be useful for other community colleges struggling to address the important issues of low enrollment, poor performance, weak retention, and lack of persistence among low-income and first-generation students in engineering and STEM."

Red Rocks Community College, the Jefferson County School District and the University of Colorado at Denver have created an alliance known as the Denver Metro Teacher Preparation Partnership (DMTPP) for the purpose of increasing the number of certified teachers with degree credentials in mathematics, and the sciences, and demonstrable competencies in the integration of technological tools in classroom instruction. The project includes recruitment of prospective teachers, teacher educator development, and pre-teaching experiences. An integrated advising network comprised of advisors from each partner institution supports the degree planning and efficient transfer from high school Teacher Cadet programs to the community college and on to the university. High school and community college students interested in teaching are participating in an intensive summer camp program hosted by the University of Colorado at Denver to introduce the teaching profession and life as an undergraduate teacher candidate. The project includes strategies for recruiting paraprofessionals into the preservice program. As instructors of prospective teachers, science and mathematics secondary and postsecondary faculty receive professional support from faculty trainers from the Rocky Mountain Teacher Collaborative in the integration of inquiry-driven learning. A Technology of Teaching Certificate is facilitating cohort teams comprised of prospective teachers and classroom teachers in the development of interactive standards based curriculum using technological adaptations to increase student achievement. Mediated internships in secondary classrooms mentored by master classroom teachers from Professional Development Schools (PDS), tutoring of secondary students and co-leading special science and technology projects sponsored by professional societies and museums with secondary students from high risk populations are strategies of the DMTPP that support the pre service preparation of prospective secondary teachers."

The Technical Education Pathways (TEP) produces skilled technicians with improved skill adaptability as a result of integrated classroom and internship experiences reinforcing real world application of science, and mathematics. <br/><br/>Through adaptation of promising approaches in the marketing of technical career education developed by other National Science Foundation grantees, career awareness activities with high school students includes job shadowing and real opportunities to interact in the technical workplace. A college level course offered for high school students introduces the application of science and mathematics and effective communication in the workplace as students are prepared for matriculation as college freshmen with improved academic competencies. <br/><br/>Faculty development joins secondary faculty of mathematics and the sciences with the postsecondary technical faculty in collegial exchanges improves the integration of the core academic subjects with the application that occurs in the technical work place. Faculty are engaged in developing an instructional approach that facilitates learning by encouraging active inquiry-based exploration that coaches learners in the multiple applications of the theoretical knowledge in the sciences and mathematics. The postsecondary classrooms and laboratories replicate the technology in the manipulation of the tools and the equipment found in the actual technical workplace as college freshmen are prepared in a series of paid internships and apprenticeships. Professional practicing technicians are prepared through training provided by the TEP as workplace mentors in the guidance of the prospective technician student in the integration of the new knowledge gained in the classroom with real work using the principles of contextual learning. Students are engaged in project-based learning in the workplace, using mathematic and scientific concepts to solve problems and honing reasoning skills useful in diagnosing and resolving problems yet to be encountered. At the completion of the applied associate of science program, the new technician has multiple career options as well as opportunities to continue his or her undergraduate studies with universities offering articulation for the graduating technician. <br/><br/>"

The Center is a consortium of the community colleges with the Colorado Institute of Technology, the National Workforce Center for Emerging Technologies and a proposed Colorado IT Industry Advisory Council. A technology symposium is held to engage industry and colleges in a dialogue about key issues. Industry needs to become aware of the roles for two-year college graduates in IT. The IT curricula in two-year colleges need to be upgraded and expanded based upon standards and industry requirements. The faculty, teachers, counselors and administrators need ongoing professional development. Students need to be provided consistent information and advising about IT positions. This symposium serves to develop the basis for the Center."
