Projects supported by the HSI program will also generate new knowledge about how to achieve these aims.  This project fulfills part of those aims by building capacity at Pueblo Community College to meet the needs of low-income students in the STEM pipeline.  The project will create a STEM professional development program, enhance student supports, and develop co-requisite supplemental instruction. It is expected that these capacity building efforts will increase student enrollment and graduation rates in STEM programs at Pueblo Community College. This project will also engage students in STEM careers through partnerships with local industry so that students can build a future in STEM. <br/><br/>The project will develop the Pueblo Community College educational experience that includes campus outreach, targeted recruitment, curricular redesign, close advising, academic alerts, and faculty/staff professional development. The goal of the project is to increase STEM student success, including enrollment, performance, persistence, graduation, and the transfer to four-year STEM degree programs. Students will receive faculty mentoring to improve self-efficacy and scientific literacy. Learning will be enhanced via the creation of unique supplemental instruction courses to improve academic performance, self-efficacy, and persistence. The supplemental instruction structure will be developed for mathematics, biology, and physical sciences course often taken by first-semester students. The supplemental instruction in science courses will include interactions with STEM faculty mentors, student peer mentors, and industry partners to further connect the course content to STEM programs and careers. This project will investigate how to develop effective personal, curriculum, and academic supports that promote student enrollment and persistence in STEM majors. By collecting both quantitative and qualitative data, the project will generate new knowledge about factors that stimulate student success in STEM at the community college level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project seeks to develop a seamless pathway from high school to two-year institutions, and then to a four-year institution.  This pathway includes alignment of STEM curricula to enhance the transition from an associate degree to bachelor's degrees in STEM, with a focus on cybersecurity. The project aims to increase student enrollment and engagement in STEM coursework at two-year institutions, improve the transition from lower- to upper-division coursework, and develop culturally based educational and support practices that contribute to student success.<br/><br/>By developing a transition pathway in technology and cybersecurity, the project seeks to increase the enrollment, retention, and graduation rates of STEM students, particularly of Hispanic students and students from other groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields. To enhance their engagement in STEM, students will participate in the National Cyber League boot camp training and cybersecurity competitions. The project will facilitate professional development in cultural responsibility and sensitivity for teachers, advisors, coaches, and administrators at participating high schools, community colleges, and universities. The project will use quantitative and qualitative metrics to investigate how the project activities impact student enrollment and graduation rates in STEM, with emphasis on technology and cybersecurity programs. Data from this research project will be analyzed using structured equation modeling methodology to reveal significant path coefficients and goodness-of-fit model indices for both the community college and university research models. The project aims to develop a model that may be implemented at other institutions seeking to develop associate-to-bachelor degree pathways. Results and findings will be shared via conference presentations and academic journal publications. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
