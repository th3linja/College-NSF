Specifically, this project will support students at Front Range Community College and Colorado State University. Front Range Community College is the largest community college in Colorado.  It has a diverse student body and is the largest source of transfer students to Colorado State University. Over the project's five-year duration, the project will provide up to four years of scholarship support for at least 150 STEM students.  These students will pursue associate's and bachelor's degrees in mathematics, life sciences, physical sciences, engineering, or computer sciences. A team of faculty and student success coaches will contribute to Scholars' success by: implementing Scholars' onboarding into a math and science learning community at both institutions; developing Scholars' knowledge and skills; ensuring transfer continuity through curriculum mapping and articulation; providing hands-on experiences; and mentoring the Scholars. This project is significant because it will integrate national best practices for improving student retention, transfer, and degree completion that are being adopted by community colleges nationwide. Broader impacts of this project include narrowing of educational gaps in Colorado and increasing the diversity of students completing STEM degrees. Its intellectual merit lies in a research study that will evaluate the use of near-term measures of student success (academic momentum) to predict and support long-term success.  <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. Specifically, this project aims to increase the number of low-income, academically talented students from Front Range Community College who complete a STEM associate degree, transfer to Colorado State University, and complete a STEM baccalaureate degree. The specific aims are: 1) optimizing enrollment and persistence of low-income, academically talented students from Front Range Community College Math and Science Career and Academic Community; 2) increasing Scholar's STEM engagement, knowledge, and skills; and 3) improving continuity and articulation in the transfer process to increase student success. This project's research component will generate new knowledge about best practices for supporting baccalaureate degree completion of STEM students who begin their education at a two-year colleges.  The research project will measure the effect of scholarships and the project's activities on student self-efficacy, science identity, and academic momentum. The project expects that academic momentum metrics will provide actionable data that may be better suited for measuring success of interventions than retention/completion metrics. An external evaluator will measure the extent of implementation of the project's activities, who participated, and if the project's objectives are met using formative and summative mixed-method measures. This project's outcomes and research findings will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals, posted on websites such as the Department of Education's ""What Works Clearinghouse,"" and presented at regional and national conferences. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The American Geosciences Institute 2014 Workforce Report predicts a workforce shortage of ~135,000 geoscientists by 2022. Increasingly, students begin their undergraduate careers in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines at community colleges, making the transition between two-year and four-year undergraduate institutions a critical juncture for ensuring student retention and success.  Providing students with authentic experiences in STEM through research experiences and internships, as well as helping students to understand the career opportunities available to them in the geosciences, to develop the academic and professional skills needed to succeed in those careers, and to identify the mentors and networks that can support them along the way, are proven best practices for retaining students in STEM pathways. Given the very diverse demographic make-up of students attending community colleges, successful transfer of these students into four-year degree programs helps to broaden participation of traditionally underrepresented students in STEM and the geosciences.<br/><br/>FRCC and UNAVCO are collaborating to implement a tiered, student-focused program that provides community college students in Colorado with experiential learning opportunities in the geosciences.  The Geo-Launchpad program is creating an entry point into geo-focused careers for students through a structured experience, starting with introductory workshops and webinars to engage students, develop career awareness and initiate mentoring and networking.  Motivated students move into a semester-long special topics course in geoscience designed to build student capacity, and reinvorce engagement.  For a select group of students, the program culminates in an 8-week paid summer internship experience at UNAVCO, which provides continuity of the community college geoscience pathway with the industry and advanced education programs at Colorado's research institutions. Students work in teams on projects focused on solid earth, cryosphere, environmental science, hydrogeodesy, and ocean/atmosphere applications of global postitioning system (GPS) technologies. Each intern is supported by 3 mentors, one of which is located at their home institution. In addition to increasing geoscience content knowledge, the Geo-Launchpad program activities help students build basic skills in critical thinking, data analysis, communication, and organization.  An annual mini-symposium at UNAVCO provides faculty and students from around the state of Colorado with information regarding the Geo-Launchpad programs, as well as professional development related to mentoring and advising. After the initial phases of implementating the program at FRCC, the project will recruit and make available online many of the resources to other community college students throughout the state."

In northern Colorado, advanced manufacturing companies have specifically noted a critical need for industrial maintenance workers. To help fill this need, Front Range Community College will design and implement a new associate degree program that will prepare students to be industrial maintenance technicians. The project team will work in partnership with local manufacturing companies in northern Colorado to develop courses for the program. These courses will include active learning and skills-building instruction on new training equipment to provide industry-relevant learning experiences for students. This innovative degree program will provide students with options of certificates that can be stacked toward the associate degree as part of an approach for career advancement. The program will also provide the opportunity for students to obtain industry-recognized certifications. The certifications will help demonstrate students' readiness for employment. As a result, the project has the potential to increase the number of skilled industrial maintenance technicians available to meet workforce needs.<br/><br/>This project will seek to: 1) provide enhanced learning experiences for engineering technology students that respond to critical needs of the Northern Colorado advanced manufacturing industry; and 2) grow and diversify the regional industrial maintenance technician workforce. The project team will design a new Associate of Applied Science degree in automation and engineering technology, in close collaboration with subject matter experts in local manufacturing industries. The new curriculum will use state-of-the-art industrial training equipment to incorporate hands-on experiences that help students develop needed skills, including skills in electrical circuits and instrumentation, industrial motors and controls, basic machining, fluid power, and mechanical systems. The two-year course of study will include two stackable certificates. At the end of the first year in the program, students will earn a certificate in Industrial Maintenance. During the second year, students will be able to earn an Industrial Automation and Robotics certificate, as well as complete the National Institute of Metalworking Skills (NIMS) Certification tests for Process Control Systems (Duty Area 7). Student performance on the NIMS testing will be used to study the effects of the new curriculum on student learning outcomes. The innovative structuring of the course sequences will enable students to gain marketable skills after only one year and will help provide a shortened path to an entry-level job for students who may have financial obstacles. This flexible structuring will also be used to attract, recruit, and retain more students from underserved and underrepresented populations within the region. The content in the new degree program, the project results, and best practices will be disseminated in the local community, regionally, and nationally.  This project is funded by the NSF Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many employers require at least a year of practical work experience, which is often a significant barrier for recent two-year college graduates. This barrier is especially true for low-income students, because they often work in an unrelated field while completing their coursework. This project will offer students in the Geospatial Science program an opportunity to work with external partners on real-world geospatial projects as they complete degrees and/or certificates. Each year, twenty students will have a paid internship with an industry employer, which will allow students to apply the technical skills acquired through coursework, gain work experience, and build project management, critical thinking, and professional skills. Thus, these work experiences will support learning outcomes in students' courses and increase the employability of graduates. Students will also host active learning workshops for middle and high school students from neighboring school districts that serve a large underrepresented student population.  These workshops aim to raise awareness and engage secondary school students in exploring and pursuing technical careers in the geospatial sciences.<br/><br/>This project will offer a novel internship approach by providing:  1) traditional, in-person work projects in collaboration with northern Colorado workforce partners; and 2) virtual projects in collaboration with the national ATE GeoTech Center. This project will pilot one of the first virtual internship programs for geospatial community college students in the nation. Geospatial Science students, with oversight from faculty mentors, will build a middle and high school geospatial educational pipeline by hosting active learning workshops using unmanned aerial vehicles. The workshops will introduce students, including young women and underrepresented students, to geospatial education and career paths, with the goal of increasing diversity in the geoscience workforce. The workshops will simultaneously develop middle and high school students' knowledge of geospatial education and careers while providing a near-peer teaching experience for community college students. As part of project dissemination, the project will develop a best practices guide for building virtual geospatial internship program.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
