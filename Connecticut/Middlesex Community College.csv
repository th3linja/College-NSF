Supporting activities include  teacher and faculty training, industry mentor education, program  materials development, job shadowing, and the recruitment and  retention of underrepresented groups of students. Principal  collaborators are a two-year college, high schools, 4-year colleges  and universities, biotechnological industry, government, and public  schools. Biotechnology programs are being articulated for different  educational levels, and major developments include classroom and  multimedia materials. Also, developed materials are being  disseminated through various media, such as publications, videos,  electronic linkages, workshops, and conferences."

A total of 60 faculty (36 from the institution and 24 from other two-year colleges and high schools) are participating in the project. Project activities involve one or more of the following: (1) math faculty mentors assisting non-math faculty with integrating math into modules within their courses; (2) connected courses where math and non-math faculty from other disciplines design joint curriculum modules to be used in both courses; (3) service learning/civic engagement initiatives incorporated as part of course activities to strengthen student understanding of the ways in which mathematics is used to understand and solve problems within the larger community; and (4) design of interdisciplinary learning communities that integrate math and non-math courses. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project goals are to: (1) strengthen students' quantitative literacy by providing opportunities across the curriculum to experience linkages between mathematics, other subject areas, and daily life; (2) provide training and support to faculty so that they can create modules, connected courses, and learning communities that highlight mathematics dimensions within their disciplines; (3) create a college-wide culture that acknowledges the value of Mathematics Across the Curriculum; and (4) share strategies, curriculum and results with other faculty across the region and nation. Project activities include summer institutes to provide faculty with initial training, ongoing consultation as initiatives are implemented, annual end-of-semester retreat to review outcomes, assessment and evaluation, and regional and national dissemination. It supports the achievement of the college's new institutional student learning outcomes related to critical thinking and communication. It also offers additional strategies to address high numbers of students failing or not completing developmental math courses at the college. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The project is assuring that students can not only utilize mathematical skills in the workplace, but also can analyze, understand, and discuss a range of mathematical, scientific, and cultural issues that impact their lives and communities. By learning mathematics in the context of issues that are meaningful to them, students gain lifelong quantitative literacy and numeracy skills. Because faculty model best practices in mathematics instruction and there are a large number of preservice teachers at the college, the project also impacts those preparing for teaching careers, the vast majority of whom will teach at the preK-12 level. This project increases opportunities for many minority students to achieve math competencies in both developmental and required college-level courses, to obtain a certificate or associate degree, and to transfer to a four-year college and/or enter the workforce. In years two and three, faculty from other colleges and high schools also develop MAC projects for their institutions. While the three-year student impact is projected at 1500 students, the long-term impact on numbers of students will be even greater as faculty continue to infuse mathematics across the curriculum."

The project includes an in-depth workforce needs and job skills analysis to determine the regional technical workforce requirements related to nanotechnology and other relevant emerging technologies. In addition, the project includes professional development in nanotechnology for faculty and the development and the revision of curriculum to integrate nanotechnology into current courses in response to the workforce needs analysis. The project is building institutional capacity to provide education and training to support future workforce development related to nanotechnology and other emerging technologies. Other participants in the project include North Shore Community College and universities with extensive nanotechnology research: the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, Northeastern University, and University of Massachusetts, Amherst."

We have had considerable success in revising our curriculum to encourage student-driven inquiry, which will be enhanced by this equipment. The target audience for this project consists of A&P students, 90 percent of whom are women preparing for careers in the health fields. Most of these students are academically under-prepared, lack self-confidence, and are intimidated by science. Computer applications will be extremely useful in helping students to overcome such obstacles. The hardware and software to be purchased under this grant will enable students to engage in hands-on experimentation, analyze data more effectively, work collaboratively, and use a multi-media form of the human body to deepen their understanding of human anatomy. This project will demonstrate that the careful and systematic incorporation of new technologies into the laboratory can have significant positive impact in raising the level of scientific understanding and achievement on the part of often-disadvantaged community college students."
