This project is developing an advanced manufacturing technician associate degree program that is designed to increase the number of skilled workers in the northwest corner of Connecticut (CT) and provide a pathway where students can pursue associate and bachelor degrees in manufacturing so they can advance their careers. The college is partnering with three school systems, the Northwest Connecticut Manufacturers Coalition (NCMC), and Regional Center for Next Generation Manufacturing (RCNGM). In addition, the college is a long-standing member of the Connecticut College of Technology (COT). As such, the college and its partners benefit from the best practices, curriculum, and articulations developed by the COT.<br/><br/>The project is increasing the partnerships between higher education and industry by creating a manufacturing technology program and a career pathway that can be adopted by other high schools and community colleges especially those in rural areas, and by increasing the number of high school and community college students interested in pursuing careers in manufacturing.<br/><br/>Surveys of the manufacturers in the northwest region helped to identify four industry-driven, workforce-based needs that are being addressed in this project:<br/>1. Recruitment: Recruiting a skilled manufacturing workforce requires raising awareness of career possibilities within advanced technology and manufacturing fields. This project is continuing with current outreach programs to junior high and high school students to inform future skilled workers. It is also exposing unemployed, underemployed, displaced, and incumbent workers to the necessary skill sets and career possibilities of manufacturing within northwestern CT.<br/>2. Education: A majority of manufacturers in advanced technological sectors nationwide indicate that they have a difficult time filling positions because applicants lack the necessary skills for the job. This project is developing a degree pathway that provides workers with advanced technology skills to meet workforce needs.<br/>3. Retention: Manufacturing employers in northwestern CT have difficulty retaining employees who live outside of the area. Many employees who have the appropriate skills do not want to travel or move to rural CT and therefore end up leaving after they are trained. This project is focusing on providing people who already live in the northwest corner of the state with the skills and education they need to obtain jobs in the advanced manufacturing sector.<br/>4. Continued education and career advancement: Modern manufacturing requires workers to keep up with technology. Incumbent workers also need skills for advancement. Both of these require a strong partnership between manufacturers and the college. This project strengthens that collaboration and provides workers with a pathway to advance their education.<br/><br/>"

In addition, Jackson Laboratory, the leading bioscience company in the area, is located twenty miles away. These companies need employees at all levels of skills and knowledge, from technicians to engineers and research scientists. They rely on an educational infrastructure to provide a capable, industry-ready workforce. However, there is a gap between the industry demand and availability of skilled workers, and neither the technical high school nor the college is currently meeting these needs. For example, in the robotics and automation areas, industry need exceeds the trained workforce by almost 68%. According to the 2016 Chamber of Commerce Survey of Northwest Connecticut, maintaining and growing manufacturing was one of the highest priorities in the region and the lack of skilled applicants was cited as being the biggest barrier. This project, Engaging Students from Classrooms and Camps to College and Careers, brings 7th-12th grade teachers, community college faculty, students, and industry members together to develop a strong technical workforce. <br/><br/>This project aims to increase the STEM interest and skills attainment of underrepresented and socioeconomically disadvantaged students in the Torrington School District. It will engage forty-four middle and high school STEM teachers and their students, using innovative activities to introduce students to careers as technicians. Teachers will participate in industry-based externships and professional development workshops.  These activities are designed to help teachers better understand the roles of technicians. Students will participate in college visits and summer camps, designed to help them understand career opportunities for technicians. Community college students will learn about careers as technicians by participating in externships in industry, and will refine their knowledge and skills by serving as teaching assistants in camps and classrooms, and as mentors for the middle and high school students. Through this program, the community college plans to increase the number of dual enrollment college courses for high school students. The program will establish a support system for teachers through the formation of a STEM Community of Practice that includes teachers, college faculty, and industry members. The project activities are expected to support pathways for students to careers in the advanced technological industries in the region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
