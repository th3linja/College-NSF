The project will provide up to two years of scholarship support to students enrolled in associate-level degree programs in STEM fields, including Computer-Aided Design Engineering Technology, Computer information Systems Technology, Electronic Engineering Technology, Engineering Technology, Engineering Science, Environmental Science, Mechanical Engineering Technology, Technology Studies, Automated Manufacturing Engineering Technology, or a Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science Mathematics, or Physics Transfer Ticket degree.  The project intends to overcome cultural and institutional barriers to student success in STEM by providing Scholars with: strong social, academic, and professional support networks; diverse STEM role models;  enhanced STEM identity; training about overcoming adversity;  deeper knowledge of STEM career paths;  transitional education and orientation to college-level expectations; encouragement to use existing support systems;  and opportunities for professional development through research, internships, and job shadowing. The project also seeks to ensure student success beyond graduation through university transfer and job placement supports.  Given the diverse student population at the institution, this project could enhance the diversity of students who pursue STEM degrees. In addition, the large number of scholarships may have a significant impact on both the institution and the development of STEM graduates.     <br/><br/>Through implementation of a set of evidence-based practices, the project has the central goal of improving undergraduate student persistence and academic success in STEM fields. To evaluate the project's success in achieving this goal, project will conduct a quantitative and qualitative assessment to investigate how the project and its individual components affect STEM students' self-efficacy, motivation to pursue a STEM career, STEM identity, and persistence in obtaining a STEM degree. The project seeks to determine effective practices to promote student success, particularly for low-income underrepresented minority STEM students. These results could be valuable to other institutions that seek to develop faculty expertise in effective pedagogies and effective programming to support diverse students seeking STEM degrees.  This project is funded by the NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income, academically high-achieving students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future scientists, engineers, and technicians, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using multiple strategies necessary for the very heterogeneous community college population (which includes many who are underrepresented in STEM careers), PASAL is helping the 1100 current STEM degree students succeed as well as attracting new students; by motivating and reinforcing them through direct, visual, and multiple connections with STEM industry work sites, work experiences, and one-on-one support. In addition to external populations, PASAL focuses activities to attract students on the large pools of students in General Studies and Continuing Education programs. <br/><br/>The PASAL planning and pilot project objectives and methods are:<br/>1. Accelerating an ongoing college effort to expand the number and support level of Industry Partners (IP's). The ideal IP relationship is evolving to include involvement in attraction activities; and/or provision of jobs, scholarships, program financing, tutoring and mentoring.<br/>2. Facilitating prospective and current STEM student exposure to STEM careers, by embedding in college recruitment, orientation, advising, and instruction a variety of Web-based links to STEM employers and Web-based virtual tours which enable visualization of real work sites and tasks.<br/>3. Combining Industry Partner involvement and Web-based material in a concerted effort to attract the college's large population of General Studies majors and Continuing Education students to STEM degree programs.<br/>4. Sustaining STEM student interest and effort through abstract mathematics study that is particularly challenging to community college students with relatively less rigorous preparation, by emphasizing the application of mathematics principles to STEM careers.<br/>5. Sustaining STEM pursuit among the many community college students whose financial, family, and job responsibilities cause even the best students to be at-risk for attrition; through an Early Alert service which proactively identifies, supports and refers students showing early signs of difficulties.<br/><br/>PASAL's intellectual merit is that it helps answer the question of how to increase the supply and success rate of future STEM personnel, including underrepresented groups, who are coming through the large nationwide community college pipeline. PASAL findings are expected to shed light on the extent to which visualization and exposure to STEM careers positively influences students to engage and persist in STEM degree programs, and whether early intervention is an important and effective tool to prevent attrition among community college students.<br/><br/>PASAL's broader impact is that the model is specifically designed to be readily replicated by any community college. Nearly half of U.S. undergraduate student enrollments are in community colleges, and two-year colleges account for over one-third of all undergraduate student enrollments in STEM degree programs. PASAL findings help identify cost-effective strategies that under-resourced colleges can use to attract and sustain students who tend to have multiple barriers, and effective ways to convert the substantial pool of Continuing Education and General Studies students to STEM degree programs."
