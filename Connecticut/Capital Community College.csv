Two-year college students do not have sufficient access in their mathematics courses to real world applications from aeronautics and space technology. The goal of this project is to develop a collection of laboratory/technical activities (LTAs) that significantly contribute to the way in which mathematics from prealgebra through calculus is perceived, taught, and learned in community/technical colleges. The LTAs will be developed by community/technical college faculty working with NASA Scientists/Engineers at the Kennedy Space Center. The LTAs will be based on a wide range of technical problems generated from the science of aeronautics and space. In addition, the project will develop Spinoffs from the LTAs that extend them into other related mathematical areas. The targeted audience includes all community/technical college students of whom significantly more than 50% are women and minorities. ""NASA-AMATYC PC"" is a project coalition involving three organizations: NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), AMATYC (American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges), and CC-TC (Capital Community-Technical College). This project will provide community/technical college students with a collection of real world technological applications. These applications will be embedded in a pedagogical structure that supports AMATYC's Standards. Evaluation, occurring at every stage of the development process, will articulate the LTAs with mathematics education at the secondary school, two and four-year college levels. Dissemination will take place nationally via brochures, booklets and presentations, and globally on the Internet."

The Mobile Computer Science Principles (Mobile CSP) project at the College of St. Scholastica, an established curriculum endorsed by the College Board for its alignment with the Advanced Placement (AP) CSP framework, has formed a Research-Practitioner Partnership (RPP) with CE programs at Capital Community College in Hartford, Connecticut and Southwest Minnesota State University in Minnesota and with partner school districts in each state.<br/><br/>The RPP project explores whether CS through CE can broaden the high school to college pathway in computing disciplines for those traditionally underrepresented in these fields--female, underrepresented minority, and low-SES students. While the AP CSP course has enrolled a more diverse group of students than previous AP CS courses, it is not as diverse as other AP courses. CE programs appear to have better penetration than AP among schools that predominantly serve underrepresented minorities and low-SES students, showing promise for broadening participation in other disciplines and encouraging college matriculation.<br/><br/>By implementing and studying CS through CE in two different contexts (rural and low-SES in Minnesota and urban, diverse, and low-SES in Connecticut), the project contributes to transforming the educational pathways in CS in a variety of contexts and to understanding the supports and barriers to implementing CSP as CE with a broadening-participation goal. This project provides professional development and support of 40 high school teachers to teach a CE version of the Mobile CSP course among partnering school districts over the course of 3 years. The goals of this RPP project are (1) to examine and address the supports and barriers to implementing and sustaining Mobile CSP as a concurrent enrollment course and (2) to study whether a CE implementation of the CSP course broadens participation in computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching goal is to provide, in both near and long term, two-year college faculty and students with a range of classroom materials that foster students' mathematical learning within a context of authentic applications. The project is a collaboration among the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC), and Capital Community-Technical College. Twenty (20) two-year college faculty grouped in two-person teams, will collaborate with Kennedy Space Center scientists and engineers to produce ten (10) Laboratory Technical Activities (LTAs) and twenty (20) Spinoffs. The LTAs are complete learning units that expose two-year college students to the interdependence of technology and mathematics within the framework of the Reform Principles expressed by AMATYC's Crossroads in Mathematics. The Spinoffs range from class-ready learning units to vignettes connecting snapshots of the technological world with mathematics. The development process begins with a 1998 summer workshop at the Kennedy Space Center, extends through four drafting stages with associate reviews, and culminates with dissemination. Dissemination will include presentations at meetings organized by professional associations and via a Web-based electronic book project."

The overall project goal is to provide faculty with a complete package of information and materials for establishing and conducting an interdisciplinary course for the study of mathematics. The package includes (a) ten laboratory exercises, each having a technology problem, a bibliotechnology research exercise, a method to develop the mathematics tools required to solve the problem, a model portfolio, and a thesis defense; (b) initiation of a marketing plan; and (c) initiation of a management plan. Means to accomplish the project objectives involve in-kind support from the American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC), Texas Instruments, and Capital Community College. Twenty AMATYC faculty members have been selected to produce the ten laboratories.<br/><br/>Project outcomes include a laboratory, marketing, and management plan, all of which are being compiled into The Math Works Resource Book, to be published in hard copy and via the Internet. This project is offering a multitude of professional enhancement opportunities to those who develop or use the products developed through this project."
