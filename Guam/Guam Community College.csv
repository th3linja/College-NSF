The goals of the Advanced Technology Developments and Opportunities (ATDAO) project are to produce alternative energy technicians in Guam by (1) generating STEM interest and knowledge among high school students, (2) developing an alternative energy technician education and outreach program at Guam Community College, and (3) promoting secondary and community college faculty participation in local and regional alternative energy workshops. The project is achieving these goals by developing a framework for new courses that will be integrated into existing electronics and civil engineering programs, developing and delivering photovoltaic and wind energy workshops for area high school and community college faculty, training photovoltaic technicians for entry into the workforce, and preparing GCC to receive additional program improvement grants."

Participating in the workshop will be faculty and teachers from schools in the US Pacific Island territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Compact-of-Free-Association countries (CoFA).<br/><br/>This workshop follows the recommendations from a prior workshop, held in 2016, that discussed various barriers that prevent NHPI students from pursuing a STEM career. One of the main issues that surfaced at that workshop was the presence of strong cultural practices that could be seen as a barrier for young students to pursue a STEM career. Currently, there is an imminent risk presented by rising sea levels that have resulted in threats to homes, agriculture and continued residence in some of the islands. Therefore, there is a strong desire to grow native NH and PI talent who have the expertise to address the threats. <br/><br/>The workshop will result in active discussions of the issues facing NHPI, and the creation of plans to address the barriers to STEM participation. It is anticipated that when changes in the curricula and academic structure of some of the island schools are made, more students would be inclined to pursue STEM degrees. An outcome of this workshop will include a written document/report that will be made publicly available. <br/><br/>Increasing the number Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders in STEM fields will allow this group to actively engage in devising solutions to the many problems faced by the islanders due to changing climate. The proposed workshop will provide a group of faculty and staff at schools and colleges across the Pacific with potential solutions to be able to attract more talent into STEM. This project is supported by the Division of Biological Infrastructure in the NSF Directorate for Biological Sciences."
