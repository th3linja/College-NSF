"1711693","Fostering A Community of Scholarship Among Community College STEM Faculty Through Support for Discipline Based Education Research","DUE","IUSE, ECR-EHR Core Research","12/01/2017","12/01/2017","Heather Seitz","KS","Johnson County Community College","Standard Grant","Andrea Nixon","11/30/2020","$295,951.00","Jean Ann Vickers","hseitz@jccc.edu","12345 College Blvd.","Overland Park","KS","662101283","9134698500","EHR","1998, 7980","1545, 8209, 8817, 9150, 9178","$0.00","Discipline-based education research (DBER) has been growing rapidly in recent years. Much of the work undertaken by DBER scholars is applied research in live classrooms in four-year institutions with undergraduate students enrolled for course credit. Many four-year institutions have embraced DBER as a specialty area of expertise for faculty members. Meanwhile, at least half of the students taking courses in STEM disciplines at the lower division level are enrolled in community colleges. Many students who begin college as STEM majors do not succeed in lower division STEM coursework and are unable to continue their STEM studies as juniors and seniors in upper division courses in 4-year institutions. The learning difficulties that STEM majors have as freshmen and sophomores are typically at least as great in community colleges as they are in four-year institutions. Students entering community colleges have very diverse backgrounds and this means the teaching challenges faced by instructors in community colleges are manifold and sometimes unique. Although DBER scholars are able to help improve the design of lower division STEM courses, most DBER research has not been conducted by faculty members teaching in community colleges despite the importance of these colleges to the nation's higher education system. Consequently, it would be ideal to locate some expertise about how students learn STEM within the community college system. That is the goal of this project. <br/><br/>The project will begin to address this imbalance by providing scholarly training in discipline based education research to 18 community college faculty members drawn from three community colleges in the central Midwest: Johnson County Community College, Metropolitan Community College, and Kansas City Community College. The leadership in these community colleges is supportive of this plan to provide intensive training to faculty teaching in STEM disciplines. Participants will be encouraged to participate through course releases and payment honoraria during the summertime. After several years, these new DBER scholars may be in leadership positions to help transform teaching in their institutions. This exploratory design grant will attempt to determine whether this process can take root in community colleges and be an efficient method for expanding deep knowledge about student learning to the other STEM faculty employed in community colleges."

The consortium of three colleges seeks to prototype a model for a ""virtual"" community college that satisfies employer needs for job candidates with relevant hands-on skills and student needs for a coherent course of study from a multi-institutional menu. The project is strengthening the hands-on science content of general education technical math and writing courses, revising a foundation bioscience laboratory skills and safety course, and fostering new relationships across institutional boundaries that support course design and faculty development. Ultimately, the project is preparing community college students for jobs in Greater Kansas City's burgeoning bioscience sector."

This project will develop a support network of student services and cohort-building activities necessary for students through an unprecedented program that brings together departments and offices across campus. The project team will lead a coordinated effort encompassing the JCCC offices of Institutional Research, Financial Aid, Admissions and Counseling, Student Services and regional STEM education organizations.  The project will focus on the impact that individual faculty have on helping community college students successfully transfer to universities.<br/><br/>The project will study the increase on recruitment, retention, graduation, and transfer rates for scholarship students, particularly women and underrepresented minority students in STEM majors. The project will contribute to the literature on STEM education by studying what works in helping STEM students persist to university graduation in a STEM major.  The project team will evaluate the effect that STEM-focused counselors, research opportunities for community college STEM students, and collaboration among community college and university STEM faculty can have on retaining students in STEM majors and aiding them in successfully continuing on for a four-year STEM degree.  This project will establish a replicable model for other community colleges so that they can achieve similar results."

The principal investigators of this collaborative project are creating, implementing, and disseminating curriculum materials for a new course in mathematics for biologists. The course assumes any Calculus I course as a prerequisite and is being developed out of material from courses above Calculus I. The materials are chosen because of their utility to biologists and the topics include: models and date; probability; dynamic models for single populations; discrete dynamical systems (with focus on structured population dynamics); stochastic processes (with focus on epidemiology); continuous dynamical systems (with focus on biochemical kinetics and pharmacokinetics); and systems biology (with focus on genetic through organism levels). Students are using computer algebra software, and online modules are being developed for the different topics. Intellectual Merit. The material design, course design, pedagogy, and evaluation plan are informed by recent literature related to best educational practices. The course and curriculum materials are being evaluated by experts in mathematical biology. Broader Impacts. Several institutions, including a research university, a community college, and a four-year college, is committed to the project, and workshops and conference presentations are planned for dissemination of materials and assessment results.<br/><br/>"
