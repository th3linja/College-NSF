Through advances in science and technology and educational ventures to produce well-qualified professionals who utilize those advances effectively, the life sciences industries contribute significantly to the strength of the United States economy and to the health of its citizenry. The bi-state region of Kansas and Missouri, with the Kansas City metropolitan area serving as a hub, is experiencing robust growth in the life sciences industries, as a reported 21% increase in employment occurred across the 240 life science companies in the region from 2009 to 2012. In response to workforce needs and the continual innovations in science and technology, Kansas City Kansas Community College (KCKCC) will develop the Kansas City Kansas Biomanufacturing Training Laboratory (KCKBTL). The KCKBTL will provide educational opportunities that lead to employment in the local life sciences workforce to residents of communities served by the college. <br/><br/>The KCKBTL will establish educational pathways that lead from high schools through institutions of higher education and ultimately into professional careers in the life sciences. Educational partners in this collaborative endeavor include KCKCC, the Kansas City Kansas Public Schools and the University of Kansas Medical Center.  Project goals include: (1) working closely with representatives from the life sciences workforce to define and develop sequences of industry-validated courses that lead to a Certificate in Biomanufacturing or an Associate Degree in Bioscience to prepare KCKCC students for multiple entry points into careers in the local industry and (2) providing professional development opportunities for high school science teachers and community college faculty members in topical areas that facilitate technician education in the life sciences. KCKCC students will be placed into internships at local companies and in academic research laboratories at the University of Kansas Medical Center. Methods to evaluate project success and its impact include stakeholder interviews and focus groups, along with collecting data that monitors student success in the technician education programs and employment statistics for program graduates."

The partnership is increasing the efficacy of science and math teaching by gaining an increased understanding of the needs of high school teachers through the creation of new needs-assessment tools for teacher professional development. Ten faculty members from KCKCC's Division of Engineering, Mathematics, and Sciences, representing the fields of biology, chemistry, engineering, environmental science, mathematics and the physical sciences, are serving as mentors to high school teachers. Community College faculty and teachers are working to increase teacher content knowledge, build knowledge of effective technology use in the curriculum and build skills for teachers to become more engaging to students in the areas of math and science.  This structured Higher education - K12 institutionalized partnership is providing insight into the professional development concerns of math and science high school teachers in urban schools that increase student achievement in the areas of math and science. The ATOMS partnership is joined by other local educational entities and community groups interested in STEM education."

The incorporation of new instrumentation in our laboratory enhances our chemistry curriculum through hands-on reinforcement of lecture material using state-of-the-art instrumentation.  This allows for the modernization of existing experiments (Bishop & Bishop, 1996; Wilcox & Wilcox, 1995) and the introduction of new experiments (Wilson, 1996 and Van Ripwyk, 1997 funded by NSF ILI grants DUE-9252116 and DUE-9350633, respectively). <br/><br/>The Physics, Biology, and Mortuary Sciences Departments utilize this equipment to analyze gases, serological samples, and other solids.  In addition, the forthcoming incorporation of a Kansas Bureau of Investigations (KBI) Satellite Facility at KCKCC (funded by Senate Bill 481) informs students about many of the uses of FT-IR spectroscopy in forensic science and criminology.<br/><br/>The majority of our students who take the chemistry courses affected by this instrumentation transfer to State of Kansas universities and four-year colleges.  The addition of this instrumentation in our courses allows our students to be as prepared as the students who take their first two years of chemistry courses from other institutions.<br/><br/>"
