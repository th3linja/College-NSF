Local industrial firms are supplying samples that can be used for analysis giving the students an opportunity to learn chemistry on items with which they are particularly familiar. One manufacturing plant is a circuit board plating plant and does extensive metal analysis and the other is involved in working with a Vermiculite used in animal feed. Both provide opportunities for interesting student involvement and a challenging opportunity for the students. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources."
