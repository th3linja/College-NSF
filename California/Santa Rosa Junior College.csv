This effort aims to improve the academic outcomes of low-income, academically talented STEM students by expanding the role that community college faculty play in advising and mentoring while pairing that role with financial support. Community college students will be provided with the high-touch, focused-faculty advising model, typically found at smaller private four-year institutions of higher education. Sixty low-income students majoring in Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Physics, Engineering, or Mathematics will be recruited, in three cohorts of twenty students over the grant life span. <br/><br/>Led by an interdisciplinary team of STEM faculty at Santa Rosa Junior College, the STEM MILES project will provide interventions that develop students' scientific self-efficacy, identity, motivation, and values that are known to promote successful transfer to four-year institutions or completion of degrees in the STEM fields. To reinforce their sense of belonging to the scientific community and encourage their perseverance in STEM academic pathways, the MILES scholars will enroll in an interdisciplinary course on Critical Thinking in the Sciences and participate in co-curricular faculty mentoring.  To enhance faculty-student collaborations within the STEM community, the scholars will participate in career exploration opportunities through networking, field trips, job shadowing events, career fairs, and internship opportunities. To foster scientific self-identity and self-efficacy, the students will select from a menu of professional development opportunities every semester, in order to gain experience with research, as well as build leadership and job skills.  The evaluation and assessment of this project will inform the transformative process from traditional STEM instruction to specialized instruction.  Formative assessment will track the experience of the scholars through the Program via end-of-semester checklists and surveys. The summative assessment will be done via questionnaires comparing students at the beginning versus the end of the program and the statistical analysis of student performance data against a baseline cohort.  The underperformance of traditionally disadvantaged groups in the STEM fields is a well-documented phenomenon, and this project holds promise for providing a model that counteracts that underperformance. The MILES Program adds curricular components, a comprehensive system of faculty advising, and encourages the STEM departments to track data related to the progress and completion of STEM-related student pathways. The results of formative and summative assessments will be of interest to the increasing number of community colleges that are redesigning their academic programs to provide coherent pathways leading to improved student graduation and transfer."

The investigators will incorporate student-centered teaching practices that increase student motivation and interest in learning and improve laboratory instruction in biology, chemistry, environmental science, geology, math, and physics. These improvements will leverage the CUREnet project, which was previously funded by the NSF, therefore increasing the impact of that investment. The project will improve instruction for non-science majors, increasing the scientific literacy of the general population. Because the college is a Hispanic-Serving institution, the project will also promote the broader participation of Hispanic students majoring in the sciences.  <br/><br/>The goals of this project are to shift from traditional, faculty-centered instruction to evidence-based, student-centered practices. The focus on courses that serve both STEM majors and non-STEM majors will broaden the STEM workforce and improve STEM literacy for all students. Project evaluation will examine the development of students' scientific self-identity and impacts on students' academic performance. This project will generate evidence regarding the impacts on student learning due to a research-rich, student-centered, problem-based learning STEM curriculum; how students develop scientific self-identity; the factors that convince non-STEM students to switch to STEM majors; and how faculty members from multiple disciplines form a cohesive professional learning community that collaborates productively at a Hispanic-serving community college."

High school students are introduced to sustainable agriculture through outreach and a summer academy program where they receive dual credit and also credit by examination (CBE) for selected high school courses. For students enrolled in SA programs at SRJC, improving retention and completion rates are accomplished through enhanced advising, modifications to curriculum, increased course offerings and the development of internship opportunities. The project establishes improved articulation of SA courses with CA's state-supported four-year institutions such as UC-Davis, UC-Santa Cruz, Chico State and Fresno State to allow more students to pursue and complete four-year degrees in SA. Students benefit from experiential ""farm to table"" learning at SRJC's 365 acre Shone Farm. Students also learn business and marketing aspects that are critical to a successful SA operation through internships and student enterprise projects. Potential benefits of the project include improved stewardship of the land and natural resources, decreased use of chemicals, healthier food supplies, and new ways to support small and medium farms."

The instrument would be used mainly in the organic chemistry course in hands-on mode to do new experiments involving chemical shift reagents, spin-spin decoupling, and identification of laboratory products from micro-scale experiments. Investigative activities of students will be made possible by the instrument."
