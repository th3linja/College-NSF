In light of an aging geoscience workforce that exhibits a lack of ethnic diversity when compared with other STEM fields, the geoscience community must develop new models of mentorship for pre-career and early career personnel to build and sustain the skills, diversity, and size of the workforce. Existing STEM retention and diversity programs have recognized access to field and professional experiences as critical to helping students identify as scientists, form networks, and gain important skills necessary for employment in a variety of public and private sectors. The goal of this project is to engage a diverse cohort of Environmental-STEM (ESTEM) track undergraduates at 4-year colleges and universities (4YCUs) and community colleges (2YCs) in hands-on, career-applicable experiences that will launch students into the geoscience workforce.<br/><br/>This project reimagines the traditional geology field course as a professional development experience to address the emergence of new ""environmental"" geoscience tracks at many 4YCUs.  Faculty from the University of San Francisco, Mount San Antonio College, and the College of the Atlantic are working with environmental geoscience professionals from academia, public agencies, consulting, and non-profit organizations to identify key geoscience career skills and develop a ""badge"" system to recognize mastery of these skills. A summer field course and post-field seminar provides participating undergraduate students with opportunities to engage with stakeholders, learn and practice skills in the pursuit of earning badges. Further, this program is demonstrating the potential uses of a new technology (digital badges) for student assessment. Badges create space for dialog between students, faculty, and stakeholders and are adaptable and accessible by all students, not just those able or apt to participate in a given program. Badges also enable transparent documentation of skill mastery for students and employers, providing a new way for students to understand and market the skills, competencies, concepts, and learning outcomes (SCCLs) gained through environmental geoscience courses. Assessments are being used to ensure alignment of stakeholder-identified skills, badges, and field curriculum, and address the efficacy of the program in student retention in the geoscience pipeline. With a new model of field course that targets environmental geoscience students, engages stakeholders in the field, and unites a diverse group of learners through institutional collaboration, this program serves as a model for geoscience professional development at the undergraduate level.  Lessons learned through this project are being made accessible to the wider community through webinars, workshops, and a project website."

Since research experiences may be limited at many two-year college campuses, students at these institutions would benefit from expanded opportunities to engage in authentic research experiences. Educating enough skilled technical workers who are prepared for advanced technology industries has become a national priority in the United States, and it is essential for the country to retain its global leadership in science and technology. Community and technical colleges play a vital role in meeting this demand, especially for preparing students who are well qualified to enter the technical workforce or transfer to a four-year university to earn STEM baccalaureate degrees. An efficient and rapid way to produce the STEM professionals that the nation needs would be to increase community college student persistence in STEM fields. This project proposes to achieve that goal by providing more undergraduate research experiences to community college students.  The research experiences are expected to help students gain deeper STEM knowledge and skills, to increase their academic success, and to enable them to develop the highly valued professional skills needed to enter the STEM technical workforce.<br/><br/>The project will build on three distinct goals: (1) providing authentic undergraduate research experiences to a large number of STEM students to help strengthen their interest in STEM careers and gain professional skills that are critically important in the technical workplace;  (2) modifying an assessment tool, EvaluateUR, for use in shorter (8-week) summer research experiences; and (3) implementing EvaluateUR to assess the intellectual growth and development in the students? disciplinary and professional skills acquired through participating in the undergraduate research experiences. The project is aligned with the goals of the Advanced Technological Education program and leverages the vast research facilities and resources at the University of California, Irvine, together with the technical resources and support for modifying and implementing EvaluateUR available through SUNY-Buffalo State and the Science Education Resource Center at Carleton College. Four cohorts of 20 STEM students will be recruited and engaged in an undergraduate research experience. Student and faculty mentors will be assessed using the modified EvaluateUR tool. This tool has been shown to measure a broad range of desirable outcomes that include both content knowledge and the outcomes that are critically important in the workplace, including communication skills, ability to solve obstacles, problem solving skills and critical thinking.  The project will work to ensure educational equity through activities that support the recruitment of women, veterans, first-time college students, racial and ethnic minorities; these groups represent an important, talented STEM pool for growing the nation's technological workforce. The project outcomes will be published through a dedicated website, presentations at local and regional conferences, including the ATE Principal Investigators Conference, the American Association of Community Colleges annual convention, and the Council on Undergraduate Research Conference. The lessons learned while implementing this project will likely be of interest to all community colleges and other academic institutions with an interest in engaging students in similar research experiences. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although these concepts have been covered at several levels of sophistication in various chemistry courses, they have not been well understood by the majority of students.  The problem that students have had with understanding these concepts arises from the difficult task of visualizing these concepts in the microscopic world of atoms and molecules.  Recent advances in molecular modeling, computational chemistry, and 3-D visualization software provide an exciting opportunity to more effectively teach these critical concepts in an innovative way. These advances, coupled with relatively powerful and affordable computer workstations, and superb graphic software and hardware, make this approach viable.    For years, molecular modeling has played a significant role in chemical and pharmaceutical designs in both industry and graduate-level researah.  Now is the time to incorporate molecular modeling into the undergraduate curriculum to help students better comprehend critical structural concepts.  To achieve this goal, the department is purchasing 14 computers and one SGI workstation, which can be interconnected and can support SPARTAN software.  This new facility is enabling chemistry faculty to teach molecular modeling and computational chemistry to students in a meaningful way, and it is enabling students to visualize a number of fundamental microscopic concepts that are important to the macroscopic properties of materials."

Curricular development emphasizes societally relevant modules (e.g., earthquake and landslide hazards, water resources),  which feature authentic data from such geodetic sources as land-based global positioning systems (GPS), satellite-based gravity and topographic measurements with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution, and aerial light-detection-and-ranging (LiDAR) surveys. Modules developed for both introductory and advanced geoscience courses are undergoing rigorous assessment and revision at a range of institutions. Dissemination to the broader geoscience-education community includes workshops, webinars and web-accessible modules and a developer's manual.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project lies in its compelling rationale for the need of high-quality educational materials, currently not available in textbooks or laboratory manuals, which merge recent geodesy-related advances and insights with societally relevant cases. The project team leverages the diverse expertise of the partnering institutions and organizations in geodesy content, in research-informed pedagogy and assessment, and in effective approaches to dissemination. Broader impacts include the diverse range of students and institutions involved, ensuring both direct benefits during materials development and high potential for widespread adoption, aided by proactive and effective dissemination pathways. Incorporation of geodesy principles and methods in the undergraduate curriculum also enhances quantitative skills, aids workforce development in this rapidly growing area, and enhances basic earth-science literacy."

Several NMR experiments are adapted from recent chemical education literature. Several expanded experiments in the Organic laboratory curriculum also utilize the FT-NMR. General chemistry students use 1H and proton-decoupled 13C NMR in several introductory experiments involving compound identification. Organic chemistry students use 1H, 13C, DEPT and 2D-NMR techniques (COSY and HETCOR) in structure determination and product identification in organic syntheses. A prominent feature of the proposed curriculum is the extensive incorporation of molecular modeling in the experiments to connect computational experiments to experimental results. Additional components are designed to: (1) develop a three-week NMR workshop for local high school teachers and students to promote interest in science, and (2) involve a number of freshman and sophomore science majors in research collaboration with neighboring four-year institutions. A comprehensive evaluation plan is designed to assess the overall impact of the project, evaluate its specific pedagogical goals and objectives, and measure student learning as the adapted experiments are implemented in the curriculum. As a result of this project, students completing the new curriculum will be well prepared for either technical employment or upper-level laboratories and research after transferring to four-year institutions."
