TS3P is based on an existing, highly successful partnership between Cerritos College and California State University-Long Beach (CSULB) that prepares future elementary school teachers through a streamlined program that allows the completion of a baccalaureate degree, student teaching, and a multiple subject teaching credential in just five years. TS3P builds on this foundation by creating a secondary school teacher development program. The need for such a program is particularly acute given the recent changes in state credentialing and an increased emphasis on technological literacy, as well as the ongoing dearth of mathematics and science-qualified teachers in the high school classrooms of our high-poverty, multicultural service area. Qualified mathematics and science teachers are vital to providing expanded educational opportunities not only within the classroom, but also as a necessary element in preparing students adequately for today's technically sophisticated workplace. <br/><br/>The overall project goal is to increase the number of secondary school teachers who have single subject credentials in mathematics or the sciences. To accomplish this goal, seven objectives are being implemented: 1) recruitment; 2) curriculum development, piloting, and pathway development; 3) fieldwork; 4) mentoring; 5) counseling and advising; 6) professional development; and 7) university transfer. Evaluation activities support this project's goal of educational reform. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project lies in its creation of a new model for secondary teacher development, one that creates a seamless educational experience for prospective high school math and science teachers transitioning from a two-year to a four-year institution without ""transfer shock."" This collaboration is developing a model of intersegmental articulation to benefit students and meet the needs for qualified math and science teachers in regional high schools. This model has broader impacts beyond merely meeting an identified regional need. Other institutions nationwide will benefit from the experience of these two institutions and will be able to adopt the model piloted in this proposed project to their own needs and own developing partnerships. <br/>"

California's teacher shortage is acute in Southern California, where it has especially affected high-poverty, high-minority K-12 districts. These districts need many more, highly qualified STEM teachers with STEM degrees and teaching credentials, particularly in high schools.  These classrooms also face a widening gap between faculty and student demographics, which can affect student learning and success. This project will provide undergraduates with paid internships at an informal science institution, the Columbia Memorial Space Center.  Before and during their internship, the students will be mentored by college STEM faculty who have completed professional development to help them hone their mentoring skills.  These activities are designed to address two regional needs: 1) recruiting and retaining students from HSIs who are on track to achieve a STEM degree and a STEM secondary single-subject teaching credential; and 2) broadening participation in STEM teaching and the STEM workforce.  Teachers often report that they were drawn to the teaching profession by a positive teaching experience. Thus, this project intends to provide students with such an experience.  After training at the College, student interns will have teaching experiences that include facilitating field trips and other learning experiences at the Columbia Memorial Space Center.  Because at least 70% of the students at the college are Hispanic, most students participating in the internship will also be Hispanic.  The expected project deliverables include outreach to at least 3,000 K-12 students, paid internships for up to 60 undergraduate interns, and improved mentoring skills in participating faculty.<br/><br/>The project research plan is designed to advance understanding of the effectiveness of paid internships in informal STEM education settings to attract students (particularly Hispanic students) into secondary-STEM teaching professions. The project will address three research questions: 1) To what extent do the different elements of the project (recruitment, mentors, internship, etc.) contribute to community college students? pursuit of STEM degrees and students? perception of secondary school teaching as a viable STEM-related career? 2) In what ways does the project contribute to the development of students? identity as both a STEM learner and STEM teacher? 3) To what extent do students? experiences as informal science educators during the internship support the development of effective practices for science teaching and communication? The project will use a mixed methods approach, employing research tools that include focus groups, surveys, academic records, and validated research instruments. By the end of its three-year funding period, the program expects to achieve a 30% (18 student) increase in the College?s secondary teacher preparation pathway and that these students will be both pursuing STEM degrees and intending to receive a single-subject teaching credential in a STEM discipline.  The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The activities being provided by this project are an adaptation of innovative teaching strategies and activities from several institutions, most notably CSU Fullerton, Hampshire College and Butler University. Students are being introduced to basic physiological experimental procedures using the requested equipment. Collaborative student groups are then being presented with experimental questions to which they must discover the answers. With guidance from the instructor, student groups are forming a testable hypothesis, designing the experiment and analyzing the data. These activities are building the necessary skills for students in the advanced physiology labs to conduct independent projects. Written lab reports and group presentations, are incorporated into the labs. This new approach is promoting the development of critical and analytical thinking, increasing student comprehension of physiological concepts, and introducing students to the usefulness of computers as biological and analytical tools.  Expected outcomes include: summative evaluations to measure student learning in the targeted courses; the development of a web page to disseminate the developed activities and procedures; and a workshop to promote inquiry-based learning in two year colleges. The project is impacting approximately 350 students each year and emphasizes two DUE themes: diversity and integration of technology to improve learning.<br/><br/>"
