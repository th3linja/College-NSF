These experiments, which are being incorporated into seven existing courses (General Chemistry I and II, Organic Chemistry I and II, Physical Chemistry I and II and Biochemistry I) as well as a new spectroscopy course, focus on the use of NMR spectroscopy to answer questions, solve problems, or discover new concepts. These types of inquiry-based activities have been shown to improve student learning and increase student interest in and enthusiasm for the study of science.<br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>Students are being introduced to 13C NMR spectroscopy by using a new 90 MHz Anasazi NMR spectrometer in general chemistry in an experiment that examines the concept of isomers and another where they investigate the structure of aspirin. Students are learning 1H and 13C NMR in organic chemistry and are using both 1H and 13C NMR in experiments to identify reaction products and study reaction mechanisms. They also are introduced to two dimensional NMR through a HETCOR experiment. Students in the new spectroscopy course use various NMR experiments and techniques including two dimensional NMR to determine the structures of organic and inorganic unknowns. They also visit the NMR and mass spectrometry laboratories at the University of South Carolina to as part of this course.  Students in the biochemistry course use 19F NMR to study enzyme kinetics, and in physical chemistry students use NMR spectroscopy to study reaction kinetics, determine equilibrium constants and to probe spin relaxation effects. With the aid of a local high school teacher, the experiments for general chemistry are being adapted for a high school audience, and high school chemistry classes are invited to Columbia College to carry out these experiments.<br/>An Advisory Panel that consists of three faculty members from other predominately<br/>undergraduate institutions in South Carolina and the Columbia College's Director of Assessment are helping to evaluate this project. Student learning outcomes have been established for each class in which new discovery-based experiments are being introduced.<br/>Broader Impact<br/>Through this project more than 70 women science majors (44% minority) a year are being<br/>exposed to a series of discovery-based labs and are having hand-on experience with the<br/>instrumentation used most routinely for structure determination in modern chemistry laboratories. These students also are developing skills that are enabling them to carry out undergraduate research projects.  Through this endeavor, students and faculty at Columbia College are collaborating with faculty at a large research institution and at several other predominately undergraduate institutions within the state. The Columbia College faculty also are broadening their interactions with local high school teachers and students. Results of this project will be disseminated into the chemical education community through conferences and meetings, peer-reviewed journals and through the formation of a South Carolina Anasazi Instrument User's Group.<br/>"

Ten years ago, the curriculum was very traditional. Growing enrollments in the sciences and a new vision for the role of a women's college in the modern world led to a successful campaign to build a new science and mathematics facility. With a new physical space and an institutional commitment to mathematics and science, these departments are poised to expand their innovative teaching and curricular reform efforts. The entire campus is committed to integrating the historical strengths in liberal arts with the tradition of teaching innovation in science and mathematics. With this grant, the faculty at Columbia College have initiated a bold new plan of faculty development and curriculum reform to infuse scientific inquiry into the curriculum, thereby creating linkages between and among disciplines and realigning approaches to all disciplines using modern science and its modes of inquiry. <br/><br/>The program for institution-wide reform of undergraduate education consists of three phases: (1 ) a summer institute, designed for faculty in all disciplines, that will enable them to experience scientific modes of inquiry and scientific research; (2) the collaborative creation of two general education courses. (3) an outreach summer institute for teachers at local public schools and interested faculty in non-scientific disciplines. <br/><br/>One of the two general education courses will focus on distinct modes of inquiry and the similarities and differences with which the sciences, the social sciences, the fine arts and the humanities approach problem-solving. This course will instill in first-semester college students the process of making linkages between branches of thought. The other course will be an opportunity for non-science majors actually to do science. The course will serve as an introduction to the study of science and will culminate with a scientific research project designed to connect with each student's major field of study. Both discovery collaboratives will emphasize a problem-centered approach to learning, and we will utilize our working knowledge of collaborative learning and gender based learning to develop innovative learning components. <br/><br/>The outreach summer institute will allow us to build on strong relationships with local school districts and public school teachers. It will also provide important professional development opportunities for elementary and middle school teachers, as well as high school teachers and college faculty from our own campus and from other colleges in the state. The college will commit to continuing to offer the institute on an annual basis after the funding period ends."

The proposed laboratory will support the research of Dr. Kenneth Ilio<br/>(co-PI) on prostate development that he will be conducting with students taking Science Institute courses. In particular, he is devising a method to isolate stem cells, the most primitive cells in the adult prostate membranous tissue. A major component of this research is cell culture, particularly defining culture conditions that will shift<br/>differentiation of candidate primitive stem cells to a more differentiated adult cell. The long-term goal of this research is to establish both normal and transformed cell lines of specific lineages that are derived from the stem cells of the prostate. The differentiated cells that arise from stem cells could be valuable tools as cell culture models for the study of prostate normal and abnormal development, particularly cancer development.<br/> The cell culture lab complements existing laboratories in the Science<br/>Institute, namely (1) the Science Visualization and Communications Laboratory where students can produce 2-D and 3-D models of scientific concepts and processes, and (2) an analytical laboratory where students can perform and replicate sophisticated experiments similar to those used in forensic and environmental investigations. The proposed laboratory will service the cell culture needs of all the biology courses taught at the Science Institute. Students will gain hands-on exposure in and basic understanding of cell biology in both microscopic and molecular levels. In addition, acquisition of the cell culture laboratory will allow Chicago public school teachers in the Science Institute's network to conduct projects during the summer as well as during the academic year. These research projects will enhance the teachers' instructional methods and materials in their classrooms.<br/> The benefits of this curriculum to the general public are substantial by providing a strong science background to Columbia College's television, radio, journalism, education and other students, and to teachers in the Chicago public schools, the Science Institute is<br/>positively influencing the education of millions of people through these professionals. Providing these communication and education students with first-hand research experience will guarantee that an accurate and positive image of science will be communicated to the public, and will dramatically improve the public understanding of science. It is anticipated that the exposure of teachers to this proposed facility and<br/>to the creative methods of teaching developed by the Science Institute will increase the number of students seeking careers in the sciences. Project results will be reported in professional conferences and in scientific journals, in addition to the print and electronic media that regularly report on programs of the Science Institute."

To address this issue, this project will build statewide networks of college, middle school, and high school faculty who will offer workshops and provide continuing support during the academic year. <br/><br/>The networks will be set up in three different states (North Carolina, South Carolina, and Mississippi). College and university faculty will work directly with middle school and high school teachers in teaching and learning innovative and effective ways of introducing computing and computer programming, and in incorporating computational thinking into other disciplines. This project scales up a previous, successful collaborative project for students and teachers using the Alice 3D programming environment. The approach focuses on a strong core of fundamental programming concepts and problem-solving techniques in an object-oriented, interactive environment. The project's external evaluation will include the collection of qualitative and quantitative data on teacher instruction and students' enrollment and performance. <br/><br/>The project will train approximately 265 teachers directly, and provide support for master teachers to provide subsequent training for other teachers in their home districts. This project has the potential to increase the amount and effectiveness of instruction in object-oriented programming concepts and problem-solving to a large number of middle school and high school students. By training middle school and high school teachers in the proposed approach, and by providing support networks and building community, the project should be able to impact students throughout three states. Developed curricular materials will be stored in an online, searchable database to be freely available to all teachers. In making computing, computer science, programming, and computational thinking more attractive to middle school and high school students, the project team expects to encourage more students to major in STEM, and particularly computing, at the college level."

The Science Institute will partner with eight minority serving community based organizations and the Museum of Science and Industry, the Field Museum, and the Garfield Park Conservatory Alliance to develop and implement all aspects of the program. The goals of the program are two-fold. First, the project will develop and implement a high-quality STEM based afterschool program for under-represented youth in STEM. Second, the professional development and experience implementing the curriculum with youth in the local communities and within informal science education (ISE) institutions will extend and enrich the pre-service teachers' STEM content and pedagogical knowledge base and better prepare them to teach science in formal and informal settings.<br/><br/>Thirty teachers will receive specialized professional development through a seminar, course, and other support mechanisms in order to best support the implementation of the modules, while building their STEM content expertise, confidence, and pedagogical knowledge. Each module has a different STEM content focus: alternative energy (fall), the physics and mathematics of sound and music (winter), and environmental science (spring). At the end of each module, a culminating youth-led presentation will be held at one of the partnering Chicago museums. Youth will be encouraged to participate in all three modules. The formative evaluation will be conducted by the Co-Principal Investigators. Pre and post assessments, artifact reviews, and interviews will be used for the summative evaluation, which will be conducted by an external evaluator at the Illinois Institute of Technology. <br/><br/>The project deliverables include: (a) a teacher training program, (b) an after school curriculum, and (c) media tools - DVDs, website.

The larger impact of this project will be the development of a scalable model for bringing relevant STEM content and experiences to youth, their families, and non-science major pre-service teachers. As a result of this project, a cadre of pre-service teachers will have: (a) increased their STEM content knowledge, (b) gained experience presenting STEM content in informal settings, (c) learned effective approaches to deliver hands-on STEM content, and (d) learned to use museum and other ISE resources in their teaching. In fact, after the grant period nearly half of the teachers will continue to work at the centers as part-time instructors, fully supported by the partnering community centers."

A                     major component of this unique approach is the integration of                   science with the humanities and the arts.  This project will                    attempt to transfer that method of instruction to a program                     designed to improve the knowledge and teaching skills of                        middle school science teachers.  A series of workshops using                    this creative approach and lasting four weeks will be offered                   during three consecutive summers.  Under the ""umbrella"" theme                   of environmental science, the topics of physics, chemistry,                     geology and biology will be studied, through laboratory                         experiences, discussions, and lectures.  Teachers will                          demonstrate their mastery of the material by creating and                       presenting projects which incorporate their talents and                         interests.  The projects will be able to take the form of                       paintings, films, videos, dances, poems, photoessays,                           sculptures, drama or journalism.  During each afternoon                         teachers will reflect on the methods of instruction being                       used to teach them science during the workshop and plan ways                    to transfer such methodology to their own classrooms.

The PI and others                        have developed, and are developing, curriculum that                             integrates science and mathematics.  The interdisciplinary                      approach to the curriculum extends beyond the linkage of                        math and science, since the physical, chemical and                              biological sciences will also be integrated.  Methods                           developed to excite science learning in teachers and                            students include the use of art, plays, music, dance, etc.                      These approaches also enable teachers to make connections                       across the curriculum for the students and illustrate the                       everyday context of science and mathematics.

Previously this work had been carried out by Environmental Assessment students and by geoscience majors with related independent studies. The API 300 Micro Flow Auto Analyzer System with its simple flow through cell allows a sampling rate of 90-120 samples per hour, and the included software package allows fast, efficient analyses which are appropriate features for exposing both non-science and science majors to modern technology and field- based research. Majors are acquiring valuable experience in the standard techniques in this field. This equipment also makes it possible to offer multiple sections of Environmental Assessment (mainly non-majors) and Stressed Stream Analysis (majors). The auto analyzer increases the frequency of sampling and size of the sampling area, improves the research component in courses and the validity of results, and makes possible the addition of new test sites in the watershed, The department is equipped with computer technology that can be interfaced with the API Analyzer for rapid graphical displays."
