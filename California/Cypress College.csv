However, the broad applications of GIS and the rapid growth of the field have led to a lack of coordination and awareness among practitioners and educators.     Cypress College, a two-year, state funded community college, is providing GIS training to high school teachers, and community college and university faculty in five locations. These workshops are providing technical upgrading, facilitating communication, collaboration and cooperation, promoting creative teaching and fostering effective learning environments.      The two-year sequence of Summer Institutes, with sites around the nation, serves 120 faculty selected to develop their teaching skills and technological competencies."

Topics to be considered include: the use of spreadsheets and databases in the classroom; computer assisted construction of illustrations, maps, and graphs; use of US Geological Survey materials such as GLORIA, JEdI, National snow and ice data, and the Ocean Atlas; earthquake modelling and analysis; volcanology; and, hydrologic management. A field trip to Owens Valley for seismic analysis of the San Andreas Fault is also planned."
