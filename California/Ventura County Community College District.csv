This is being achieved by adopting a workshop approach to teaching physics using enhanced microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) tools. The time students traditionally spend listening passively to lectures is replaced by direct, peer-group collaborative enquiry in a laboratory environment. Workshop physics uses integrated computer tools, including MBL, in mechanics and other areas of the curriculum. Enhanced use is made of dynamic spreadsheets and graphs for data analysis. An emphasis is placed on using these tools for modeling. The use of digital video analysis is also being used in the laboratory setting. Workshop physics provides a more supportive learning environment for students and a more supportive atmosphere for traditionally at-risk students such as those in Ventura's large Hispanic population. In addition, the MBL equipment and techniques from Workshop Physics will be introduced into the physical science course being developed for preservice teachers."

The mathematics faculty recognizes the need to utilize a computer algebra system in these courses so that students spend less time manipulating symbols and more time clarifying and visualizing mathematical principles. The center is serving as a classroom for weekly precalculus-calculus sessions. It is also serving as the location of weekly supplementary courses for precalculus-calculus enrichment. Finally, it is available to students outside of class for completing homework assignments and for attempting to find answers to their own independent questions. Students are improving their communication skills as they work together in the laboratory/classroom setting and as they integrate prose and mathematical output into their assignments. ***"

Specific new experiments from molecular biology and biochemistry are being added to the Biochemistry, Biology, Physiology, Anatomy/Physiology, Marine Biology and Microbiology courses at Ventura College. These lab course revisions will serve to better prepare students for transfer and high-tech vocations by providing varied contemporary problem-solving experiences, using modern techniques in molecular bioscience. Improved preparation for those entering the biotechnology training program, and transfer programs results from an advisory collaboration with the UCSB Math/Sciences Division. The addition of DNA isolation and characterization, restriction enzyme analysis, cloning prokaryotic vectors, mitochondria and chloroplast isolation and measurement, bacterial contamination spectroflurometic asssays, and analysis of protein and aromatic bioproducts, represent significant lab experience revisions. The equipment that will be needed includes chromatography, electrophoresis, spectroflurometer, UV spectrometer, gas chromatogram (upgrade), and metabolic oxygen sensors (the associated restriction enzymes and reagents will be provided by a local biotechnology company). The new Science building State Equipment Fund has been cut by more than 40%, making it impossible to offer these experiences without outside funding. This project will provide the matching funds needed to purchase the equipment. Each year, over 1,600 students at the college enroll in these courses. Funding of this project will provide students with: 1. Comprehensive problem-solving activities in traditional classes: 2. Improved activities in majors and non-majors classes; 3. Opportunities for individual students to perform individualized research in special courses with equipment; 4. Increased hands-on learning meaningful to transfer requ irements."

This is being achieved through major revisions and changes in the lab experiences of students who enroll in biology labs and completion of the biotechnology specialization program, permitting many hands-on explorations into molecular biology in the laboratory. This project involves a 2-year college, a 4-year university, and a biotech industry, through a consortium effort to identify and teach appropriate lab exercises that give students hands-on experience with the problem-solving methods used in biotechnology. These exercises are initially being integrated into the biotechnology lab course and the biology majors lab course. The biotechnology lab is part of a tech prep program linked to local high schools and to a transfer program. In addition, the equipment can be integrated into a training course for high school science teachers. The individuals primarily affected are biology majors and those preparing for careers in biotechnology, research, medicine, and teaching. The new equipment is fundamental to the training of the 35,000 to 100,000 biotechnicians and scientists who will be needed in the next decade. This instrumentation funding provides students with a comprehensive biotechnology lab program; improved instrumentation in majors and nonmajors biology lab courses; increased hands-on learning in a collaborative-learning atmosphere; state-of-the-art training (for teachers) in biotechnology lab skills; and expanded independent student research opportunities."

It is important that our laboratory exercises reflect the diversity of modern biology. Also, exercise are being developed that will be incorporated into a ""soft manual"" and made available to instructors at other schools. Circulation of a soft laboratory manual will allow instructors to tailor their curriculum to fit their individual needs and resources."

Students principally affected will be majors in physics, engineering, mathematics, electro-optics and the biological sciences. The equipment proposed for purchase consists of six student gamma ray multi-channel analyzer stations. Each station, which typically will accommodate two students, has an IBM compatible Intel 80286 based microcomputer and plotter interfaced with a multi-channel analyzer board. A scintillation detector and amplifier detects gamma radiation from a number of sources, enabling the students to perform experiments in which isotopes are identified, absorption coefficients are measured and half-lifes determined. The microcomputers purchased under this proposal will also be used to interface with other experiments in the laboratory and to run related software packages. Moorpark College will match the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds."

The project uses 18 IBM compatible multimedia computers plus one file server equipped with Internet and intranet networking hardware and software in the chemistry laboratory. The computer network is available to students through connections on and off campus for consulting with other students around the world, visualizing molecular models and mechanism animations, and researching chemical data bases for answers to their independent questions. Analog to digital converters for each computer allow for experimental data to be collected and analyzed in real time. Students improve their chemistry and communication skills as they collaborate in the laboratory setting and as they integrate chemical research, prose, and laboratory investigations into their assignments."
