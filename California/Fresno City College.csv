It will support the success of at least thirty low-income, high-achieving STEM undergraduate students with demonstrated financial need at Fresno City College, a two-year institution. Specifically, the project will provide two-year scholarships to five cohorts of students who are pursuing an associate's degree or certificate in engineering at Fresno City College. At least thirty students will be supported at Fresno City College, two of whom will receive an additional two-year scholarship to complete a bachelor's degree in engineering at California State-Fresno.  At Fresno City College, the Scholars will participate in program orientation at the beginning of each fall semester, pursue a transfer pathway curriculum designed to transition students to a four-year university engineering program, attend bi-weekly seminar events and monthly meetings with faculty mentors and peer mentors, serve as peer mentors for succeeding cohorts of Scholars, and participate in undergraduate research projects in collaboration with California State-Fresno. Fresno City College is a Hispanic-serving institution and recruiting will focus on women and students with disabilities, thus increasing the potential of the project to broaden participation in engineering. <br/><br/><br/>The goal of the project is to increase degree completion of low-income, high-achieving engineering undergraduates. The project includes a research plan to determine factors that influence student identity and sense of belonging. The researchers will test the hypothesis that engaging Fresno City College students in a collaborative, cohort experience will support students' movement from the periphery of learning to the center of a community in which learning is a collective experience guided by community membership. This project has the potential to create new knowledge about how the socio-cultural context of students from an area of concentrated poverty, such as Fresno, experience community and develop a STEM identity.  This project is funded by the NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income, academically high-achieving students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future scientists, engineers, and technicians, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently there are about 1,150 described species, with new ones being discovered annually. They have sausage-shaped bodies, with 8 legs ending in long claws. Water bears are unique because they can enter a state of 'suspended life' called cryptobiosis as their habitat dries out. In this stage, they can tolerate extreme conditions of cold, heat, vacuum, and pressure. Water bears may remain in this condition for many years until moisture returns allowing them to continue on with their lives. For a long time few scientists studied tardigrades because they were thought to have little economic or health value that were important to humans. However, their ability to suspend life is now being studied as a way to extend the 'shelf life' of organs harvested for transplant. It has also been discovered that in this suspended state water bears may be dispersed by wind carrying plant disease-causing bacteria, and that as a result they may be responsible for the spread of some crop diseases. The medical and industrial applications of this biology plus the disease issues make it critical to understand the global distribution of water bear species and to develop an up-to-date taxonomic framework to facilitate this work. <br/><br/>Water bear research necessarily starts with museum collections. The largest North American collection is housed in the Bohart Museum of Entomology. Most of this 35,000 slide collection was acquired in the 1960-70s, and was prepared according to the best practices of the time. Unfortunately, best practices of the time meant using non-archival mounting media, which degrades over time. As a result the specimens are rapidly deteriorating. In addition, the taxonomy of the specimens has not been updated since the 1970's and they have not been databased. To address these issues, this project seeks to stabilize, repair and restore the specimens mounting them in archival quality media, image each specimen and upload the images and associated metadata on-line and integrate all data with iDigBio. The project will also train undergraduates at Fresno City College and UC Davis in the processes of preparation, repair, documentation, and data entry of large-scale collections. Initially, type and voucher specimens will be remounted - after the process has been perfected with duplicate specimens of non-type material - following lessons learned during a similar project on another group of arthropods, parasitoid wasps. Following this initial phase all other non-type specimens will be addressed. All data resulting from this project will be posted on line at the Bohart Museum website, http://bohart.ucdavis.edu/ and shared with IDigBio, https://www.idigbio.org/, ensuring accessibility to researchers and educators. Additional information about the Bohart Museum and its outreach activities is available at http://bohart.ucdavis.edu/."

The teams will conduct a biotic survey of North America by collecting tardigrades at the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites. Student researchers will be trained to collect, identify, sequence, and report on tardigrades. Their results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and available over the internet on the Tardigrade Reference Center (TRC) at the Academy of Natural Sciences with keys, descriptions, images, DNA sequences, and distribution maps.<br/><br/>The project will discover new species, expand the continental diversity, and link DNA sequences to voucher specimens in order to ascertain species associations, distributional patterns, and genetic variation of the tardigrades.  The TRC will target scientists, educators and hobbyists who use the Internet to find data, facts, and teaching activities. The project models the collaboration between the undergraduate, research, and museum communities. It also fosters communication among specialists, and demonstrates the blending of morphological and molecular approaches to species identification.  The project will expose many students to scientific inquiry such that they will be prepared for careers in science, education, and government.<br/>"
