GIS combines cartography, spatial analysis, and data management to support research and inform decision-making. Computer programmers or database administrators need GIS expertise to maintain or program databases containing geographic information. Mapping technicians apply GIS concepts when creating maps and charts. GIS is also used in city planning, developing marketing strategies, addressing public health concerns, and conducting geographic research. The use of GIS in many fields opens new employment options for students. Despite these employment needs, only four GIS certificates were awarded in the South-Central Coast Region of California between 2012-2015, all by a single community college that is 200 miles from San Luis Obispo, where Cuesta College is located. Since adequate GIS training is not currently available in the region served by Cuesta College, this project aims to meet the high-demand workforce needs across multiple industry sectors for Geographic Information System (GIS) Technicians.<br/><br/>This project establishes a GIS Analyst certificate at Cuesta College, a Hispanic-Serving Institution. Activities include outreach, and project-based and work-based learning designed to motivate more students to enroll in specialized GIS courses.  This increased enrollment is expected to increase the number of students, particularly Hispanic students, who earn a GIS Analyst certificate. The certificate will be part of the Earth and Ocean Science program but may appeal to students who seek to add GIS skills to other degrees, such as engineering or computer information systems.  Through seminars related to use of GIS in these and other fields, the project aims to engage faculty from different fields in the GIS project. The GIS Analyst certificate is also expected to appeal to workers who need to learn GIS skills to advance in their careers or to become competitive for a new job. The GIS Analyst certificate requires the addition of three new courses, which will be based on models developed by the GeoTech Center with funding from the National Science Foundation. Regional employers will contribute to the development of the curriculum and provide work experiences for students. Students enrolled in GIS courses will have the opportunity to attend the Environmental Systems Research Institute Users Conference, earn industry-recognized credentials, and display their projects at a local GIS event. By June 2021, the project aims to enroll forty students in GIS courses and projects that ten or more students will earn the GIS Analyst certificate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studies focused on students from historically underrepresented groups show that participation in undergraduate research experiences improves their persistence in STEM and helps to validate their identity as scientists. Cuesta College, a two-year institution, will provide undergraduate research experiences in multiple STEM disciplines.  As suggested by previous research, it is expected that participating in undergraduate research will increase student engagement, improve their problem-solving skills, increase retention, and improve their success after college. A multi-disciplinary Faculty Inquiry Group will identify best practices and promote the value of undergraduate research to faculty and students.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to create a culture of undergraduate research involving multiple STEM disciplines to increase student engagement and better prepare students to succeed. The project will involve faculty from biology, engineering, astronomy, chemistry, and math, who will incorporate course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) into their courses. A Faculty Inquiry Group will build a knowledge base about how to offer effective undergraduate research experiences and will use that information to recruit other college faculty to incorporate CUREs into their courses. This core group of interdisciplinary faculty innovators will develop and test research experiences using different settings, modes, and methods. A successful CURE in astronomy will serve as a model to other disciplines and faculty involved in the astronomy CURE will assist CURE-developers in other disciplines. Economics will join the team to connect the project to the social sciences. Measures of student success will include scientific knowledge, understanding of research practices, and sense of belonging to the discipline. The project will provide professional development opportunities to all faculty to share knowledge about effective CURES and to encourage participation. The Faculty will be trained to mentor student researchers and to encourage them to publish or present their results.  College administration will address policies and procedures, such as articulation agreements and faculty workload, to remove barriers to the implementation of undergraduate research experiences. The concept of a robust, college-wide undergraduate research program at a two-year institution is innovative.  The project will monitor changes in faculty perceptions and attitudes about undergraduate research experiences and document challenges and benefits of implementing CUREs, which may include affects on faculty workload, advancement, and job satisfaction. Results of this project can provide insights about the capacity of community colleges to implement and expand CUREs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional engineering technology  education will not be adequate to prepare students for occupations in the high  performance workplace of the future. Community colleges can play a major role in eliminating this shortage and respond to future needs, but the cost of advanced engineering  technology programs limits the ability of any one college to effectively  meet the demand. Links to industry will help colleges keep pace with rapid changes in  technology.  The California Regional Consortium for Engineering Advances in Technological Education (CREATE) is a joint effort of seven  community colleges and over 70 engineering technology employers. Through this project, the Consortium has developed two and three year programs which all  begin with a common core curriculum in engineering technology. Each campus then offer two to five advanced technological specialties. Students from any one participating college will be able to transfer to any other college in the Consortium.  This unique regional approach allows the CREATE Consortium to:  <br/>(a) Reinvent science, mathematics, engineering, and technology  (SMET) curricula.  <br/>(b) Serve the needs of all students, including low income, underrepresented, and those who previously would not have considered engineering  technology.  (c) Grow with industry and meet future needs of the high performance  workplace. <br/>(d) Provide upgrade training to current industry employees.  <br/>(e) Enhance the status of, and strengthen, engineering technology  education. (f) Nurture new teaching methodologies in the classroom and laboratory."
