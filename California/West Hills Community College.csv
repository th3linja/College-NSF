Because of this great need, the Welding Distance Community Outreach (WELDCO) program at West Hills Community College is designed to meet the needs for a growing sector of advanced welding technicians on the West Side of the California impoverished Central Valley. The program seeks to transport and make mobile a successful, face-to-face, welding program and offer it in geographically isolated areas within the service area of the college where career and technical education (CTE) has been historically very limited. Cultural changes will occur within the regional community as children of first-generation immigrants attain post-secondary education and gainful employment, thus creating a positive generational learning outcome. Further benefits will accrue to the region as adult learners, those already employed seeking to improve job skills, and the unemployed capitalize on the accessibility of this education program. The project will impact both the state and the nation as this education paradigm is shared with other community colleges and organizations for improving employer partnerships and growth. A robust project evaluation will study the impact of this project on business and industry and on the students and workers involved. <br/><br/>WELDCO is a cohort-specific curriculum design which includes variable integration of e-learning, Virtual Reality (VR) welding technology, and traditional training as a means of engaging nontraditional students. Formative and summative assessments will be employed to assess curriculum performance and modifications needed. The package takes full advantage of California legislative mandates and state funding for education programs (including high school pathways and post-secondary education) to enhance the impact on education and subsequent employment in the region. Students will benefit from the expanded internship opportunities and employer collaborations to help create a regional impact. This project focuses on 3 objectives: (a) development of a blended welding curriculum  to integrate e-learning, VR instruction, and traditional classroom instruction that will lead to American Welding Society (AWS) certification; (b) optimization of course delivery to maximize efficiency, effectiveness, and engagement by addressing student cognitive preferences and learning styles; and (c) implementation of population specific recruitment to include Hispanic, minority, and female students."

Goals include improving educational opportunities for students, increasing retention of scholarship students to degree achievement, improving student support programs for scholarship participants, and increasing the numbers of well-educated and skilled employees in technical areas of national need.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Scholarships are being awarded to 25 students each semester in STEM disciplines. The goals are (a) 75% of ACCESS Scholars maintain or exceed a 2.6 grade point average (GPA); (b) 70% of ACCESS Scholars persist until associate degree achievement; and (c) 100% of students are provided transfer or job placement assistance. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: As the sole accredited provider of postsecondary education in a large service area, the mission of the college is to provide accessible higher education opportunities to community residents. By offering scholarships to academically talented, financially needy students majoring in STEM disciplines, the college is meeting the needs of both the agricultural industries in the district and students. Over 70% of the students attending the college are first-generation who have had little exposure to scientific career opportunities. About 40% of the students are Hispanic and a great number of these students come from families where the parents are migrant workers or field laborers. Recruitment of these students into scientific careers not only impacts their future, but it also increases the scientific awareness of friends and family members in their communities. The broader impact resulting from improved STEM education and STEM scholarships conveys the message that exciting, lucrative careers exist in the sciences and that agricultural careers are not limited to field work."

Over its 5-year duration, this project will fund 200 scholarships to at least 50 students who are pursuing associate's degrees in Biology, Chemistry, Engineering, Geology, Mathematics or Physics.  Each student will receive up to four semesters of scholarship support.  The project aims to increase student enrollment and persistence in STEM fields by supplementing scholarships with comprehensive support services, including mentoring, supplemental instruction, enhanced academic and career counseling, and enrichment opportunities.  The project will implement a comprehensive data collection mechanism to document and disseminate best practices.  Because WHCC has a high population of underrepresented students, this project has the potential to broaden participation in STEM fields and advance knowledge of the relationship between student support services and retention and graduation of students underrepresented in STEM degree programs.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income high achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need.  Three objectives guide this project. First, to increase the recruitment, retention, student success, and graduation (or transfer to four year programs) of eligible students pursuing associate degrees. Second, to adapt, develop, implement, and study evidence-based practices that support student success. Third, to contribute to the documentation and dissemination of evidence-based curricular and co-curricular activities for students underrepresented in STEM fields of study. This project will use qualitative and quantitative data analysis to study STEM identify formation and the impact of the program on student success by ethnicity, race, gender and disability status. An external evaluator will provide formative and summative feedback, and the project team will disseminate results at national conferences.  This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields.  It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
