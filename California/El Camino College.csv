The college seeks new methods, curriculum, and teaching strategies to retain and prepare students for transfer to four-year institutions. The approach the Departments of Astronomy, Chemistry, Mathematics, Earth and Computer Sciences in this project is to provide a greater amount of active learning through the use of ""hands on"" computer simulations of projects that previously were lecture only topics. The subject matter chosen for active learning are abstract topics and three dimensional presentations that require some ""visualization"". Greater ""visualization"" is now possible through the use of computers using complex graphical, animation, and simulation programs that allow for the examination and presentation of math and science topics in ways that never before existed. By introducing ""visualization"" in a variety of courses and assignments, the faculty believe that greater understanding, appreciation, and retention of course material will occur. Each of the five departments have described, and in some cases pilot tested, projects and subject matter for ""visualization"". The departments will share a single multi-disciplinary, multimedia computer laboratory with both Macintosh and IBM capability. The goal is to increase the number of students completing their bachelor degrees within the next five years. Since two thirds of all El Camino students are minority students, a greater transfer and graduation rate of El Camino students will add to the pool of minority mathematicians and scientists. Evaluation of retention and comparison of test score data will be examined. Significant results will be published in professional journals as well as presentations to regional professional organizations."

Qualified students are eligible to receive scholarships for two years of academic study at the college and a transfer scholarship upon transferring to a four-year university in a STEM field. <br/><br/>The project is achieving the following objectives: <br/>1. Providing scholarships to at least 58 academically talented, financially disadvantaged STEM students, including those from underrepresented groups. <br/>2. Providing academic support to scholarship recipients so that at least 80% persist to transfer with a grade point average of 3.0 or higher. <br/>3. Providing counseling support to scholarship recipients so that at least 80% complete transfer requirements, apply, and are accepted as transfer students to a four-year institution. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project is increasing the academic success of students through financial support, enhancement of student engagement with faculty, and exposure to their chosen field. It is strongly supported by the statewide Mathematics Engineering Science Achievement (MESA) program and by the college through the Divisions of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Financial Aid, the President, and the Board of Trustees. STEM faculty act as mentors for scholarship recipients to help optimize their educational experience, refine their interests, and assist them with socialization into a disciplinary culture. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The project is increasing the enrollment of students from traditionally underrepresented groups in the STEM fields at the college. It is also improving their retention and success and increasing the number of students who transfer to four-year universities as STEM majors. Strategies include the promotion of self-efficacy in students, independent learning, and early exposure to research and disciplinary culture. Obtaining a degree in a STEM field prepares students for rewarding high-wage employment in areas of local and national need benefiting both individual students, and local and national economy. Best practices and lessons learned are being documented and shared with other institutions."
