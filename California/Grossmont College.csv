The laboratory systems will be tied to the existing department and campus Novell network by upgraded NetWare 3.11 software and a dedicated 486 file server. Experiments will be designed to enhance discovery exercises to enable students to investigate phenomena and perform calculations rapidly and transparently to look for trends and inconsistencies in experimental data to shift the focus to one of exploration. The emphasis of the laboratory will be to improve laboratory skills, learn chemical concepts, design experimental procedures, experiment like a scientist, and produce meaningful results and reports. ***y"

The project incorporates Power Macintosh computers connected to MacLab 2- and 4-channel signal interfaces for data collection, data analysis, and report writing into the structural design of the experimental methods of six laboratories. Eight student workstations are being developed in one of the four teaching laboratories. Each station includes a Macintosh computer connected to a MacLab interface unit that accepts and conditions signals from compatible physiological sensors and transducers. Computer acquisition of data permits students to make better use of limited and valuable laboratory time involved in recording data, conducting appropriate statistical analysis of results, and writing interpretations as they develop their laboratory skills in preparation for the analytical and diagnostic applications they will encounter in their upper-division life science or advanced health specialties."
