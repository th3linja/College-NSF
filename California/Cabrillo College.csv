This research focuses on developing strategies that enhance interest and motivation of students and improve persistence and graduation rates in undergraduate STEM programs at Hispanic-Serving Institutions. This project will evaluate the impact that an engineering service-learning abroad project has on Latino and low-income students' academic commitment and persistence in completing engineering degrees. Engineering service-learning abroad activities are effective motivators and career development experiences for students.  Such experiences instill an appreciation for the world-changing potential that engineering offers.  However, often the high cost of participation in service-learning abroad makes these experiences effectively out-of-reach for many engineering students attending two-year colleges. This project will expand the existing engineering service-learning abroad program at Cabrillo and make it possible for low income students to participate. It is expected that engineering service-learning abroad will have a positive influence on their commitment to engineering careers and persistence to degree completion. This study will accumulate data to test this hypothesis. A positive result will provide useful information regarding strategies that might be used to increase the number of low-income and Latino students who persist in engineering majors and complete degrees.<br/><br/>Cabrillo College Engineering Abroad Program conducts engineering service-learning abroad activities. The out-of-county component to this program takes place in Latin America.  The existing program will be expanded in the course of this study. Projects focus on areas of dire need and the recent engineering abroad project was a rainwater catchment system to provide potable water to a small village. Initial work at Cabrillo indicates the potential of this engineering service learning abroad program to enhance the interest and motivation of students and improve their persistence.  Initial work shows Latino student participants are integral to the project team because of their unique understanding of Hispanic culture and their skill as translators. Many Latino students have not traveled outside the United States. However their unique background results in their serving as leaders of the group which is the reverse of their experience in traditional classrooms. These experiences were found to have a dramatic impact on Latino student feelings of self-efficacy and empowerment. This project will more thoroughly investigate and document these results.<br/><br/>The project will yield evaluation data regarding the extent to which these activities have improved the skills of the participants. Established service-learning assessment methods will be used to measure: civic engagement, industry-relevant skills, global/cultural skills, personal growth, academic and career growth, and engineering skills. Other quantitative measurements will compare the academic performance and degree progress of students participating in the engineering abroad experience to corresponding outcomes achieved by students in a comparison group.  Qualitative analyses will be employed to explore how the experience abroad may have contributed to changes in students' confidence, plans for the future, perception of themselves as leaders, and commitment to the field of engineering."

This NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project will award scholarships to help increase the number of students who complete associates degrees in engineering at Cabrillo College, transfer to 4-year institutions, and seek careers in STEM.  As many as 84 scholars will participate in a three-year program, designed to immerse them in academic enrichment activities including participation in a learning community and a course meant to help them to develop strong professional identities through doing hands-on projects, interacting with local engineers, and touring local industry.  The institution's STEM Center, will provide students with an abundance of resources including academic, career and financial aid advising, transfer assistance, mentorships, field trips, scholarship assistance, and study groups.  <br/><br/>The project will address three challenges that Cabrillo College students face while attempting to obtain a STEM degree (a) long time to transfer (four or more years), (b) lack of math preparation and subsequent inability to succeed in precalculus, and (c) the high cost of living in the area.  The scholars will participate in the Math, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) program facilitated through the STEM Center.  MESA will provide students with intensive precalulus preparation and peer-lead Academic Excellence workshops in math, engineering, computer science, and physics for those students who pass precalculus.  Formative evaluation will address student and mentor satisfaction (surveys), the viability of the students' educational plan, and academic progress.  Summative evaluation will consist of an analysis of how well the project components align with successful attainment of the retention and graduation targets.  Dissemination of the results of evaluation will be done through the annual MESA Leadership Retreat and the Research and Planning Group Strengthening Student Success conference (for California community college faculty and administrators) and help contribute to expanding the knowledge base regarding the circumstances under which programs of this type are successful."

These problems have contributed to  students in Human Physiology laboratories becoming observers,  rather than active participants in laboratory experiments.  The  goal of this project is to provide more investigative and  cooperative learning experiences for students by: 1) restructuring  the curriculum to foster inquiry and teamwork; and 2) equipping  them with computer controlled data acquisition technology.   Students are learning science and critical thinking by actively  participating in hands-on laboratory exercises, working in small  groups to gather data, using computers to analyze the data, and  discussing and presenting their findings.    Computer workstations with accompanying data acquisition hardware  and software, and a computer network are being employed to  accomplish these goals.  In restructuring the curriculum to include  the new equipment, care is being taken to design a user-friendly  environment that encourages teamwork and active learning,  especially for under prepared students lacking a technological  background.  A thorough critique of this project and the results of  its evaluation will be presented and published nationally."

Students are providing assistance in making, testing and implementing the exercises.  The aims of this curriculum are to improve students' skills in using software, their understanding of MO theory and appreciation of the scope and limitations of computational chemistry.  We are implementing the tutorials and exercises through the establishment of a consortium of local community colleges including Monterey Peninsula College, Gavilan College, Hartnell College, San Jose City College, DeAnza College, and Diablo Valley College. Students at those institutions have free access to WebMO on a Cabrillo College server.  We are providing support to participating college faculty through professional development workshops, a web site and personal communication.   The results of this project have the potential to be disseminated nationwide through adoption of the new curriculum materials and replication of the consortium model.  <br/>"

They are older, economically disadvantaged, they work many hours off campus, and often come from under represented minorities. Unfortunately, they are also under prepared to succeed in college. The application of computer technologies can help us shape new strategies that promote learning, achievement and retention of these students and thus increase our educational productivity.     The goal of this project is to improve the learning of chemical concepts through the increased use of computer visualization. A team, consisting mainly of undergraduate students from our college, will produce chemical visualization software in a highly modularized form and will disseminate it at very low cost through both the Internet and CD-ROMs. We will test the viability of this approach as a learning experience for students.     These software products will also benefit students nationwide by supplementing traditional instruction with the power of visualization. They will help chemistry and biology teachers make the transition to instruction at a higher level of technology and could be useful in constructing course materials for distance education."
