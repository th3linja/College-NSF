At the same time, the development of new fuels and technologies has outpaced the supply of adequately educated technicians to satisfy industry demand. Traditionally, transportation technicians have been trained in short term programs, but these programs are no longer adequate since the new technologies require a different core of knowledge. This project is developing a new 11 - 14 program leading to as associate degree in environmental transportation technology with particular emphasis on new curriculum in technical areas in gaseous fuels technology combined with a broad general education component in science, information science, communications, mathematics, and applied physics. Participating directly with College of the Desert to create and test this new program are three other community colleges in California (San Diego Mirimar, Alameda, and Rio Hondo). These institutions are joined in this effort by five other California community colleges who form the Advanced Transportation Technology Initiative, the Desert Tech Prep Consortium, the American Society of Advanced Fuels Technology, and numerous industrial and government partners. Workshops for two-year college faculty and secondary school teachers are being conducted to develop expertise in this new curriculum."

This project is providing scholarships that will lower this major barrier for our STEM majors and motivate our students while they are attending and preparing for transfer to a four-year institution. The S-STEM scholars receive major support through the established Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) Program. S-STEM scholars are also divided into small faculty-led cohorts of students based on their majors. These cohorts provide mentoring, academic and social support, and professional development guidance. Our program targets those students who are traditionally underrepresented: however, assistance will be available to any STEM student attending the institution who meets the minimum requirements. This program is increasing the number of students who successfully complete their coursework and transfer to 4-year institutions in a STEM field. It is anticipated that this programmatic model can be adapted for use with other MESA Programs throughout the state and other community colleges. <br/><br/>"

The primary objective of this project is to increase the supply of new and existing workers who possess the requisite core academic knowledge and technical skills needed to compete in the area of advanced transportation technologies. The four major activities which are producing programs and products are: (1) Curriculum & Instructional Materials Development; (2) Faculty and Teacher Professional Development; (3) Recruitment and Retention of Minorities and other Nontraditional and Under-served Populations; and (4) Internship Experiences for Students and Instructors. The expected outcome is a Tech Prep Associate Degree Program for Grades 11-14 and for adults re-entering the workforce. Notable collaborations include the California Advanced Transportation Technology Initiative, College of Engineering Center for Environmental Research and Technology at the University of California Riverside, West Virginia University's National Alternative Fuels Training Center, Schatz Energy Research Center at Humboldt State University, Georgetown University Fuel Cell Program, SunLineTransit Agency, National Automotive Center, John Deere, DOE/Clean Cities, Service Technicians Society (STS), and the Coachella Valley Economic Partnership."
