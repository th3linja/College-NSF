Some of those who are part-time students can now enroll full-time. Those who are full-time are advancing more quickly by increasing their load and/or by enhancing their performance. <br/><br/>The NSF Scholars Program is linked to the student support infrastructure of the Math, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) Program, which is located at each of the three Los Rios colleges. This national model provides students pursuing majors in computer science, math, engineering, or engineering technology with the student support infrastructure necessary to enhance their transferability to four-year schools and their continuance in the major. This infrastructure includes the components of recruitment, academic support and mentoring, applications oriented experiences, retention, and transfer support. Activities within these components include tutoring, faculty and student mentoring, counseling, internships, field trips and job shadowing, leadership training, technology and math/science bootcamps, enrichment programs and the opportunity to provide community service to enhance the profession. All this is done under the umbrella of the Los Rios District and the MESA Industry/Education Advisory Council. <br/><br/>The NSF Scholars Coordinating Committee, a 13-member committee consisting of Los Rios faculty, managers, and staff is monitoring and evaluating the program. The administrative plan includes close monitoring of a well-defined selection process and clearly defined and measurable outcomes. Reporting, as required by NSF, is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator in coordination with five other instructional deans, each having responsibility for one or more of the specified majors. <br/><br/>The NSF Scholars Selection Committee, a 12-member committee, with representatives from the three colleges, the three MESA programs, industry professionals and local K-12 and four-year institutions, is screening and selecting the NSF Scholars. <br/>"

Important aspects of this project is the identification of key CT skills and competencies critical at each point along the K through 14 education continuum; assessment tools for accurately measuring acquisition of CT skills; and the small-scale pilot of infusion strategies to test the promise of the model. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit <br/>For over a decade, concern has continued to rise over the relative lack of enrollment and completion in STEM programs, particularly at the University level. All segments of education have tried in various ways to address the leaks in the STEM pipeline, but without significant success. This project is implementing a strategy that uses CT skills as both a solution for these long-standing problems and as a measure of the project's success, emphasizing the higher education success and output to industry. There are compelling challenges to address, including a cultural change rate that requires unprecedented agility on the part of education as it prepares for its input audience (students). At the earliest stages, education will need to adjust its curriculum, classroom pedagogy and pace to advance its students through this first section of the pipeline. With better prepared incoming students, the community college can do a more thorough job of moving STEM students into the course material and practical experiences which will help assure their sustained interest in the field. The interest of universities who receive inputs from community colleges is that students are prepared for the challenges of the next level of study, and are focused enough to complete their chosen program. Business and industry rightly expect candidates for their open positions who are work ready, and possess the CT skills (and others) that will make them a good investment. <br/><br/>Another portion of the pipeline that has been somewhat neglected is the end, where these long-term investments drop off the STEM grid. Businesses, educational institutions, and government agencies work hard to create intellectual capital in their employees, only to see them disappear with many potential years of productive work life still ahead of them. This commodity is quite expensive to replace, and may require years to accomplish. Businesses and other employers who have been part of the Sacramento Regional CPATH Team meetings agree that they have serious challenges with losing out on these investments just when they need them most. A goal of this project is to assist employers, through interaction within the project team, to address their retention needs through innovative approaches to optimizing these investments. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/>This project effectively engages CPATH partners in a collaborative development process that will endure long into the future as the technology landscape continues to change. The output of this collaboration will not only be a plan for infusion of CT skill to address the needs of an accelerating technological economy, but also to secure relationships which will support adaptation of this plan to address emerging needs. The project team is cooperating to be agile, effective and efficient in maintaining the integrity of the K through 14 pipeline for CT-skilled workers. This project has the potential to benefit a wide range of stakeholders to include the K-12, community college, and university systems within the greater Sacramento region as well as other portions of northern California (through dissemination strategies); information technology employers, and the residents of the region in general as broad transformation will lead to increased talent and economic competitiveness. It is significant that this project includes activities at the K-12, community college, and university levels, maximizing the reach of the project to include a large and highly diverse student population. The instructional models and new ways of thinking about computing that are expected to result from this project will lead to increased enrollment in computing programs in Los Rios and Sacramento State. This will help to increase the diversity of the computing workforce in the region."

The project combines an intensive five-day workshop with a subsequent online course and industry internship. The project includes conducting five-day summer workshops for instructors to learn the basics of informatics and biological applications. The workshop participants then participate in a semester-long online class in the fall to further enhance their knowledge and comfort level with bioinformatics. The following spring, the faculty participates in internships in<br/>local labs to use their new skills, work with real-world data and applications of the new technology, and form relationships with local bioinformatics scientists. Project products are community college faculty highly trained and prepared to train students for jobs in bioinformatics, accessible, relevant, and easily updateable instructional materials, and relationships with local bioinformaticists to provide support and consultation.<br/>By training community college instructors, the project has a broad impact. Community colleges are the frontline of higher education and serve many more students than do four-year institutions, due to greater accessibility and lower costs. Through these instructors, we are impacting the greatest number of workforce-bound individuals possible. Based on class size at several community colleges, we estimate that this project is exposing an estimated 2,000 students to bioinformatics in a single school year. Courses, follow-up-services, instructional manuals and informational updates facilitate institutionalizing bioinformatics into the local community college curricula. We are targeting faculty from community colleges with proportionally higher populations of underrepresented groups. By training a cadre of faculty, this project is permanently impacting the capacity of the community colleges to teach bioinformatics, and create relationships among trained faculty, UC Davis personnel, and industry scientists."

The work is a collaborative effort between three regional engineering and technology consortia in California. Through their efforts they have been able to join the Silicon Valley Engineering/ Technology Consortia (SVE/TC) and the Sacramento Regional Engineering and Technology Consortia (SETRC) together with California State University-Northridge (CSUN) to establish the Los Angeles Engineering and Technology Consortia and create/deliver/support a world-class K-12 robotics curriculum. The project has two structural and three functional components. The structural elements are to organize the Los Angeles consortium and expand the interrelationships of the regional consortia in the state to create a pathway for K-16 students engaged in manufacturing and technology careers. Functionally the project builds a standards-based K-12 robotics curriculum to attract and engage students in manufacturing and technology and provide extensive professional development in support of robotics curricula and competitions. <br/><br/>The project is also engaging non-traditional students and teachers in technology careers through robotics courses. Teachers are contracted to develop the curriculum and training materials as well as deliver workshops specific to the needs of a range of teachers from entry through advanced levels. Strong industry support is expected for these training activities that range from conference presentations up to two-week workshops. During the second and third years, a Statewide Robotics Conference is held in the Los Angeles area. Efforts have been directed toward creating an infrastructure to engage middle and high school students along with an audience of K-16. Teachers are delivering and receiving robotics-related professional development through the three regional consortia and their industry partners. The ultimate goal is to continually excite students and engage them in order to encourage them toward careers in STEM. The project is doing this by engaging students in regional and national competitions including Lego League, Bot Ball, Red Rover and Robotics FIRST."

Currently our dispersive instrument is used for a variety of tasks. The organic students use IR as a tool for substance identification including reaction rnixture/product analysis and the investigation of components in naturaI product mixtures. Analyses performed with our current IR spectrophotometer are slow. The low student throughput and the lack of modem features limits our ability to update existing curricula. We propose to update the spectroscopy component of our curriculum and replace our dispersive IR with an FT-IR spectrophotometer. The main beneficiary of this project will be the organic chemistry courses at SCC, however, allied health chemistry students as well as second semester general chemistry students will also benefit. The incorporation of FT-IR into the organic chemistry curriculum will allow for the enhancement and modernization of existing experiments, the introduction of new methods of data analysis, and the discussion of FT-IR theory. The use of FT-IR and reflectance accessories will virtually eliminate the time constraints associated with the use of our dispersive instrument, thereby allowing for increased student access to lR spectroscopic methods. For allied health students, a more instructive and meaningful experience with IR will be possible. The introduction of FT-IR into general chemistry will provide students with a connection between acquisition of data and theoreticaI concepts presented in lecture as well as hands-on experience with a type of instrumentation which is used in industry and in the upcoming, higher level coursework students will eventually encounter."

The MESA model specifically targets these students through outreach and access to the program and its components reaching to approximately 3,500 students per year. Our focus is to build and expand on MESA's existing service infrastructure by establishing the Basic and Advanced Science and Technology Academies of Research (B A STAR) project. We believe that the BA STAR has the potential to directly and indirectly increase the number of students obtaining technical degrees by providing students the opportunity to develop technical, teamwork and leadership abilities. The BA STAR Program consists of four major components:<br/><br/>(1) Leadership Development Conference (Year 1)<br/>(2) Basic Science and Technology Academy of Research (Year 1)<br/>(3) Training and Employment as Academic Workshop Leaders (Year 2)<br/>(4) Advanced Science and Technology Academy of Research (Year 2)<br/><br/>During the first year students participate in a Leadership Development Conference (LDC). A cohort of these students is then invited to participate in the Basic Science and Technology Academy of Research (B STAR) following the LDC. The B STAR focuses on providing a core understanding of physics principles as well as developing technical computer skills. During Year Two of the program, the cohort is employed as facilitators for Academic Excellence Workshops (AEW) during the academic year. An AEW is a small community of students working collaboratively to master technical course material with the facilitator's guidance. During the summer of Year Two, the same cohort participates in one of five Advanced Science and Technology Academies of Research (A STAR). Each A STAR is research and project oriented, relating to the participant's academic major with the guidance of a faculty or industry mentor. The BA STAR project collects appropriate data for both formative and summative evaluation. The project also tracks and evaluates student participants to verify increased persistence, completion and/or transfer or job placement. Information regarding this project is included in MESA recruitment strategies and materials. Moreover, we intend to disseminate the project's results across the nation via peer-reviewed published articles, presented at relevant conferences, and posted on the Internet."
