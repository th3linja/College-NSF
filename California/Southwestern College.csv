Over five years, this project will fund 120 scholarships to four groups of 30 students who are pursuing associate degrees at Southwestern College, and 45 scholarships for 30 transfer students and 15 graduate students who are pursuing baccalaureate and graduate degrees in chemistry and biochemistry at San Diego State University.  This project will create an integrated mentoring and research pathway that bridges the chemistry and biochemistry programs at Southwestern College and San Diego State University. Both Southwestern College and San Diego State University are Hispanic-Serving Institutions.  As a result, the project has the potential to improve diversity in STEM graduate programs and careers by identifying and removing roadblocks to student transfer and post-transfer success. Along with financial support, scholars will have opportunities to participate in sustained undergraduate research experiences throughout their academic careers. Additional supports include: mentoring by faculty, graduate students, and peers; opportunities for students to attend and present their research at national and regional professional conferences; and career/graduate school application workshops. Mentors will participate in training on best practices in mentoring to ensure high-quality research experiences for all students. These proposed activities are designed to provide a mentored pathway from community college into graduate school and STEM careers. <br/><br/>The objectives of this project are to: improve student success, retention, and completion of chemistry courses and degrees at Southwestern College and at San Diego State University; facilitate transfer of academically talented, low-income students to San Diego State University as Chemistry/Biochemistry majors; and increase graduate school acceptance rates and/or STEM career placement rates after graduation. Knowledge generation activities will focus on three areas. First, the project will examine how scholarships and participation in program activities affect traditional metrics of student success such as GPA, transfer rates, persistence, loans, time to degree, career plans, and employment after degree. Second, using the lens of social cognitive career theory and measurements of scientific self-efficacy, confidence, scientific identity, and sense of belonging, it will examine how students' affective domain is influenced by program activities. Finally, the mentoring activities themselves will be evaluated to understand the effects of structured mentoring experiences on both mentors and mentees. Dissemination of results through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and outreach will enable other community college-university partnerships to apply lessons learned from this program to enhance student success in other locations. It is expected that the research projects in which students participate will also produce new scientific knowledge in chemistry, including organic chemistry, chemical biology, medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, catalysis, physical chemistry, and analytical chemistry.  This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result of departmental self-evaluation, a pressing need to improve of our  laboratory instrumentation has been identified. The complete laboratory curriculum has been overhauled to accommodate creative applications of FTIR, GCMS, HPLC, and NMR techniques into the experiments. Additionally, the new laboratory experiments have been developed to emphasize methods employed in the biotechnology industry, as SWC is located in a region where the market is heavily dominated by this industry. Furthermore, collaborative student research projects are planned between the Biology and Chemistry departments to stimulate activities like those that occur in the biotechnology setting. Ultimately, the new chemistry curriculum, strengthened by the addition of the new instrumentation, will be part of a proposed Biotechnology  Certificate program at SWC. Upon completion of the SWC chemistry curriculum, students bound for the primary four-year transfer institutions in the University of California and California State University systems will be well prepared for utilizing laboratory instrumentation at the level of sophistication found at those institutions. Moreover, those students studying to enter the biotechnology workforce as technicians, directly from SWC, will already have experience with the state-of-the-art techniques and instrumentation that they will encounter in the workplace, making them more competitive for employment."

Part of the solution to this problem lies in revising our educational system so that science is taught as a process in which all citizens are engaged at some level.   In an across-the-curriculum research project students will acquire many of the science process skills essential to scientific literacy.  While conducting library as well as laboratory or field research, students will organize information; form and test hypotheses; decide whether data supports a statement; separate correlation from cause and effect; modify their hypotheses as the data demands; and regularly report on their progress to peers and the community.  The overarching goal is to model how scientific research is conducted and used to address real problems.   The research project focuses on water quality and the effects on ecosystems of poor water quality.  Each course in the freshmen general education program is involved in research activity.  After a period of data collection, students formulate hypotheses and design experiments to test those hypotheses.  Student-generated proposals form the basis of the research undertaken by the next class of freshman.  Student-designed research plans will also be tackled by advanced courses.  Regular symposia promote sharing and synthesis of results between research groups.   This proposal involves all first year students in scientific research.  We are especially excited about the impact on education students.  The science classes that our future elementary school teachers experience must provide them models for how to integrate science into their curriculum, or they will be handicapped as they attempt that task.  In this approach, elementary education students would experience science as related to many general education courses.  We hope to provide a model for transforming the role of sc ience in general education curricula."

Gateway mathematics courses are the first transfer-level mathematics course taken by most students intending to pursue a STEM major. These courses traditionally have a high failure rate, and are a common barrier for STEM-intending students from historically underserved communities. In addition, these courses are undergoing a shift as state law is impacting policies related to student placement. With this project, a collaborative team from a two-year institution and a four-year institution will analyze trends in student success, develop classroom-based interventions and professional development for instructors of gateway mathematics courses, study the impacts of the interventions, and examine the sustainability of change efforts. This work will have an impact locally by transforming gateway mathematics courses enrolling up to 10,000 students across the life of the project. By improving gateway mathematics courses, this project will contribute to the societal benefit of broadening participation in STEM majors and careers. This effort will also result in generalizable knowledge about institutional change in STEM departments at two-year HSIs, and the results will be disseminated through research publications, workshops, network improvement communities, and professional development conferences.<br/><br/>The project will proceed in three phases. In Phase 1 the researchers will collect and analyze institutional and classroom-level data to inform a change effort. Analyses will use descriptive and inferential statistics, case study analysis, and be informed by inquiry learning and institutional change frameworks. In Phase 2, the researchers will engage in cycles of design research and professional development to build the capacity of mathematics instructors to leverage inquiry- and equity-oriented teaching practices in order to expand student success in gateway mathematics courses. In Phase 3, the research team will gradually reduce the active intervention, and study the sustainability of the changes enacted in Phase 2. The results of this work will be a model for the reform and redesign of gateway STEM courses in two-year HSIs. These results will be disseminated through research publications, workshops, network improvement communities, and professional development conferences.
