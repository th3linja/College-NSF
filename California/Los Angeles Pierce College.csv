The project replicates professional experiences while providing direct benefits to society as students design and implement solutions to existing problems in a multidisciplinary, collaborative environment. The Collaboratory Achievement Project To Impact the Value of Architecture & Engineering Technology Education (CAPTIVATE) develops a program where students engage with effective role models, have culturally responsive experiences, and recognize the EG&DT and AT programs as a pathway to professions with social impact. This approach benefits students, campus, employers, and the community.<br/><br/>Los Angeles Pierce College is working to engage EG&DT and AT students in an experiential learning environment that fosters students' intrinsic motivation in order to advance them toward a credential and strengthen their 21st century skills, particularly problem-solving and collaboration. CAPTIVATE coordinates curricular and extracurricular projects consisting of six key components: project-based learning, multidisciplinary collaboration, real-world connection, community partnerships, tangible impact, and environmental sustainability. Los Angeles Pierce College will strengthen its partnerships with area businesses by aligning curriculum with workforce needs, and providing a conduit for meaningful engagement across the sector. Los Angeles Pierce College is developing a replicable framework that includes generalized and project specific outcomes. Models developed through this project will be shared with other institutions and faculty that are looking to make meaningful change in their programs."

They are one of the six consortium members of  the Interactive Mathematics Text Project jointly sponsored by IBM  and NSF.  Until this project they have used computers to supplement  instruction in an open laboratory that is being used to capacity  for homework assignments. In this project Pierce is using computer  lessons they have developed and are developing as an integral part  of classroom instruction to replace, in part, instructor lectures  with student discovery. In addition,   they are using computers to train high school and college teachers  in the use and development of interactive computer lessons."

The College, located in the western San Fernando Valley has approximately 15,000 students.  The college intends to connect through NETWAY a local Internet  service provider used by all the colleges in the district.  The campus needs the Internet connection to be able to access information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world.  The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of this institution as well as the community in general.  The award provides partial support of the project for two years."

Although a good portion  of the lecture is spent on cell molecular biology, many of these  topics remain abstract and esoteric since students have been  unable to perform experiments in the laboratory.  This project,  involving a 2-year community college, a 4-year university, and  private industry, establishes a biotechnology consortium to  prepare laboratory investigations that give students hands-on  experience with fundamental techniques used in biotechnology.    These experiments parallel topics discussed in lectures.   The  investigations involve: (1) an introduction to DNA science; (2)  DNA restriction analysis; and (3) recombinant DNA technology.   Individuals primarily affected are biology majors, those  preparing for careers in medicine, biological research, and  teaching.   About 200 students per year will use the equipment  and protocols of this project.  The laboratory investigations are  initially being integrated into the major's biology course and  microbiology.    These experiments serve as a basis for expansion  into a separate, biotechnology course and provide the stimulus to  initiate a techprep program.   The new equipment is so  fundamental to performing biotechnology protocols that it can  provide the flexibility to allow expansion into these courses."
