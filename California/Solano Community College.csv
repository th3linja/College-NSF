This NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at Solano Community College (SCC) will address this need and contribute to the national effort to produce more STEM graduates by providing financial, academic, and personal support to academically-talented and financially needy students across all STEM disciplines at SCC. This project will pursue an innovative and promising 2+1 program for which students at SCC majoring in a STEM area will receive two years of support if they maintain a 3.0 grade point average (GPA). In turn, they will be awarded an additional year of support to continue their study, if they transfer to a four-year institution to be a STEM major. SCC will award twenty-five (25) to thirty-five (35) scholarships per year. Likewise, the project will build on existing student support services and develop new ones for the scholars.  <br/><br/>The 2+1 STEM Scholarship Program at SCC will take a comprehensive approach and will have multiple interesting and creative components, which should not only be effective at SCC, but also have significant potential to serve as models for other institutions, especially community colleges. These components will include, but not be limited to: (i) offering S-STEM scholarships at high school graduations to recruit students who plan to major in a STEM discipline; (ii) providing multi-stage mentoring from peers to faculty members, with a particular approach to pairing first-generation college students with more advanced first-generation students; (iii) building partnerships with industry to provide more learning, internship, and career awareness opportunities for students, as well as to help improve curricula and meet industry needs; and (iv) providing financial and other support to S-STEM scholars who transfer as STEM majors to a four year institution. These initiatives will work in concert with existing support services at SCC. The investigators will explore and assess the effectiveness of the various components of the project, taken individually and in combination with each other. Their findings will add to the overall knowledge base of STEM education by providing a roadmap leading to successful student intervention strategies, especially related to understanding and improving the pipeline of students from high school through community colleges to four year institutions, many or whom are underrepresented minorities and/or rural and/or low income."

Because these systems offer several advantages over traditional manufacturing platforms, there is an industry trend toward adopting this technology. The industry migration to this new technology is causing a training gap to form within the existing workforce and within biotechnology training curricula. <br/><br/>Solano Community College  is creating curricular materials to address the single-use, disposable bioreactor gap in the national biotechnology curricula and expanding the biotechnology program at the college to incorporate this technology. The project is also developing short courses for students and incumbent workers and workshops for faculty. The project includes three components: curriculum development, implementation and evaluation, and dissemination. The expected outcomes for this project include: 1) an overall design of educational units that can be inserted into courses that utilize single-use cell culture technology; 2) detailed content, learning objectives, teaching materials and instruction activities for the new units; 3) implementation of the curriculum at the college and other institutions; 4) workshops to disseminate the curriculum; 5) development of a web site hosting the model curriculum and other information generated from this project; and 6) courseware containing the course materials for distribution.<br/><br/>Since this project is developing curricular materials that address an identified industry need that have not been included in two-year biotechnology programs, it has the potential to impact many two-year biotechnology programs across the country as the project creates exemplary materials that can be used by other programs to teach single-use bioreactor technology in order to meet industrial demand. The impact is being magnified through the dissemination by BioLink, a national biotechnology consortium that has created a community of scholars that encourages collaboration, cooperation, and communication in biotechnology. To facilitate information dissemination, workshops are being organized to train faculty who want to adopt this curriculum. The project will also contribute to the national effort to develop a technically skilled workforce for the national bio-economy."
