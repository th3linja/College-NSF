The certificate program is designed around the                 existing curricula at MiraCosta College with the addition of                    two courses specifically focused on biotechnology.  One of                      these courses, Methods in Biotechnology will require students                   to conduct laboratory experiments that teach the underlying                     molecular biology concepts and techniques essential to                          biotechnology."

Providing 50% of  the biotechnology industry and 17% of higher education  opportunities, California recognizes the imperative to plan a  Center that addresses the needs of industry and the needs for basic  science education and science literacy.  This project will develop a complete and comprehensive plan to  target needs for all students in biotechnology and basic science  courses, especially those from under represented populations, and  provide a national model for curriculum improvement and development  at each stage in the educational/occupational continuum in  biotechnology. California Biotechnology Consortium membership and  a Center Steering Committee will provide leadership for planning  curriculum, faculty enhancement, equipment needs, evaluation and  dissemination.  Five leaders in education have been selected for  the roles of lead principal investigator and co-principal  investigators.  Conferences, electronic networking and  teleconferences will provide the means to develop written reports  and a detailed proposal for an Advanced Biotechnology Education  Center."
