The project will develop a new ""Institute for Water Studies"" that embeds contextualized STEM learning opportunities in technical courses at the college. It will also work with local 7-12 math and science teachers to provide contextualized teaching modules and demonstrations of water and wastewater equipment for 7-12 students. Students at the college will assemble an above-ground water distribution system that allows them to hone their mechanical skills and gain relevant job experience in the classroom. Through these activities, the project will develop career pathways that recruit women, underrepresented students, and veterans into careers in water and wastewater management. <br/><br/>As part of their effort to educate the next generation of water technicians and replace an aging workforce, the California WaterWorks project will develop new stackable certifications in water treatment, water distribution, wastewater treatment, and wastewater collection. These certificates will offer multiple entrance, multiple exit pathways aligned with industry standards and credentials. The project will also implement the ACT WorkKeys and National Career Readiness Certification materials to improve students' job readiness and soft skills. To support recruitment efforts, the project will work with ATETV to produce a series of recruitment video that target women and transitioning military personnel with STEM skills, and inform them of career opportunities in the water and wastewater management industries. The curricula, videos, and other teaching materials will be shared with other community colleges through the ATE network."

The Principal Investigator will institute a combination of the nationally recognized microcomputer-based laboratory curriculum and incorporate modern instrumentation and laboratory equipment. Specific curricular changes will be made in the areas of kinematics, dynamics and thermodynamics. In conjunction with the redesigned curriculum, the Principal Investigator will implement learning communities into the Physics laboratory experience. Advanced Engineering students will work with at-risk, underrepresented students to develop collaborative learning, teamwork and group problem-solving skills."

Working with the large telecommunications Industry in the area, the project establishes a hands-on teaching and learning telecommunications laboratory and a comprehensive curriculum that includes web-based learning modules and self-paced tutorials, and teacher education workshops. The project develops articulation agreements with feeder high school districts and partners with four-year colleges and universities in the San Diego area. To increase the representation of women in telecommunications technology, the project provides counseling and encouragement of high school women and student and faculty mentoring of women students along with a dedicated website."
