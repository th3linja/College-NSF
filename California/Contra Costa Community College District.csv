Because mathematics serves as a gatekeeper for information technology majors and careers, African Americans are also disproportionately shut out of these areas. In order to better understand the societal, community, school, and intra-personal forces that affect their under-representation, Contra Costa College and Dr. Danny Martin have been awarded a three-year ethnographic and observational study that will focus on mathematics socialization and mathematics identity among a diverse group of African Americans. <br/><br/>The participants in this study will be African American parents, community members, students and teachers of students selected from communities in two northern California cities-Richmond and San Pablo. Both cities are located within 50 miles of Silicon Valley and have significant African American populations.  The two cities also have school systems that are representative of many urban districts.  The project will also focus on selected programs, services, staff, and students at Contra Costa College, an institution that has had a high rate of success in transferring minority students to four-year colleges and universities in mathematics, computer science, and engineering. <br/><br/><br/>"

The objective is to award 72 two-year scholarships to students who enroll full-time into a computer science, engineering, or mathematics curriculum. Contra Costa College provides a student-support infrastructure through its Center for Science Excellence (CSE) that facilitates their successful graduation with an associate-level degree and transfer to a four-year college or university. The student-support infrastructure of the college coordinates formal study, work experience in science and technology, and various science- and technology-based activities through a social support system. It provides academic support in the form of mentoring, academic workshops, tutoring, internship opportunities, leadership development, scientific seminars, and field trips. <br/><br/>The scholarship awards are being distributed to the recipients during the first and second years of enrollment at the College. Scholarship recipients enroll as full-time students, are expected to maintain a minimum 3.0 grade point average, and follow an educational plan prescribing a sequence of courses that enable them to graduate and transfer to a baccalaureate-granting institution. National Science Foundation scholarship money provides a unique opportunity for low-income students to gain access to a support system that would not normally be possible because of their need to concentrate their time on jobs rather than study. Experience shows that gaining access to a coordinated support system of mentoring, internships, and enrichment activities along with high academic expectations is an important contribution to success for the students. Without stipend or scholarship money, a large population of students is locked out of the mathematics/science pipeline. Scholarship money for low-income community college students is a beacon of hope for students who might not otherwise gain access to programs in computer sciences, engineering, or mathematics.<br/>"

Four cohorts of 30 students each will participate. Research opportunities and internships for students will be coordinated by the Center for Science at Contra Costa College, which engages in collaborative partnerships with many regional National laboratories and local industries.<br/><br/>Peer Lead Team Learning (PLTL) will be utilized to deepen conceptual knowledge and understanding.  A learning community will be built through participation in the Center for Science, which models the approach of Uri Treisman for student support. Experts from the Lawrence Hall of Science will oversee the research aspects of this project.  Together with members of the principal investigator (PI) team, they will study whether or not reducing students' financial burden helps them to complete their academic goals, whether or not summer bridge activities improve the STEM pipeline, and how the PLTL model helps student learning and increases student success.  Broader impacts will be gained via workforce development opportunities for students as well as promoting transfer to 4-year institutions. Metrics for evaluating the project's implementation activities will include short-term goals for scholarship recipients (e.g. 85% year-to-year retention), mid-term goals for transferring to a baccalaureate institution (80% of scholars transfer within three years), and long-term graduation goals for the transfer students (90% attaining a baccalaureate degree within six years)."

The partnership is developing, delivering and expanding transformative content for chemistry education within a single, integrated online resource known as The ChemWiki.  The ChemWiki is organized around a collaborative approach to chemistry education where an Open Access textbook is constantly being written and re-written, partly by students and partly by faculty, resulting in a no-fee, high-quality textbook, accessible anytime, anywhere, by anyone with internet access.  The ChemWiki is enabling Wikitexts to be created by individual faculty by ordering modular content in a way that is meeting localized needs, and is allowing other Core Modules to be modified via an embedded graphical editor, and then incorporated into the Wikitext.  The ever growing list of Wikitexts is available for anyone to peruse, adapt and adopt as needs dictate.  The ChemWiki is incorporating a separate application, the 'Student Ability Rating and Inquiry System' (SARIS) that is addressing the need for student practice, by incorporating an extensive question database augmented with links to the ChemWiki core material.  SARIS is providing quiz and homework questions, drawn from a deep pool, and is providing students with immediate formative feedback designed to enhance their problem-solving skills.<br/><br/>The ChemWiki is enabling student participatory learning by engaging them in the content construction.  The nature of The ChemWiki modular concept is permitting content to be used and re-used in multiple courses at multiple levels.  The open and dynamic nature of The ChemiWiki is allowing both straightforward error correction and timely content with near instantaneous modification possible for state-of-the-art material.  The multiple author construction approach is enhancing usage flexibility by the very nature of the breadth of strategies employed.  Finally, the inter-institutional development scheme is leading to a product of distinct value across a broad swath of institutions of higher education."

These instruments will provide students with the ability to measure several biological functions (e.g. heart sounds, pulse, and EKG) simultaneously, and to store this data for analysis, manipulation, and graphing.  This will enable the department to cease using live animals for experimentation, and substitute non-invasive techniques on human subjects.  This will prove more relevant and interesting to many students, especially those in pre-clinical programs.  The requested instruments replace very old physiographs and transducers used in traditional muscle experiments and allow new labs on, for example intracellular membrane potentials, respiration (where volumes are coordinated with rate), circulation (heart sounds, pulse, blood pressure, and EKG) EMG measurements on skeletal muscle, and students on locomotion.  Additionally, computer analysis and graphing of data will become routine in all of the department's courses.  The computers and hardware/software will be portable and will be employed throughout the department's laboratory courses, serving approximately 1,100 students per year.  Experiments using this instrumentation will be published in course laboratory manuals and will be provided to the MacLab manual and to teaching societies such as Human Anatomy and Physiology Society (HAPS)."

The project will make some use of standard protocols for student exercises, but will also be committed to developing lab exercises for lower-division undergraduate courses. Anticipated exercises include water analysis, environmental analysis, food and forensic analyses, and data handling exercises. For introductory chemistry, as a followup to electronic spectra, application of AA will be brought into a laboratory exercise, for example by analyzing water samples for sodium or paint samples for lead. In general chemistry, AA is to be used in a more rigorous way, including at least one AA exercise each semester. The first semester will compare metal analysis results from AA and home water test kits, or a comparable exercise. In the second semester, the AA will be used for environmental applications, by incorporating a mini-site assessment in the laboratory. Exercises in field sampling and sample preparation will be incorporated. In quantitative analysis, the AA instrument will be used to educate students in the rigorous standards routinely required to meet regulatory agency standards for metals analysis in water, soil and other analytes, using both flame and graphite furnace methods in suitable ""real-world"" analysis situations. The instrument will also be used for student independent study projects, to examine aspects of local water quality and soil pollution. The project intends also to develop short exercises that can be used by the administration of justice and biotechnology programs at Contra Costa College."

The STEMWiki Hyperlibrary consists of a number of connected, discipline-focused hypertext applications (ChemWiki, BioWiki, MathWiki, StatWiki, GeoWiki, PhysWiki), which are freely accessible to students regardless of socioeconomic or educational backgrounds. The ChemWiki (http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu) is currently the most developed STEMWiki, with millions of visits each month. By making high-quality STEM learning resources readily available, the project will positively impact at least four main populations: (1) the non-science community; (2) socioeconomically disadvantaged students; (3) smaller or financially disadvantaged academic institutions, including high schools, that wish to adopt new learning technologies but cannot afford the initial steep costs of a new curriculum; and (4) discipline-based education researchers looking for a platform on which to evaluate new interdisciplinary approaches and curriculum modifications, which would otherwise absorb too large of a budget to develop from scratch. Once sufficiently developed, the Hyperlibary will be a power platform for the dissemination of new educational content and the evaluation of emerging educational technologies.<br/><br/>The STEMWiki Hyperlibrary is designed as a collaboratively constructed learning environment that enables the dissemination and evaluation of new educational resources and approaches as online course textbooks, with an emphasis on data-driven assessment of student learning and performance. The STEMWikis allow learners to cooperatively construct and organize knowledge, providing an important alternative to ""one size fits all"" instruction in which content is presented in a static, prepackaged manner. In this project, the investigators will augment the constituent STEMWikis of the Hyperlibrary with ancillary homework and simulation applications, as well as formative assessment modules. They will integrate the content of the STEMWikis both horizontally (across multiple STEM fields) and vertically (across multiple levels of complexity) within a network that will provide not just single textbooks but a rich ""hyperlibrary"" through which new, interconnected STEM textbooks can be constructed. The result will be an easy-to-use platform on which faculty members can collaborate to create and publish reusable, online pedagogical content. The project team will add ancillary online homework (the Student Ability Rating and Inquiry System [SARIS]) and simulations (via the ChemCollective, http://www.chemcollective.org). From these components, they will build an assessment infrastructure that tracks and correlates use of individual Wiki-based textbooks with simulations, homework activity, and exam performance, with the goal of identifying and tracking student performance across multiple STEM curricula."
