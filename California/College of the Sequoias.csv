To accomplish this objective, the college will purchase a Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectrophotometer (FTIR) for use with microscale laboratory techniques in the sophomore organic laboratory. The FTIR will allow expansion of spectroscopic analysis in the organic laboratory and to complete conversion to microscale methods and allow increased information about the identity and purity of the small quantities of materials generated by these techniques. It will also allow the introduction of modern spectrographic techniques into the freshmen chemistry courses."

To address these issues, we propose to equip our general biology laboratory with six electrophoresis stations for the manipulation of DNA restriction fragments, a microcentrifuge and incubator for DNA isolation and for transformation experiments. This equipment would allow our students to conduct all of the basic types of manipulations common in molecular biology. Students, in a series of laboratories, will investigate and perform DNA isolations and the recombinant DNA techniques of bacterial transformation and DNA restriction enzyme digests. These laboratories will provide our students with direct experience in the operation of experimental instrumentation and in the performance of investigative experiments. The laboratories will be performed in our biology major courses, our non-major general biology courses and in microbiology."
