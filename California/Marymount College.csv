This incorporation involves two phases and aims to overcome present impediments of incomplete and inconsistent experimental data collection, low student participation and lack of time for students to thoroughly understand concepts. The project is adapted from a NSF-funded program for physiology-based courses at Goshen College (CCLI # 9950383). Students are using more graphic data representation and apply critical thinking skills to data analysis and the development of creative hypotheses. Evaluation of critical thinking skills is being inventoried through questionnaires and surveys. Dissemination of assessment will occur through participation in undergraduate conferences, publications and development of Web sites."

The acquisition of a high speed refrigerated centrifuge and other equipment needed to investigate contemporary techniques in protein and DNA analysis, will allow students to investigate this important area of biology. The acquired skills will give them more choice in selection of independent research projects, and will help female students to gain skills and confidence to continue their studies and/or be competitive for employment in laboratories where such instrumentation is used. The college will provide 50% matching funds."

Lack of suitable instrumentation previously limited coverage largely to lecture/discussion and reading--highly disadvantageous in any laboratory discipline. The project gives junior/senior-level students valuable exposure to modern biological instrumentation and automated data collection methods. The laboratory will also be used for an exercise in General Biology, demonstrations in General Psychology, and appropriate student research."
