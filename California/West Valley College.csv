The              mathematics faculty members have been forward looking in their                  extensive use of the previously available computing devices in their            instructional program.  They are now ready to undertake an expansion            that will incorporate important new technologies, i.e., computer                graphics and symbolic algebra systems."

This project will                        provide 250 undergraduate math faculty with (1) detailed                        training on the mechanics of the calculator, (2) ideas as to                    how the calculator can be used in specific courses, (3) the                     opportunity to develop instructional materials for those                        courses, and (4) the opportunity to share their experiences                     with colleagues.  The four member project team will visit 10                    community college campuses to give these workshops to                           interested two- and four-year college mathematics faculty.                      Each participant will receive a TI-81 graphing calculator and                   each institution a calculator projector kit to encourage                        instructors to continually explore potential uses of graphing                   calculators in mathematics instruction.  The project director                   will create, edit, and publish a newsletter, and three follow-                  up meetings are scheduled so that participating faculty can                     share their experiences."
