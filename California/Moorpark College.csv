The laboratory facilities will be used principally by physics, engineering, chemistry, electro-optic, mathematics and biology majors enrolled in physics laboratory courses at Moorpark College. The equipment will be integrated into the existing calculus-based and trigonometry-based physics curriculums. The College will buy six stations of x-ray diffraction equipment and six stations of electron diffraction apparatus. Typically two students will utilize each station at a given time. By running the x-ray and electron diffraction stations simultaneously, 24 students can be comfortably accommodated in the laboratory facility at a given time. Laboratory instructional materials are also provided with the equipment. A wide variety of student experiments have been developed in areas such as E-M theory, radiography, crystallography and radiation measurement. This wide range of published experiments will allow laboratory instructors to tailor the instructional sessions to the specific educational needs of the students. The college will match the award with an equal amount of funds."

Industry, a community college and four-year universities have partnered and worked together to develop a model curriculum in biomanufacturing focusing on eight modules designed after the departments of a manufacturing facility. This project will utilize the expertise of this consortium and the recently developed curriculum to accomplish the following five goals. 1) Students will be trained in biomanufacturing technologies using the recently developed curriculum which focuses on workplace skills with an option for a Certificate of Achievement or an A.S. degree in Biotechnology. Strategies to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in biotechnology will be addressed. 2) The pedagogical approach to such training, and the second goal of this project, is to set up an instructional manufacturing laboratory which mimics the industrial environment. Using this manufacturing training facility, scientists from industry will be instructors for the modules, guaranteeing that the technical training of students directly matches industry needs. 3) The dearth of instructional materials for training in the manufacturing component of the biotechnology industry will be addressed. A training manual based on the manufacturing modules will be developed and disseminated nationwide. 4) The fourth goal of this project is to provide a prototype program in biomanufacturing to educational institutions engaging in curriculum development. Adaptation of the biomanufacturing curriculum will be facilitated by sponsoring workshops and providing resources for faculty <br/>undertaking curriculum development in biotechnology. 5) The final goal of this project will focus on articulation with secondary schools and four-year universities to delineate a career path in biotechnology and ensure academic preparedness of students."
