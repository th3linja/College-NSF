Traditionally, many students lack intuition for the underlying physical concepts, and as a result the physics and calculus courses present a major hurdle for beginning students, especially women and minorities. This project will improve the learning, retention, and application of physics concepts and principles by physics and calculus students at Diablo Valley College. This will be accomplished by the microcomputer-based laboratories developed by Thorton and Laws and a video projection system. This project will create mobile units of computers that will serve different areas and functions in teaching physics and calculus and will augment the ""Interdisciplinary, team-teaching Calculus and Physics Project"" at Diablo Valley Co lege. This project will improve calculus and physics instruction, increase science literacy, and stimulate other colleges to adapt this approach."

This project addresses an anticipated increase in an IT workforce. The goal of this grant is the development of a comprehensive proposal for a regional center for IT Education, Training and Business Development, based upon Convergent Technologies (CT), that is, the interdisciplinary collaboration of Telecommunications, Media, IT programs and entrepreneurship through collaborative learning programs and internships.<br/><br/>Recent experience with a ""Convergent Technology"" grant at Diablo Valley College showed that there is a connection between the growth of student enrollments in the community colleges during an economic downturn and the growth in entrepreneurial activity in the local economy, especially documented by the county's business incubators. People often return to the community college to enhance or develop their skills, and entrepreneurs fall back on their highly honed skills and venture to ""risk"" a new idea or ""start-up."" They often have a clear idea of the concept, but do not understand business issues. This is where the partnership of the Community Colleges with their local business incubators or Small Business Development Centers has proven so valuable. Student interns, when offered much of the basic business information and skills, succeed. ""Just-in-time"" training opportunities offered on site at the business incubators provided the life raft needed for these businesses at critical times. Hence, challenges became solutions and successful businesses emerged, which meant that new jobs were created.<br/><br/>The IT advisory council concept has been broached to stakeholders in the region and many have indicated a willingness to commit technical expertise, software, hardware, facilities, student internships, faculty development projects and participate in articulation agreements. <br/><br/>The agenda for the first plenary session of the advisory council includes presentations and discussions of: 1) Activities of established IT Centers, 2) CANS IT programs, 3) Existing IT skills standards, 4) Business/Industry/Government needs assessment, 5) Proposed new curricula, 6) Faculty Development, 7) Student Internships, 8) Delivery Systems, 9) Sustainability, and 10) Criteria for Center development. Task forces are being formed to address the key issues identified for the preparation of the proposal for a regional center.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is based upon the qualifications and experience of the CANS Consortium and previous grants in Economic Development for the CANS region. The broader impacts focus on this regional collaboration of business, industry, educational institutions, and government partners, providing opportunities for under-represented groups, among others."

Efforts to provide students with hands-on experience using NMR in the laboratory are greatly aided by converting an outdated Varian EM360 continuous-wave NMR spectrometer into a modern multinuclear Fourier-transform instrument (FTNMR). This cost-effective, user-friendly solution allows rapid data acquisition, making student collection of spectra a routine procedure. Adaptation of experiments from the Journal of Chemical Education and incorporation of FTNMR into current experiments allow students at all stages of their chemical education to have access to the instrument. FTNMR is used across the curriculum to demonstrate the power of the technique in Introductory Chemistry, to determine molecular structure in General Chemistry, and to perform multinuclear and two- dimensional experiments in Organic Chemistry. Early and continued exposure to FTNMR reinforces important chemical concepts, engages students, helps develop their problem-solving skills, and exposes them to the uses of technology in chemistry."

During each visit students attend a one to two hour presentation by a scientist at the organization on topics related to those they are currently studying. Following the field trip students complete a collaborative project with classmates based on the scientific application they learned about. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its use of experiential learning to help students make the connection between the classroom and workplaces in their local community, thus developing a focus and purpose for their academic studies. The project is also having a direct impact on the large and diverse student body many of whom belong to disadvantaged socioeconomic groups. Moreover, the project activities are having an impact on the local and academic community through the partnerships forged between the faculty and their scientific or engineering counterparts in industry."
