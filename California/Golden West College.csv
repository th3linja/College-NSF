Wadhams DUE 9552379 Golden West College FY1995 $ 35,204 Huntington Beach, CA 92647 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Mathematics Title: The Golden West College Multimedia Classroom-Laboratory This project converts two traditional classrooms into Multimedia Classroom-Laboratories each equipped with two large screen monitors and a computer capable of running Macintosh and DOS software. This project also expands the Mathematics Department's existing Mathematica Computer-Lab from 16 to 25 stations in order to accommodate the anticipated increased usage. In addition to the initial target group of Precalculus and Calculus students, the use of the lab will be expanded to include Linear Algebra, Discrete Math, Statistics, and Math for Elementary Teachers. The use of cooperative learning activities and projects are the catalyst to transform students from observers to active learners capable of using technology to solve mathematical problems and implement mathematical models. Transforming the traditional classroom into the Multimedia Classroom-Laboratory addresses the need to use appropriate technology, projects, and increased student involvement on a daily basis to: modify the role of the student from observer to active learner; increase the effectiveness of learning activities by reducing student frustration in interfacing with the computers; enhance communication with both native and non-native English speakers; improve student problem solving and modeling skills; modify the instructor's role from lecturer to coach. Evaluation and dissemination include the formation of an advisory board for evaluation and a video tape for dissemination. An advisory board consisting of faculty in mathematics and other disciplines; representatives of High School, four year schools, selected local industries, and students will provide feedback on the appropriateness and effectiveness of the changes in the curriculum. The video tape is to demonstrate the Multimedia Classroom-Laboratory in action and is intended to communicate results to the teaching community."

Emphasis for the lecture packages will be placed on visually clear examples of experimental sequences, flow charts, and data that add dimension to a student's understanding of scientific processes. Analytical skills will be enhanced by numerous examples of experimental data presented first in raw form then displayed in a graphic or statistical manner that changes numbers into information. The strong visual support for these difficult concepts will help an under represented general student population understand scientific methodology. Unique features of Videoshow that contribute to the overall quality of the lecture products are its programmability, adaptability, ease of use, random access features, and quality of images. The addition of slide, print, and transparency makers to the system will increase versatility. Changes in student achievement will be evaluated and compared before and after implementation of the new program with results being reported both locally and nationally."

Laboratory exercises are designed to foster understanding of the scientific method and encourage critical thinking. Students are guided to consider accuracy, sensitivity and precision when using the equipment. Experiments to be performed include such student controlled exercises as a comparison of changes in student resting and exercising heart rates among smokers and non-smokers, and males and females.***//"
