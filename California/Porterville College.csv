The data will be processed and displayed by multimedia software to be written in Java to allow cross-platform and intenet usage. The displays will include an animated re-creation of the ride with vector diagiams attached to the moving cart, bar graphs showing scalar quantities such as potential and kinetic energy, and a synchronized video display. The program and data will be published on CD ROM with accompanying printed supplementary text. Also smaller related applets will be made available at the Porterville College web site. Access to the detailed inertial data for real roller coasters makes many physical phenomena accessible to investigation that would otherwise be subject to little more than speculation. This powerful tool allows classes to return from an amusement park event and continue the discovery process over the following weeks. During the initial phases, the program and data will be tested and evaluated in the physics, physical science, and calculus classes at Porterville College and in classes at the two local high schools."
