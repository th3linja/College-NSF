He is particularly interested in the application of this technique to the study of odd-mass and even-mass nuclei near closed shells. The equations of motion method has not lived up to its earlier promise because of problems related to backward going states and overcounting. In collaboration with Professor Klein of the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Rolnick plans to investigate these problems, so as to make the equations of motion method a more useful technique for studying many-fermion systems. Techniques for investigating the properties of many- particle systems are of great interest and importance. A technique of considerable promise and application, particularly in nuclear physics, is the equations of motion method. The planned research would resolve some of the difficulties limiting this approach, so that it will be more useful. The research experience gained by Dr. Rolnick will also assist him in this teaching and advising at Deep Springs College."

Small bats will primarily be used because they are uniquely suited for revealing the processes of ventilatory control under these conditions. The extreme energetic demands of flight provide a system in which to probe the upper limits of mammalian respiratory function. In addition, the ability of small bats to reduce their body temperature and metabolism through torpor permits the exploration of ventilatory control when operating in its most reduced extreme. Exploring ventilatory control processes in whole animals is often thwarted by the experimental process itself, because ventilatory control is subject to conscious override. However, a further advantage of torpor is that it provides a state in which ventilatory processes may be investigated free from conscious interference, thus assuring dependable data. Experiments will be performed using a variety of innovative techniques specially designed for bats. This study will help elucidate physiological control mechanisms regulating 1) unusually low and high metabolic states, 2) different patterns of ventilation, and 3) the adaptation to environmental changes. This investigation of undisturbed integrated function will also provide important corroboration of investigations that involve non-intact ventilatory components and more invasive techniques."
