The project involves design, implementation, and evaluation of an integrative curriculum for three cohorts of students enrolled in the designated general education biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy, geography, geology, and oceanography classes. Organized around the theme of oceanography, collaborative research projects and daily assignments are integrating industry-related curricula into introductory science courses and addressing career awareness and student interactions with the professional scientific community. The computer lab is bridging scientific theory with industry applications. The project is facilitating student learning in an open computer lab environment. It also provides a model for a four-part faculty enhancement program. Faculty have the opportunity to develop relationships with scientists and others in industry, integrate curriculum, and develop learning communities. A Teacher's Resource Guide and a train-the-trainer program are ensuring local and national project information dissemination."

Led by Palomar College in San Marcos, California in close collaboration with Southwestern College in Chula Vista, California, this project will serve to educate technicians for the high growth UAS industry in close collaboration with industry partners and other academic institutions.  Industry estimates project that the UAS industry will generate more than 100,000 jobs in various sectors, and generate economic impacts upward of $82 billion by 2025. California, and specifically San Diego, is home to the world's two leading UAS manufacturers and the demand is increasing for a workforce that specializes in the production of drone sensors, drone data analytics, and the development of UAS navigation technology for mapping and inspection applications.  Because there is a lack of UAS educational programs, local colleges and universities have been urged to focus on UAS technology to preserve San Diego's leadership in the industry. In response to industry demand for qualified UAS technicians and the need for UAS educational programs, Palomar College and Southwestern College along with their many industrial and educational partners will develop new academic programs and educational pathways to prepare the next generation of UAS technicians.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project brings together community college leaders in collaboration with partners from high school districts, universities, and various industry representatives to develop industry-specific UAS coursework. The project team will involve industry professionals and veteran experts to support curricular development, professional development for educators, student competency development, and outreach efforts.  Students will be prepared with not only UAS knowledge and skills, but also business and workplace acumen.  Summer academies will be hosted to excite underrepresented high school and college students about UAS educational and career pathways. This project will not only increase the number of skilled UAS technicians in the workforce, but also seeks to foster interest in UAS among faculty members and students from different disciplines. A Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) will also be developed as part of this project and will enable broad dissemination about the safe and novel applications of UAS to both the public and technical professionals.  Such dissemination has the potential to foster a responsible culture for UAS operations and building further excitement around UAS careers."

The project is focusing on improving the local geospatial infrastructure, thereby widening student access to advanced geospatial tools that are utilized by industry professionals. Moreover, the project is also fostering existing and developing new industry and service learning partnerships that are providing students with valuable opportunities to apply their classroom knowledge to solve real world problems. These partnerships are also providing students with opportunities to build valuable professional connections that are enhancing their employability and visibility in today's competitive job market. The project is also providing professional development to GIS and non-GIS educators. The weekend workshops funded by this project are introducing a diverse pool of non-GIS instructors to geospatial technology, and are also providing knowledge and skills needed to effectively transfer geospatial information and techniques to their students. The project is also providing professional development opportunities for project-related GIS instructors to learn about newly-developed geospatial tools and capabilities, and how to most effectively transfer these new tools and techniques to students enrolled in their courses. Finally, this project is also creating model education pathways to enhance student interest in geospatial technology. Specifically, new programs and curriculum are being developed at the university, college, and high school levels, all of which are enabling students to seamlessly transition from one level to the next. Consequently, the outreach events supported by this project are increasing the diversity of students and community members who are interested in this advanced technological field."

Preliminary laboratory materials were developed for teaching one section of College Algebra and one section of Calculus I with a computer laboratory component during the spring 1992 semester. This project is providing the resources to continue that curriculum development and expand to other College Algebra, Precalculus, and Calculus I sections. Macintosh computers and associated peripherals are being used to provide a laboratory component for College Algebra, Precalculus, and Calculus I courses offered by the college. The computers are empowering students to simultaneously represent functions in numeric, symbolic and graphic form. Students can visualize mathematical concepts without the need for excessive preliminary concentration on rote manipulation. Students concentrate on learning concepts through guided discovery, using problem solving strategies, and becoming familiar with how mathematics is done outside the classroom. The laboratory environment is requiring students to work collaboratively and write about the mathematics they are learning."
