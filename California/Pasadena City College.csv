Based on the effective practices demonstrated at the university level, the eCURe project seeks to use undergraduate research as a platform for engaging students in STEM education, promoting STEM careers, improving STEM skills training and enhancing critical thinking. More specifically, the project will be investigating how early research experiences for community college students lead to improved success and retention in their STEM academic path. This program, in collaboration with four-year institutions and industry partners, will create an employer-driven accelerated contextualized STEM pathway that provides more research-like experiences on a community college campus via redesigned curriculum and instructional methodology, and lead to summer internships for students at partner institutions. This project will allow underrepresented and economically disadvantaged students from the community college to have a similar experience as their counterparts at four year schools. These early research experiences will better prepare these students for both the workforce and transfer. This project will develop model curriculum that can be adopted at other community colleges and lead to increased diversity in the STEM fields. <br/><br/>The eCURe model includes purposeful redesign of STEM curriculum, including the scaffolding of research knowledge and skills across multiple STEM disciplines. Furthermore, the model will develop three levels of research experiences beginning with research exposure and building to full research internships similar to the National Science Foundation's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) model.  The incorporation of current research methods into introductory level STEM course work is unique at the community college level and the eCURe project will serve as a national model for building research capacity in two-year programs. Providing community college students with authentic research training and experiences within industry, government and university laboratories promises to increase real-world applied skills in STEM students. The eCURe project will serve as a pilot for determining the most effective means of providing STEM education that include required research knowledge and skills. The size and diversity of Pasadena City College makes it a prime candidate to adopt such a project and to serve as an exemplar for other community colleges throughout the nation. The project has been developed with a broad intent to ensure the ability to replicate the model at other institutions."

For example, micro- and nanotechnology is used to make components of electronic devices such as computers, cell phones, wearable activity monitors, and medical sensors.  It is also used to improve products, such as making tennis balls that last longer, cloth that repels water, and bandages that prevent bacterial growth.  As micro- and nanotechnologies are increasingly used to improve products and create new ones, micro- and nanotechnology industries are expected to experience double-digit growth into the foreseeable future.  Consequently, a highly skilled technical workforce is needed to keep pace with the demands of and the changes in micro- and nanotechnology industries.  To support preparation of this workforce across the United States, this project will establish and support the NSF Advanced Technological Education Program?s Micro Nano Technology Education Center (MNT-EC). The MNT-EC will directly increase the numbers of community college faculty participating in micro- and nanotechnology technician education, thus supporting an increased number of students who receive technical education degrees and certificates in micro- and nanotechnology fields.  As a result, this project will support preparation of a skilled technical workforce in a field that has enormous impact on the nation?s economy, security, and health. <br/><br/>This project will be led by Pasadena City College in collaboration with Edmonds Community College, Portland Community College, and Northwest Vista College. In addition, the MNT-EC will connect existing micro and nano NSF ATE Resource Centers (NACK, SCME, NEATEC, and MatEdu).  As a result, MNT-EC will leverage a broad set of expertise to prepare a nationwide skilled technical workforce for manufacture of micro and nano products. Each member of the MNT-EC will bring resources, such as cleanrooms, educational materials, and remote operation of lab instruments, to support and inform the development of a common curriculum for associate degrees and certificates in micro nano technologies. The content of this curriculum will be informed by the needs of industry members and be updated via annual reviews between academic and industry members. The faculty of the academic institutions will remain current in micro- and nanotechnology innovations via periodic workshops or webinars across the various specializations (such as safety, fabrication, operations) provided by the academic and industry members. The MNT-EC will map where the micro- and nanotechnology industry is greatest and where it is growing and promote adaptation of the MNT-EC curriculum at regional two-year institutions near these locations. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is  compounded by poor college preparation, bad study habits,  inadequate writing skills, limited economic resources, and great  variability in concept comprehension. Teaching such students  requires that the material be presented in an engaging fashion that  allows immediate grasp of principles regardless of the students'  background. This project aims to achieve these objectives and to  increase student retention and interest in scientific careers by  integrating computer visualization and simulation into a core of  introductory science courses: a new interdisciplinary course in  physical science and biology (Introduction to Environmental  Science), 3 introductory chemistry courses, and 2 introductory  geology courses. Customized courseware developed in the  NEXTSTEP-486 programming environment will utilize equipment  purchased with a recently awarded NSF-ILI (Instrumentation and  Laboratory Improvement) grant to one of the principal  investigators. These applications together with courseware that has  already been developed by the PIs will be used to illustrate  abstract concepts and model complex natural phenomena. Students  will explore the effect of changing parameters on a variety of such  systems. Pre-lab computer simulations will familiarize students  with equipment and laboratory protocols before performing  experiments thereby instilling confidence and facilitating  exploration and ""discovery"". Powerful multimedia capabilities will  be utilized to the fullest by incorporating sound, full color high  resolution images and video into the applications. Students will  use the Internet to access scientific data from public archives and  bulletin boards and communicate with peers at other campuses thus  providing a sense of connection to the  broader scientific  community. The proposed curricular improvements will raise  retention rates, attract more students to scientific careers, and  increase overall scientific literacy among students from  populations grossly underrepresented among professional scientists."

Its influence on the behavior of the transform fault is thus of first-order importance and may represent one of the most important complications in developing a comprehensive understanding of how strike-slip faults and plate boundaries behave. With this in mind, the PI's propose a collaborative study that will systematically and quantitatively integrate geological constraints on the manner in which transpressional deformation is accommodated at several sites along the San Andreas fault. A functional understanding of transpression would make patterns of vertical deformation easy to predict where primary boundary conditions, such as the degree of plate motion obliquity and the mechanics of the main transform fault, are known. However, the material properties of the San Andreas fault are debated, and considerable evidence suggests that secondary factors (structural and lithologic heterogeneity, erosivity) play a significant role in shaping the geologic response to transpression. As a result, a general understanding of how transpressional plate motion becomes manifest as deformation in the crust has not been developed. One of the PI's objectives is to quantitatively evaluate the effects of external factors on deformation partitioning, so that we may ultimately evaluate models of transpressional deformation that are predicated on assumptions of the mechanical properties of the San Andreas fault. Their approach will be to use the spatial and temporal distribution of vertical motion, manifested in bedrock uplift (surface uplift + exhumation), as a representation of transpression. They will combine thermochronologic constraints ((U-Th)/He dating) on the age and magnitude of exhumation with geomorphic and structural constraints on surface uplift, erosion, and the architecture of deformation that drives this bedrock uplift. They will use these complementary techniques to determine how patterns of vertical motion are spatially distributed with respect to the San Andreas fault (i.e. near vs. far field) and its obliquity to plate motion. The PI's objective is thus to develop a functional relationship between transpressive deformation and these key variables. This will require developing controls on how the chronology of vertical motion relates to the emergence of transpression at each site as well as controls on the effects of independent boundary conditions (e.g. geological, structural, climatic) along strike. They will focus on four sites (Carrizo Plain/Temblor Range, San Emigdio Mountains, northern San Gabriel Mountains, and Coachella Valley), each of which represents a major gap in understanding of transpression along the San Andreas fault. The integrated results from these sites, when synthesized with previous studies, will provide the full range in boundary conditions and transpressive parameters needed to create specific tests of<br/>different models of transpressional deformation. A key aspect of this proposal is the collaboration that will be employed in attaining our goal. The PI's have extensive knowledge of southern California geology and the analytical techniques to be employed. Spotila was among the first to apply this type of integrated approach to understanding portions of the Transverse Ranges. House has actively pursued new applications of the thermochronologic technique that will be employed in this study. Brady provides a robust foundation in structural geology and geophysics that will link uplift estimates with individual structures. Post-doctoral associate Niemi will add an additional expertise in Cenozoic stratigraphy, structural geology, and field mapping. This number of PI's will also enable us to begin work at all field sites concurrently and represents a science team strong enough to tackle this significant problem.<br/>"
