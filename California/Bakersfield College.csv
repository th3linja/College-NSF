Scholars are being supported by academic and professional development programming; a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) service learning course; faculty mentors; and transfer advisement. Scholars are being recruited through local events, faculty outreach, student services, and electronic communications.<br/><br/>The college is a Hispanic-Serving Institution educating a significant number of women, minority, low-income, and first-generation college students. The objective of this project is to increase persistence, success, timely transfer, and professional skills, especially among underrepresented STEM students. Scholarships reduce the hours students must work to financially support themselves or their families, allowing them to complete their studies within three years, transfer to earn a baccalaureate degree, and enter the workforce.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project is founded upon best practices in engagement and persistence, specifically tailored to the local student population. The project is achieving its goals by using faculty mentors who lead student cohorts, success programing and industry visits, dedicated support from student services, and a STEM centered service learning course. The service learning course is based on a substantial literature base on the positive effects of service learning on underrepresented students. The project team is academically well-qualified and experienced to implement the project, representing all STEM disciplines plus student services. In addition, industry and community partners are actively involved in the project and have committed support.  <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project is creating a replicable model scholarship program that utilizes transfer and industry partners to help STEM students succeed, especially underrepresented groups. Findings are being disseminated locally and nationally via webinars, a college hosted workshop, and the web. The project is to increase the number of underrepresented minorities and women achieving STEM degrees and entering the workforce, thus bolstering the competitiveness of the United States in a global economy."

The program was developed along NSE recommendations, will operate with Tech Prep programs in local high schools and culminate with required internships at industrial locations. Articulation of the core courses with 4-year colleges and universities will provide students with additional degree and/or career options. Valuable input and direction were received from individuals in successful biotechnology programs at other California community colleges, the Southern and Central California Biotechnology Centers, several transfer institutions and local industries. The program involves cooperative teaching by chemistry, agriculture and biology faculty. Collectively, these departments serve more than 1,300 students annually who might benefit from the biotechnology program.  The Science and Engineering facilities are scheduled for safety upgrade renovations to begin in January, 1998, and plans include converting one laboratory for biotechnology. However, without external finding the start of the program will be delayed. The equipment needs for such a program include  electrophoresis, thermocycler, rotary shaker(s), micropipets, refrigerated micro-centrifuge. Funding of this project will provide students with increased hands-on learning meaningful to transfer requirements, more diversified student choices beyond the impacted allied health programs now available, and comprehensive problem-solving activities in traditional courses."

This is                 allowing all students in a full laboratory section to perform                   experiments requiring extensive measurements from these instruments.            The new instruments are allowing the curriculum to include experiments          which establish the formula of complex ions, rates of dissociation of           complexes, kinetic rate laws for the bromination of acetone, and other          appropriate quantitative experiments.  A second infrared                        spectrophotometer is also being added.  This is allowing the organic            laboratory students to increase their routine analysis of starting              materials and synthesis products.  It is also facilitating the                  introduction of infrared analysis into the general chemistry laboratory                                                                                         sections which are currently too large to be served by a single                 instruments.  An example of a new experiment, which has been added is a         study of the bonding in ligands of a cobalt (III) complex.
