By reducing financial barriers, the college is augmenting retention and increasing persistence through several proven techniques.<br/><br/>STARRS scholars are attending full-time, working less hours at jobs, meeting regularly with faculty mentors, and participating in the college's Math, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) and/or TRiO Student Support Services STEM (SSS) programs.  These students have access to the MESA Center and careful advising to support their personal educational plans. In addition they have priority registration to implement a clustering into the same sections of mathematics and science courses, regular contact with the MESA/SSS STEM Director and the Educational Advisor, financial literacy education, and support for additional scholarship and internship applications.<br/><br/>STARRS students are encouraged to attend Academic Excellence Workshops led by student-peer facilitators to help them excel in mathematics, physics and chemistry courses, and they can utilize drop-in tutoring in mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology in the MESA Center. One-on-one tutoring is freely available for students who are identified by an early alert system. S-STEM scholars may attend transfer conferences, tours of four-year colleges, universities, and local industry employers, and they are eligible to apply for all-expenses-paid travel to meetings of professional societies.<br/><br/>This program has the innovative feature that scholarship amounts are determined by the number of science and mathematics courses in which the student enrolls during the next academic year.  Applicants must show residency, be a STEM major, show financial need, demonstrate academic merit, and submit an essay describing academic goals and how the scholarship will enable them to reduce the number of work hours. Results from these innovative scholarship features are being disseminated through conferences and the college's website."

Located in Southern California, Rio Hondo College is a public, two-year, Hispanic-serving institution. More than 55% of its students are classified as low-income, first-generation college students. Over its five-year duration, this project will fund two-year scholarships to 45 students who are pursuing associate degrees for transfer in Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Sciences, Engineering, Mathematics, and Physics. The project aims to increase student persistence in STEM fields by providing financial support, combined with efforts to analyze and support the success of low-income STEM students. The project will include a ""Thrive as a Scientist"" course, along with support activities such as mentoring/tutoring, undergraduate research experiences, and curricular improvements. This multi-faceted approach is expected to help Scholars acquire a STEM identity that can carry them throughout their college and professional careers. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. Current theory about the development of science identity offers a framework to investigate how science identity and cultural identity affect student agency, and what college structures support this development. Unfortunately, most measurement tools related to development of STEM identity were created by four-year institutions for students enrolled in four-year degree programs. Considering the increasing number of underrepresented minority students who begin their post-secondary education at a community college, a pressing need exists to better understand STEM identity development at two-year institutions. This project will help to address this need by using a culturally-sensitive STEM identity instrument to measure and address the barriers and opportunities facing STEM students at two-year colleges.  The results will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, and to advance understanding of the effects of cultural and STEM identity as students complete their courses of study at two-year institutions, and graduate and/or transfer to four-year institutions in STEM fields. With an emphasis on the two-year college setting, the results of this project will add to the discourse in STEM education with a renewed focus on not just changing student behaviors but also chancing the culture of institutions in which they are enrolled. The project will evaluate the effectiveness of each of the project's components and will publish results of the knowledge generated in education and social science journals, and disseminate findings at regional and national meetings to broaden the impact of the project. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields.  It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will build on the expertise and partnerships the institution has developed with local schools, companies, Workforce Investment Boards (WIB's), the State of California Employment Development Department (EDD), the Governor's Green Team, and the California Energy Commission. It will create and evaluate improved models for work-based learning tools to assure students are more successful and to increase diversity in the technical work force. The project will integrate high-performance electronics, computer management skills, and advanced technology diagnostic skills that make students highly employable while assisting the diverse high school population in the service area served by the college. It will encourage students to continue their education and attain two and four year technology degrees. <br/><br/>The project will develop a clear and defined pathway that will allow articulated high school students from diverse backgrounds to enter a new form of automobile and energy technician training. It will also create the career pathway to an Associate of Science degree that is transferable to articulated universities in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) areas of Mechanical Engineering or Electrical Engineering, degrees not commonly associated with the automobile technician in the past. The project will integrate a high-performance STEM based energy curriculum using innovative teaching strategies at the college and  high school and university partners. It will track students in the new Hybrid/Electric/Fuel-Cell Technician program to assure that they graduate with sufficient learning and work experience to qualify for employment as an Electric/Hybrid/ Fuel-Cell Technician and will use manufacturers' supported industry certifications and technical training for faculty. Industrial partners will provide internships and supervised work experience for technicians that allow graduates to be successful when they secure employment. The project will demonstrate significant improvement in the STEM learning using interdisciplinary and applied approaches to areas of Career and Technical Education (CTE). Problem solving and technical skills will be enhanced by this curriculum as it will integrate work-based skills, clearly defined career pathways, and stackable certificates that industry demands from employees. A Summer Energy Academy for 13 year old students brings teachers and students together to build and test the latest alternative energy technology."
