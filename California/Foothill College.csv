BARRnet is the midlevel network located in the Bay Area of California. It will provide operations management and information services and it will give Foothill-DeAnza Colleges a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. The Colleges needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore innovative educational resources."

(CCITT), Foothill College is planning and holding eight regional summer workshops during two consecutive years for faculty from community colleges and senior institutions. The workshops are providing faculty with training in four technologies: remote sensing/image processing (RS/IP) and geographic information systems/geographic positioning systems (GIS/GPS). The project is serving approximately 180 individual faculty over the course of the project. The project's objectives are as follows: To train undergraduate faculty in the use of RS/IP and GIS/GPS using curriculum modules developed by CCITT. To develop additional curriculum modules integrating the four technologies into each participant's instructional area. To instruct faculty in the use of the Internet and its resources in developing curriculum using the four technologies. To develop an awareness of leading edge ideas and applications that are reshaping the disciplines through these technologies. To adapt and disseminate the curriculum modules developed by the undergraduate faculty participants on the national, regional and local level. To increase the level of communication and cooperation among participants while developing curricula at their home institutions."

In active partnership with local industry, the project is first developing an on-line infrastructure that permits industrial partners to participate in the development of biotechnology instruction; this infrastructure is then being utilized to develop three casebooks containing six industry-based teaching cases that help students in biotechnology programs gain practical insights into the skills required for research and development, intellectual property, manufacturing, production, quality assurance/quality control, and clinical studies. These materials are being used in classrooms at the high school, community college, and university levels with over l OO,OOO students nationwide and are suitable for use within industry employee training programs. This project addresses the two most significant shortcomings in contemporary biotechnology education programs: a lack of active involvement from industry participants in the instructional process itself, and a dearth of high quality biotechnology education curriculum materials. The unique time and resource limitations that characterize the workforce of young biotechnology companies make it necessary to explore a variety of methods for getting industry involvement and buy-in into the biotechnology education process. Core partners in this effort include representatives from industry and education. By preparing students with the requisite biotechnology workplace skills--beyond biotechnology content knowledge--the project's materials promote a wide range of career opportunities in the field for high school, community college, and university students nationwide."

First, existing resources pertaining to Earth system education are being collected into a broad ""works in progress"" collection. Second, metadata are associated with each resource, to facilitate discovery by end users. Third, a ""community review"" system is being created to evaluate resources for pedagogical effectiveness, ease of use for faculty and students, and power to motivate and inspire students. This step enables identification of the best of the collected resources, which are then placed in a smaller high-quality ""reviewed"" area. Finally, assessment of both the reviewed and unreviewed collections is taking place, to ensure they are well-balanced and meet the needs of the user community. Partners in the collaboration are the American Geological Institute, Columbia University, Dartmouth College, and Foothill-DeAnza Community College. This project has responsibility for the resource acquisition component."

For the existing collection, data are being compiled on learning context (grade level), topic, type of learning resource, cost to user, geographic distribution of resources focusing on a particular locality, and temporal distribution of resources focusing on a particular slice of geologic time. For the ""desired collection,"" data area being compiled on search and browse requests made through the Discovery System. Changes over time of both the existing collection and the desired collection are being documented and compared. The second task is building on a prior NSF award supporting a resource gathering effort in Earth and environmental science to build a starter-collection with at least a few resources of interest to a wide range of potential DLESE users. This collections gathering effort is guided by the Collections Assessment, focusing on filling identified gaps or thin spots in the collection, seeking to avoid a ""lumpy"" collection rich only in those areas collected by specific interest groups. The third task is the cataloging of resources and is being done by the group responsible for the GeoRef catalog of professional literature in the geosciences. The fourth task is the further development and implementation of the Community Review System. The DLESE Community Review System solicits web-based feedback from educators who have used the resource with their learners, and combines it with expert reviews to evaluate resources against a set of seven selection criteria. The scope and breadth of the Reviewed Collection is increasing and Reviewed Collection resources are being showcased. Indices based on information gathered during the review process are being shared with potential resource users, along with editor's comments and teaching tips contributed by users, via an NSDL-style ""annotation service."" In addition to building the DLESE Collection, this project is contributing to the broader NSDL in several areas of collection development practice and research: methodologies for collections assessment in a digital world, incorporation of collections assessment into digital library evaluation, identification of resources proven effective in challenging and learning and teaching situations, implementation of a community-based review system, and use of an annotation system to disseminate information about educational resources. Significant co-funding of this project is being provided by the Division of Earth Sciences in the NSF Directorate for Geosciences in recognition of the importance that this collection and related activities have for K-12 teachers and undergraduate faculty."

The laboratory is connected through the ethernet to the main laboratory supporting the rest of our two-year transfer and vocational programs. The main laboratory is in the process of being partially updated through the use of severely limited, state-provided, one-time funds connected to the construction of a new Advanced Technology Center on campus, which will provide laboratories for video, computing, engineering and manufacturing technologies. The 22 station laboratory described in this project is a detachable network with 22 Sun ClassicLX workstations, a Sun Sparcsystem 10 model 40 to connect the workstations to our main laboratory network, and appropriate software needed by our advanced students to teach UNIX systems administration, UNIX systems programming, networking in a UNIX environment, UNIX shell programming, object-oriented programming in a development environment, GUI programming, and 3D graphics programming."
