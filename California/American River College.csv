Twelve Macintosh SE  computers are being removed from the existing department network  and used in the laboratory with Vernier Serial Box Interface kits  for data acquisition.   Twelve new Macintosh Quadra 630s are  replacing the SEs on the network.   Upgrading the network  provides students access to computers powerful enough to run new  statistical software to be used for data analysis and simulation  and to additional Internet services.   CAI software is also  available on the network.   The success of the project is being  measured by student and instructor evaluations comparing  interfaced versus non-interfaced laboratory exercises and by  student and instructor evaluations of the CAI and statistical  software.   In addition to publications and conference  presentations, the investigators are holding a series of  workshops on computer interfaced laboratory exercises for local  high school and middle school science teachers and also for  at-risk high school students."

This is happening by upgrading Chemnet (Chemistry CAI) with more powerful computers and printers that have more capabilities and chemical applications for handling and manipulating data. The freshman students are learning to store data on text files, carry the text files to Chemnet, and transfer the files into Chemnet for data evaluation, printing and plotting. Students are also using a computer to control the variables of the experiment and the UV-Visible spectrophotometer and then transfer the data electronically with Chemnet. The students are also using the computers with other accessories to learn additional laboratory techniques. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal funds."
