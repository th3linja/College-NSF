"1104074","Mother Lode Region Multimedia Technician (MLMT) Project","DUE","ADVANCED TECH EDUCATION PROG","07/01/2011","07/01/2011","Gary Mendenhall","CA","Yosemite Community College District","Standard Grant","Elizabeth Teles","06/30/2014","$200,000.00","Melissa Colon","mendenhallg@yosemite.edu","P.O. Box 4065","Modesto","CA","953524065","2095756961","EHR","7412","1032, 9178, SMET","$0.00","This college is developing a multimedia career pathway to prepare students with the skills and education necessary to advance in careers as multimedia technicians. The college has the long-term vision of providing a comprehensive set of multifaceted career pathways that connect students beginning at the K-12 level to higher education programs and ultimately to jobs in the Information Communications and Technologies (ICT) industry. The project consists of 3 components: <br/>(1) Collaboration with local K-12 school districts throughout the Mother Lode region (with a focus on grades 6-12), including shared training opportunities and video broadcasting laboratory space that is designed to build a pipeline of students to enroll in multimedia courses at the college and to place college students in service-learning projects at various school sites. <br/>(2) Development of a Multimedia Technician Certificate Program at the college that can be modeled by other community colleges, particularly those located in rural areas. <br/>(3) Expanded business/industry relationships to create student externships and job placements. <br/><br/>The primary populations to be served are two-year community college students, however, training for college faculty and staff, as well as K-12 teachers and staff, is being conducted. A Multimedia Advisory Committee that includes college faculty and staff, students, K-12 teachers and counselors, and representatives from private industry/businesses that employ multimedia technicians is being formed to provide project oversight.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project is improving student learning in the multimedia field by developing a model multimedia career pathway that incorporates K-12 and business/industry partnerships, as well as best practices and pedagogical research findings throughout the broader ICT field. Project staff are collaborating with the regional ATE-funded ICT Center (Mid Pacific ICT), and hosting trainings on campus for faculty and K-12 teachers in the Mother Lode Region, thus utilizing the resources and expertise from other NSF-funded programs. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project is impacting students, staff, and the surrounding community by raising awareness and interest in multimedia technician careers; providing multimedia services through student internships, externships, and service-learning projects; and ultimately providing a greater number of rural technicians to meet workforce demands. To disseminate the model developed to other community colleges, the college is participating in various state and national conferences and forums, developing a student-driven webpage to house resources and model materials, and participating in other NSF-funded projects and ATE Center activities."

Current work with faculty in post-secondary agriculture education programs throughout California is being leveraged for this project. Programs in five neighboring states (Nevada, Arizona, Oregon, Idaho, and Washington) are being explored to determine the geographic area that will best be served by a regional agriculture center on the West Coast. The project is: 1) Assessing the strengths and needs of community college and university agriculture education programs in delivering pre-service and in-service preparation for agriculture teachers within the region; 2) Developing plans for core center activities that support agriculture programs and agriculture science and technology instructors; and 3) Developing a research agenda for agriculture graduate students to conduct in-depth studies of issues pertinent to agriculture educators. Special attention is given to pedagogy and support for students, including minorities, who have not typically pursued Agriculture Education as a career. Finally, the essential community college link between high school and university education is strengthened through the creation of a collaborative, centralized regional center."

Specific outreach efforts are made to traditionally underrepresented students and students pursuing a career in Agriculture Education. Scholarships are awarded through a competitive process based on financial need, GPA, essay, interview, and recommendation. Recipients receive support services through cohort-based activities such as faculty mentoring, advising, leadership training, social activities, professional development opportunities, and an intensive Agriculture Summer Institute. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The program is preparing highly-educated future Agricultural Science professionals such as agriculture economists, farm owners and engineers, technicians, and future teachers. Students receive training to become mentors for future cohorts, creating a network of peers and increasing further collaborative opportunities. The programmatic structure of this program serves as a model for other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) based courses of study throughout the college, as well as in other institutions."

The curriculum is designed and implemented in consultation with the Agriculture Education Steering Committee, comprised of MJC faculty, 13 area high schools, and representatives from the 5 partnering California State University Agriculture Programs. An Associate of Science degree is to be submitted to the State in Agricultural Science. Additionally, specific strategies are researched and implemented for recruiting, retaining and supporting future Agriculture Education students. These methods include program presentations, print and digital media, on-going communication with high school teachers and counselors, and a state-wide database. Special attention is given to approaches for students, including minorities, who have not typically pursued Agriculture as a career. Toward this end, an Agriculture Education Pathway Scholarship program is established, and a cohort approach to coursework is implemented, including an advising and mentoring component, cohort leadership training, and a Summer Institute for student success."

To address this need, Modesto Junior College (MJC) will implement an Agriculture Irrigation Technology program.  The project will increase the number, and improve the preparation and technical expertise of irrigation technicians and designers who are prepared to improve agriculture water management, increase irrigation delivery system efficiency, and enhance on-farm water conservation. Three specific objectives support the goal of the program: 1) Develop and deliver standardized curriculum that advances the efficient design and use of irrigation systems and can be replicated at other institutions; 2) Create a pipeline of skilled, certified technicians that meet current conservation, efficiency and water management regulations; and 3) Increase recruitment and success rates for underrepresented students in agricultural science technical programs.<br/><br/>Specific activities will include development of a new associate degree, an Irrigation Technology Summer Institute to increase the recruitment and retention of typically underrepresented students in this field, on-site student advising, hands-on experience with state-of-the-art technology, and industry internships. A new curriculum will combine a strong foundation in science, including critical components of plant science, soil science, hydrology, and meteorology with cutting edge technology that enables workers to accurately put water when and where it is needed. This program is contributing to the improvement of student learning and preparation in multiple agricultural science areas, and has relevance for animal science, plant and crop science, environmental horticulture, as well as other agriculture disciplines."
