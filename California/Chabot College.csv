Students taking general human anatomy, human physiology, and more advanced anatomy and physiology, use these required courses towards their ultimate goal of completing vocational and technological schooling. Students  learn by cultivating hands-on skills through finely-tuned contemporary course laboratory work and interaction with advanced computerized technology. New exercises, for example, are being introduced in pulse oximetry,  oxygen and hemoglobin dissociation curves, ECG and EMG studies, actual cadaver dissection, computer-guided and simulated dissections, and programmed histological studies."
