The primary goal of the project will be to retain students in STEM disciplines so that they are prepared to transfer to four-year institutions to continue their education. Towards that end scholars will be supported for up to three years of study with a scholarship amount of up to $7,000.  New agreements with the California State University system will provide an easy path of transfer from two-year to local four-year institutions offering degrees.  The project team will work with local and regional industrial concerns, and other educational institutions to secure industry internships and research internships to provide the S-STEM scholars with additional applied experiences and career pathways.<br/><br/>The recruitment plan will include the SBCC counselor visiting each local high school to meet with students and counselors for recruitment of talented students. Upon being accepted, each student develops an educational plan that will enable them to complete their educational program. SBCC sets high standards for students and a detailed student support plan, grounded in the applicable research literature, will serve the scholars effectively through the delivery of strong support services (e.g. working as tutors, research experiences, and internships). A major strength of this project is the depth and breadth of the management team consisting of STEM faculty and staff members who are committed to ensuring the academic success of students. The diverse team includes several STEM faculty, one administrator, the director of financial aid, the local coordinator of the nation-wide Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement Program, three advising and counseling staff, and an SBCC Foundation staff member. Broad faculty support is evidenced in the plan for project implementation which also has the backing of the President of SBCC and the Executive Director of the SBCC Foundation. The Director of Institutional Assessment, Research, and Planning will be responsible for conducting the project evaluation, carrying out both formative and summative components. Formative evaluation data supplemented with student learning outcomes assessment data will inform the summative evaluation of the final project impact.  Dissemination will occur both within the institution and externally through sharing the results of the project at faculty and staff development meetings and with student groups as well as the other colleges and, at conferences, including the annual Student Success Conference, sponsored by the California Research and Planning Group."

Micro-content includes news, video, music, games, and supplemental educational materials specifically designed for personal electronic devices.  This three year project is supporting the courses and staff development necessary to build a concentration for students who are learning to author, integrate and distribute forms of digital content for mobile deployment.<br/><br/>The curriculum serves incoming high school and community college students, four-year university transfer students, and incumbent workers in the computer technology field. The implementation process includes developing appropriate curriculum with a hands-on internship lab component, developing partnerships with industry, and providing faculty and staff training in the new format. <br/>"
