The goal is to improve core mathematics and science education in an effort to better prepare remedial two-year college students for higher-level coursework and careers in technical fields. Instructional innovations integrate basic mathematics, elementary algebra, introductory physics, and basic reading, writing, and study skills. Activities include curriculum adaptation and implementation, industry field experiences for community college faculty and students, and professional development opportunities for regional community college instructors and K-12 teachers.<br/><br/>At its heart, this project remedies basic skill deficits and fosters motivation for the pursuit of technical careers among a regional student population increasingly under-prepared for college-level work in mathematics and science. To accomplish this mission, this three year effort: 1) establishes a year-long interdisciplinary mathematics and science learning community for developmental two-year college students that emphasizes problem solving and collaborative learning strategies; 2) integrates faculty internships and hands-on class projects into the curriculum to ensure workplace relevancy and enhance student motivation; and 3) facilitates regional training and dialogue activities for K-12 teachers and community college faculty, with an emphasis on interdisciplinary teaching methods, technology applications, and success strategies for underrepresented students.<br/><br/>Chabot College has established critical partnerships with the University of California, Davis, Edward Teller Education Center (ETEC), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), and the Hayward Unified School District to support this initiative. ETEC and the national laboratories actively participate in curriculum modifications, faculty internships, and hands-on student class projects in robotics, optics, and laser technologies. Additionally, ETEC and the Hayward Unified School District collaborate on the project's faculty enhancement activities. <br/>The project's underlying mission is to increase students' educational and career options through challenging, applications-oriented curriculum. Working collaboratively, this project revitalizes core mathematics and science education at Chabot College and serves as a model for developmental reform efforts."

Throughout its 5 years, this project will fund 80 scholarships for students who are pursuing associate degrees or intend to transfer to a baccalaureate degree in the STEM disciplines of biological sciences, computer science, engineering, mathematics and/or physical sciences. Each Scholar will receive: an individualized education plan with follow-up and academic monitoring services; priority enrollment for Fast Track accelerated transfer math courses (a compressed course of gatekeeper transfer-level math courses); STEM supplemental instruction (SI) and tutoring; one-on-one faculty mentoring; enrichment activities including college and industry tours, social events and STEM student clubs; and priority consideration for internship opportunities. <br/><br/>The Chabot MESA Fast Track Scholars Program supports students through challenging attrition points on their STEM pathway, including the gateway transfer-level mathematics course sequence. Community colleges have a critical role to play in increasing STEM degree attainment by students traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. Long course sequences in mathematics can be a barrier to timely completion of the degree. Thus, the reform of such course sequences in mathematics, to improve both time to completion and rate of completion, is of great significance both statewide and nationally. Project goals focus on improving student success by: 1) increasing Fast Track math course success; 2) increasing persistence in students' STEM major; 3) increasing the percentage of STEM students who earn an AA/AS degree and/or transfer; and 4) decreasing the amount of time to earn a degree and/or transfer to a baccalaureate STEM degree program. A comparative research study will examine the effect of Fast Track courses on math course success, retention, and timely STEM degree/transfer attainment over the 5-year project period when compared to students enrolled in the traditional mathematics sequence. This project will investigate factors that decrease attrition rates of STEM majors including challenging transfer-level math courses. The study will also advance the understanding of whether accelerated math sequences contribute to decreasing time to degree/transfer completion with the potential to inform the scaling up of these accelerated courses at other community colleges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One human cadaver is used by almost five hundred students. A student success rate of about 60% over the past five years and loss of specific groups of students within the three course health science sequence is an indication that we are not meeting the special needs of some of out students. Some steps have been taken to address these issues including implementation of prerequisites for the course and a planned purchase of six computers and software to be shared by physiology and anatomy students. In addition, the college has agreed to purchase three computers and sets of software for exclusive use by anatomy students. The proposed project takes the next step. The objectives of this project are to increase student retention and success in the anatomy course by making instruction as concise and direct as possible and by offering more opportunities for individualized instruction, increasing access to the Internet to promote student-based experimental inquiry, replacing cat dissection with computerized and cadaver dissection, and by enhancing histological studies with computerized micrographs. The equipment needed to enable us to meet out objectives includes 5 Pentium computers with carts and security packages, 5 sets of CD-ROM software, and a LEICA-EWS software program."

It will do so by developing new lab modules based on industry-recognized skills for each course in the biology major sequence.  Students will be able to earn badges that certify their mastery of each workforce-relevant skill. Accumulation of badges will lead to Certificates of Completion, which will provide concise information about a student's proficiencies. This approach incorporates technician education into a traditional biology program that has a current focus on preparation of its graduates for transfer into four-year institutions.  By expanding the program focus to include preparation of students for technical careers, this approach is intended to address an important workforce need in the San Francisco Bay Area.  This new pathway is expected to open the biotechnology program to more students and to promote completion of the entire biology major sequence as students accumulate critical workforce skills. Because the college serves a large Latinx student population, this approach is likely to contribute to broadening participation in the biotechnology field. The project has the potential to provide a novel model that might be replicated by academic biology programs interested in meeting local workforce needs for biotechnology technicians.<br/> <br/>To achieve its goal of embedding relevant technician education into the biology program, the project will develop lab modules and badge requirements in collaboration with local biotechnology industry partners. With input from the advisory board and local industry surveys, the project has identified needed technical skills. These skills, such as micropipetting, DNA and protein extraction and purification, and enzyme-linked immunoassay, will be the foundation of the modules and badges. The lab modules will become part of each course, thereby ensuring that all students develop biotechnology skills. Although the badges will not be required, they will be strongly recommended, especially for students considering temporary or career-long work as technicians in the local workforce. Badging will support many students by providing a pathway of incremental and achievable steps embedded in course completion. Pairing badges with in-class career-development activities and providing industry examples (through speaker series and other events) will provide a new, clear career pathway into biotechnology within the existing biology major. In addition to developing the labs and badges, the project will support technician-level biotechnology education with targeted recruiting at the college and the local high schools, and by collaborating with employers to secure paid internships and job placements. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
