The goals of the project are to encourage underrepresented high school and community college students to pursue careers in GIS, and to provide a ladder of certification and education that enable students to work in GIS-related positions while pursuing further training and education.  The Consortium is developing GIS skills certifications, designed to meet industry and employer needs, that can be combined to provide an articulated educational program. These certificates build on each other and feed into an associate's degree in GIS for more comprehensive technical training, a bachelor's degree, and advanced degrees in the field.  The Consortium is developing a standards-based curriculum aligned across the three educational levels, including Web-based introductory programs in GIS to encourage students to pursue careers in the field and enhance enrollment in technician training and educational programs. The Co-PIs are creating articulation agreements that ensure that students are able to progress efficiently through the skills certificate and more traditional educational programs, and are training college faculty and secondary school teachers to teach the introductory courses and use GIS materials in their classes.  The project also develops new internships and field experiences for students in the skills certificate and technician training programs.  <br/><br/>The Intellectual Merit of this project lies in the development of standards-based GIS curricula and certification programs available to both traditional and non-traditional students.  The Broader Impacts of this project lie in the development of seamless articulation agreements from the high school level through to university degree programs, and in training teachers at the high school and community college level to teach in this new program.<br/><br/>"

The project goal is to increase the retention and successful completion rates of community college algebra students by developing a collaborative, research-based approach to the improvement of teaching and learning mathematics. Project partners, Mesa, American River and West Valley Colleges are supported by both professional state mathematical organizations and the Center for Student Success.<br/><br/>Project objectives include adapting, pilot testing and evaluating three recommended approaches to increasing student success:<br/>1) adapting/refining a specialized mathematics study skills course developed at Manatee and Valencia Community Colleges in Florida;<br/>2) adapting/refining a teacher specific peer tutoring approach, Beacon; and<br/>3) supplementing the course with computer-aided instruction using ALEKS.<br/><br/>This project is designed to adapt, implement, investigate and determine which of these strategies are effective with specific groups of 'at risk' community college students. Project objectives also include the development of a virtual resource center, regular partner meetings and a summer institute that is facilitating contact, communication and exchange of information among mathematics faculty members. The Project Resource Center is also being used as a clearinghouse for information regarding current research, available curriculum, instructional resources, and best practices for teaching Elementary Algebra. Project-produced educational materials, evaluation instruments, pilot test results and lessons learned are being disseminated."

The Pathways project is expanding and adapting tested strategies to both Elementary and Intermediate algebra by developing a collaborative, research-based, system-wide approach to the improvement of teaching and learning basic mathematics. With support from a consortium of California community colleges, the Community College and Lumina Foundations, and the Center for Student Success, the Pathways Project is designed to leverage extensive resources from multiple partner organizations. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Project objectives center on the adaptation, pilot testing and evaluation of three recommended approaches to increasing student success in algebra: 1) providing a specialized mathematics study skills course in a learning community format; 2) the implementation of a peer tutor training program for a math study center and 3) the use of computer aided instruction. The purpose of the project is to investigate and determine which of these strategies are most effective for use with specific groups of at risk community college students. Project objectives include the development of a virtual resource center and a summer Algebra Institute that facilitates communication among mathematics faculty members. Project-produced educational materials, evaluation instruments, pilot test results and lessons learned are contained in a final project report, shared with project partners and made available to others through the new electronic resource center."
