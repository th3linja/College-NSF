Students (approximately 8 per year) work full time for 10 weeks during the summer, and have the option of continuing part-time during the academic year under the supervision of JPL scientists on various Astronomy-related projects, both at JPL and at JPL's Table Mountain Observatory. Research topics include high precision astrometry of occulting asteroids, photometry of near-Earth asteroids, design and testing of a compact Doppler magnetograph, and research into space optical communications systems.<br/><br/>CURE students are drawn exclusively from community colleges. In addition to being remarkably diverse in virtually every way, these students have often overcome great obstacles and challenges to get where they are. CURE provides them with a priceless opportunity to experience real science and real research ? an opportunity usually available only to four-year college and university students. In addition to providing underserved and minority students (many of whom are first generation college students) with valuable professional research experience, CURE's impact extends beyond the students it serves.  CURE connects community college faculty with cutting-edge research, keeping them up-to-date in the field, strengthens the relationship between community colleges and professional researchers, and provides valuable inspiration, incentive and modeling to all STEM students at the participating community colleges."

Fifty-five percent of all California State University students, and nearly one third of all University of California students, start their careers in community colleges, and yet these students may never have access to top-notch research and mentoring opportunities while at their local colleges. CURE's mission is to provide these students -- especially females, underrepresented minorities, non-traditional students -- this cutting-edge access. Students will be paired with JPL scientists to conduct research at both JPL and its Table Mountain Observatory. They will perform detailed research into a variety of topics, including space physics instrumentation, observations and analysis of asteroids, and spectroscopy of minerals likely to be found on Mars. <br/><br/>By offering high-quality research experiences and dedicated mentoring to students in partnership with one of the world's most prolific space science institutions, CURE aims to propel its participants to transfer successfully to four-year universities and advanced degree programs and careers in STEM fields. Its previous award (AST-1156756) is an exemplar of success: many students have published their research, and almost all have transferred to four-year universities. This new award will enable CURE to place a renewed focus on boosting the numbers of females and African American in the program, which will expand STEM training opportunities to these groups."
