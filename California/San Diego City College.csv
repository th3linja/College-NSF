The target population is economically and/or educationally disadvantaged students in STEM fields. The goals of the this project are to increase retention of students in STEM disciplines and to increase the number of students who: a) pursue STEM academic and career pathways b) graduate with B.S. degrees in STEM fields and c) participate in STEM industry internships/research. <br/><br/>The institutions included in this collaboration are San Diego State University, San Diego City College, and Southwestern College. The project is incorporating the Math, Engineering, Science, Achievement (MESA) Program model at each partner campus. It is enhancing efforts to provide essential services that help students excel academically, develop leadership skills, and gain exposure to industry. Team internships are being facilitated through this project to provide students with opportunities to increase their knowledge and to develop skills for academic and workplace success, and ultimately to become part of the economic development of the region. A ""Guide to an Effective STEP"" is being developed to disseminate the outcomes and effectiveness of the SPSD program to contribute to the national effort to increase student participation in STEM fields."

Because defense industry downsizing is forcing manufacturing and machine tool firms into new markets (e.g., biomed, biotech, electronics), CNC operators and CAD/CAM technologists are needed who can use advanced technology to design and produce small, complex parts. To supply graduates for these jobs, the college is developing its undergraduate Machine Technology program into an Advanced CAD/CAM & CNC Technology curriculum. The college and an industry partner are funding new CAD/CAM software delivering advanced surface modeling capability to DOS and NT platforms; this project purchases machine tool components needed to add 4th and 5th axis movement to the College's 3-axis vertical machining center (VMC). Corresponding improvement of Introductory/Advanced CAD/CAM courses let students use the CAD/CAM software to model and verify advanced CNC surface programs; in improved Introductory/Advanced CNC Vertical Machining & EDM courses, they learn to set up and operate the 5-axis VMC needed to machine their programs. In a new 200 series, Advanced VMC, students use the software and 5-axis VMC to design and execute sophisticated surface models for applied research and industry applications."
