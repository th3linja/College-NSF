Commercially obtained software programs is being used to study, record and analyze electrocardiograms, lung function, somatic reflexes, electroencephalograms, and simulated muscle physiology. Students are able to save data to disc and analyze their own readings and class data as well. They are gaining knowledge of basic physiology and also becoming more computer literate at the same time. These exercises are being incorporated into the laboratory schedule and becoming a part of the standard curriculum for the Human Physiology, General Biology and Anatomy/Physiology courses at Merritt College, a two-year community college in Oakland, California. Other colleges in the Peralta Community College District, of which Merritt College is a part, are being introduced to the software. Laboratory experiences with the computers and programs are being shared with these colleges at joint staff development meetings. Demonstration sessions are also be held for Merritt College instructors so that this equipment can be incorporated into most of the biology classes offered at Merritt College. As a result of this new technological capability in our undergraduate laboratories, our students have a better understanding of basic physiological and biological principles, as well as an increased level of computer skill and confidence."

At the same time, research on Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified buildings suggests that improved indoor environmental quality increases worker productivity. The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates that there are 292,000 ""HVAC Mechanics and Installers"" employed in the U.S. and that the field will add almost 40,000 new positions between 2014 and 2024, a much faster than average rate of growth. A study for the HVACR Workforce Development foundation estimates that 70% of openings in the field are middle skill jobs requiring postsecondary education and that the demand for these workers outstrips supply. To address these issues, it is necessary to educate a workforce of Building Automation Systems (BAS) Specialists as well as High Performance Building Operations Professionals (HPBOP). The Building Efficiency for a Sustainable Tomorrow (BEST) Center will focus on growing its national network of community and technical colleges interested in improving and/or developing new building science technician education programs. <br/><br/>The BEST Center proposes to serve as a national vehicle for the collection, dissemination, and adoption of responsive, timely, and exceptional educational programs, courses, lab applications, and innovative instructional methods for the education of building systems technicians. This project outlines three goals: 1) Transform the instructional capacity of community colleges in the field of building technician education, with an emphasis on HPBOP and BAS training and certification; 2) Engage industry stakeholders and research partners in a national collaboration with community colleges to support high quality building science instructional programs; and, 3) Strengthen the national STEM pipeline for building technicians, focusing on outreach to both high school students and underrepresented adult learners. The Center will continue to archive model curriculum and disseminate and promote adoption of this model curriculum nationwide."

This proposal responds to a national need for broad improvement in technical education as well as local industry needs for bioscience technicians who have A.S. degrees or vocational certificates. This project will develop a curriculum in biotechnology that provides students with a strong scientific background and practical skills acquisition necessary for success in the work place. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of basic scientific principles and techniques, the ability to use sophisticated scientific equipment and computers, and the ability to think critically. In addition, this project will respond to the needs of a rapidly changing work force by reducing embedded institutional barriers to women and other underrepresented groups seeking to enter science and mathematics based occupations, incorporating new instructional methods which address the diverse learning styles of students, providing cooperative learning environments which are more supportive for diverse learners, and developing an integrated curriculum which provides students with practical skills acquisition and hands-on application of knowledge. The Vista program is based upon a committed industry-education-city partnership for the design and evaluation of the curriculum and in support of student training through mentorships with industry employees and internships in the work place. The program is based upon a set of skill and knowledge requirements designed by industry scientists and the program and curriculum development process has incorporated several review sessions by an industry advisory committee culminating in general endorsement of the program."

Laney College, Berkeley Biotechnology Education, Inc., (BBEI), and 35 local health and bioscience companies have formed a dynamic partnership with two local high schools and CSU-Hayward to educate and train urban youth for entry-level positions in the biotechnology field. The project has received major contributions of time, money, and equipment from industry partners to ensure the success of students in school and in the workplace. BBEI has piloted a program in two urban high schools that targets students from backgrounds underrepresented in the laboratory sciences. These students complete two years of biotechnology education in high school and graduate with a Certificate in Biotechnology. Laney College, through its Bioscience Career Institute, enrolls these graduates in a one-year intensive science program designed to meet the bioscience industry's requirements for skilled entry-level technical positions. Students at Laney College are concurrently employed in co-op jobs at local bioscience/biotechnology companies. Linking the college curriculum to industry employment increases students' understanding of the scientific career opportunities available in the local area. The NSF ATE project builds on the existing model to increase student enrollment and modifies the curriculum making it more relevant and responsive to industry needs. The three-year project: (1) establishes a working Bioscience Process Laboratory that integrates industry personnel in training underrepresented students in relevant laboratory skills; (2) expands student enrollment in the biotechnology program to all interested students in addition to students in the current high school programs; (3) increases industry involvement by creating additional co-op jobs and new industry co-teaching roles; (4) provides additional support in recruitment and retention to increase the numbers of qualified program graduates by 50%; (5) evaluates obstacles students encounter during recruitment, education, training, retention, and after program graduation; (6) disseminates this model by means of manuals that detail the establishment of school-industry partnerships to support technical education. The NSF ATE project engages, recruits, trains, retains, and inspires students for life-long learning."
