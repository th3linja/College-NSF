LAB-Pro has been designed as a multifaceted program that is achieving its goals in three primary ways. First, it is preparing high school and community college students for technical careers in bioscience by exposing them to career opportunities in the field and giving them the skills and practical experience needed to succeed in a highly demanded career. In addition, it is enhancing the knowledge of high school science teachers and community college instructors in bioscience. Finally, it is establishing a pipeline of qualified bioscience technicians, primarily from underrepresented minority groups, to fill the numerous jobs available within the growing bioscience field in Southern California.   The eighteen month project directly impacts a minimum of 20 community college students and 24 senior high school students, and indirectly impact many more.  ***"

Almost half of undergraduate student veterans enroll in a community college after separation from service.  However, veterans are considerably under-represented in STEM.  In this project, East Los Angeles College (an HSI community college) and the University of California Los Angeles (a research university) will collaborate to offer a coordinated series of classroom performance interventions, internships, and counseling that focus on understanding and meeting veterans' needs. By evaluating effective practices to increase engagement and retention of student veterans, this project has the potential to model a way for other postsecondary institutions to meet the needs of student veterans and their transition into civilian STEM careers. <br/><br/>Project SERVES is designed to broaden participation of veterans in STEM careers.  The project will use three assessments, developed by the Center for Community College Student Engagement, to track multiple benchmarks of student engagement.  Many veterans possess unique strengths as potential college students, including commitment, strong work ethic, discipline, accountability, and teamwork. Veterans may also have undergone highly specialized technical training in a Military Occupational Specialty. However, veterans face challenges that may be compounded when they encounter traditional STEM education. Research indicates that confidence levels, curriculum overload, STEM faculty teaching styles, and inadequate advising/counseling are responsible for poor retention of STEM students, including veterans. SERVES will pilot and disseminate results of their research, which will assess the effectiveness of STEM student engagement strategies.  This program may provide a replicable model for increasing the success of community college?s in recruiting and retaining student veterans in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The awards will be available on a competitive basis to all science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors who demonstrate finanical need and the aptitude to succeed in STEM disciplines.  Data shows that attrition in STEM disciplines is disproportionately high among Hispanic students at ELAC.  Building on the infrastructure established by the institution's Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) and Academic and Student Support to Improve Student Transfer (ASSIST) programs, S-STAR will provide not only scholarships, but also supplemental instruction, access to a STEM Study Center, one-on-one counseling, mentoring, research and internship opportunities, professional development workshops, and other support services that are strategically planned to foster student success.  Being the state's largest Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), ELAC is implementing S-STAR to increase the number of academically talented, underrepresented STEM students successfully prepared for transfer to four-year STEM degree programs, and ultimately to high-skill, high-wage jobs in fields of local and national need.  Additionally, this project will contribute to diversity in research.  By increasing S-STAR students' competitiveness and encouraging them to participate in undergraduate research, these students will more likely to attend graduate school.<br/><br/>S-STAR objectives are to: (1) alleviate economic burdens of college students with demonstrated financial need, while improving students' educational opportunities; (2) increase retention, success rates and degree completion; and (3) increase the number of skilled STEM students ready to succeed in technical areas of local and national need by increasing their competitiveness to participate in research and internship experiences within four-year institutions, industry, and/or national labs, while at the community college.  Both qualitative and quantitative data collection efforts will be used to assess the attainment of the objectives.  Ongoing dissemination of incremental outcomes, best practices and lessons learned is planned through scholarly articles focused on women and minorities in science and engineering, community college STEM student success, and through presentations at conferences that offer platforms to share knowledge among both community colleges and four-year institutions."

The project improves articulation at both high school to college and two-year to four-year institution levels; implements faculty advisement and counseling, assigns students to faculty mentors who help design efficient educational plans and STEM pathways; expands research and internship opportunities at university laboratories; and exposes students to professional milieus, broadens their vision of career opportunities, and helps them to develop research skills.  In addition, a summer bridge program attracts high school juniors and seniors who have not previously considered STEM careers.  <br/><br/>Given its large Hispanic enrollment, advancing STEM education at ELAC helps to increase Latino STEM graduates and transfers. Increased rates of graduation and transfer enable more educationally disadvantaged Latinos to enter the STEM workforce. With this project, the college's infrastructure is redesigned to focus on opportunities in STEM careers, and to smooth transfer pathways to regional universities. Faculty participation in advising, mentoring and sharing of effective pedagogical methods helps transform ELAC into a STEM transfer gateway institution.  ELAC disseminates information about the project to similar types of institution, shares best practices, and encourages them to adopt procedures to increase STEM transfers and graduates."

Recent technological advances in such areas as Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) have provided surveyors with new tools for doing this work. In addition, environmental measuring and monitoring is increasingly critical as the population grows, land values appreciate, natural resources decrease, and stresses degrade the quality of our land, water, and air. Surveying and mapping technicians, or geospatial engineering technicians, are a critical part of the geomatics workforce that will provide these critical measurements.  This project focuses on developing robust career pathways and academic programs to educate land surveying and/or geospatial engineering technicians.<br/><br/>This project will: 1) develop an academic transfer pathway program to provide a career and technical education (CTE) that enables secondary school and community college students to properly use advanced forms of field equipment and software for land surveying and/or geospatial engineering applications; and 2) assist land surveying and/or geospatial engineering technicians to successfully pass the State of California examinations. High school boot camps and a ""land surveying-CAD bash"" event at four primarily Hispanic secondary schools will recruit students into the program.  In addition, a career opportunity internship pipeline will be formalized with the City of Los Angeles, Bureau of Engineering, Surveying Division's volunteer program. This career opportunity internship pipeline is expected to increase the numbers of female and Hispanic surveying and/or geospatial engineering technicians entering the work force.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
