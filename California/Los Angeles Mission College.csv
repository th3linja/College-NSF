Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims. This project at Los Angeles Mission College will advance the aims of the HSI Program by developing a student-centered intervention to support the success of undergraduate biology students. The project aims to increase the success of biology majors in their courses at Los Angeles Mission College and in transfer to four-year universities. This project plans to achieve these aims through weekly academic success workshops that help biology majors pass college algebra and trigonometry courses. This intervention is expected to stimulate student engagement in biology through mathematics, which will increase student success and retention in gateway mathematics courses and persistence in the major. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are to increase the persistence, success, retention rates, and transfer rates of biology majors, with a focus on those in college algebra and trigonometry courses. By making the quantitative aspects of biology more engaging and relevant via academic success workshops, the project aims to increase student success and retention rates in college algebra and trigonometry. The academic success workshops will facilitate student peer learning that are designed to increase a sense of community among students. Faculty from Los Angeles Mission College and the University of California, Los Angeles, will develop the supplemental materials and refine them via feedback provided through implementation of academic success workshops at Los Angeles Mission College. This project will also hold workshops for faculty from other institutions seeking to enhance the quantitative experience of their biology majors. The project will investigate the impact of supplemental materials used in academic success workshops on student success in college algebra and trigonometry, persistence to calculus, and successful transfer to four-year universities. The project will analyze performance of students who attended the academic success workshops to students who did not. The project will develop a model that targets a diverse student population in the biological sciences that may increase success, retention, and degree completion rates via contextualized mathematics in the biological sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The new programs developed will explicitly address skill development and offer students counseling, tutoring, industry field trips, external speakers, and internship opportunities. Combined with excellent instruction in the classroom, these activities will prepare students for entry-level, middle-skill technician positions. LAMC serves a large underrepresented student body and will provide these students with employment opportunities in a high growth sector that needs a skilled workforce. Project evaluation will focus on measuring student progression, success, retention, and degree attainment.<br/><br/>LAMC will develop new academic pathways and curricula in biotechnology leading to stackable certificates and an Associate of Science degree. Stackable credentials will prepare students to enter the workforce in a short period of time while retaining the opportunity to pursue higher degrees at a later date. It will also allow for flexibility that will contribute to student retention and success. The project will provide high school students an opportunity to earn college credit and credentials that will ultimately assist them in obtaining employment."
