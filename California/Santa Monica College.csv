Santa Monica College and its industry partners are further developing and improving an existing Solar Photovoltaic Installation program created in response to industry need. Through a multifaceted project that includes program improvement as well as curriculum and educational materials development, this project is creating and implementing strategies to bridge the gap between employer demand for qualified workers and student ability to acquire the skills necessary to match employment opportunities in the field, including on the job training and math and science understanding.  This project focuses on three inter-related strategies for addressing workforce demand, including 1) expanded outreach to include K-12 and community based training programs; 2) the development of contextualized math and science modules to strengthen the solar photovoltaic curriculum and improve student success; and 3) the development of an internship course to provide on the job training for students while connecting them with potential employers. Through these activities, the college is improving the regional capacity to address the workforce demands of the solar industry. The project aims to increase student enrollment in the program by targeting high school students and first time freshmen, women, veterans, and underrepresented minorities so the program enrollment more closely resembles the general student population. It plans to improve student completion rates in courses by improving their math and science skills and increase student aptitude to attain employment by engaging students in internship opportunities.<br/><br/>As a minority serving institution located in a highly diverse region, this project is impacting a diverse array of students, including many low-income, ethnically diverse, first generation college students, and providing them the opportunity to pursue viable careers in a new and emerging field. Employers are being provided a steady stream of skilled applicants for job openings that have both the hands on training and a strong background in math and science necessary to address immediate employer needs and advance in their careers. The educational materials developed to support the degree program are being thoroughly assessed for effectiveness and disseminated throughout California and the nation to assist other regions as they prepare a qualified workforce for the solar energy industry. An extensive evaluation is also assessing the effectiveness of the new strategies designed to increase the number of students who enter the Solar Industry workforce.<br/><br/>Advanced technological education in solar energy is part of a career path that begins in middle school and high school, continues through community college, and provides opportunities beyond the community college setting. This project, both its needs and its responses, is based on extensive conversations with students, faculty, and industry advisors both locally and throughout the state regarding the barriers to success both in the classroom and in the workplace. Strategies, specifically the development of contextualized math and science education and field-based learning experiences, are research-based and have demonstrated success in other industries. With these program improvements, students who pursue coursework through the Solar Photovoltaic Installation Program are completing their studies with the skills and knowledge that they need to enter the workforce or continue their education."

Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims. With HSI program support, this Track 1 project at Santa Monica College (SMC) aims to identify, implement and investigate interventions that enhance the success and subsequent graduation of Hispanic and other underrepresented STEM students through the use of culturally responsive and effective classroom-based curricular materials and instructional practices focused on STEM. SMC will bring together the equity-focused work of the college's Science and Research Initiative and the Center for Teaching Excellence to implement a three-pronged approach that includes faculty professional development, pilot and assessment of research-based innovations, and dissemination of project outcomes both internally and externally. This project will target first year and other tenure track STEM faculty and provide them with release time so that they may participate in a 2-year professional development program and allocate the time necessary to develop and implement effective equity-minded interventions in their courses. By assessing the impact of both the innovations and the professional development, SMC will establish a toolbox of effective practices that can be used by STEM and non-STEM faculty, as well as a professional development strategy that can be sustained beyond the grant period for ongoing delivery to new faculty. <br/><br/>The project will build upon research-based effective practice currently underway at SMC's Science and Research Initiative, as well as research from the field, to explore and further assess innovative approaches to community college student success in STEM. The project will identify effective strategies for engaging the faculty in change-focused activities designed to improve student success through critical transitions, thereby helping the numerous colleges across the country that are struggling to bridge the cultural divide between STEM faculty and a culturally diverse student population.  The project will assess not only the impact of the proposed innovations on student ability to successfully transition, but also the degree to which the professional development contributes to teaching effectiveness, student sense of belonging and learning, and departmental and institutional culture. Project evaluation will assess the quality of the program and its ability to achieve grant goals and long-term project outcomes, as well as provide ongoing feedback to suggest improvements in implementation. The research focus of this project is to identify effective pedagogical strategies and methods of teaching that positively impact student success and successful transitions. The research will use a quasi-experimental design to assess each intervention, using a combination of both qualitative and quantitative indicators to answer both implementation and outcome evaluation questions. Project summative evaluation and research includes conducting a pre- and post- assessment of all students impacted by the project at both the beginning and end of each academic year, immediately after they graduate, and again one year after program completion. Project data will be disaggregated by race/ethnicity, income status, and gender. Project results will be disseminated at regional and national conferences. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these students are the first in their family to attend college and represent demographic groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines.  These interventions will bridge the academic curriculum with comprehensive student support services and will include STEM-focused counseling and career planning sessions, a STEM speaker series, STEM skill building workshops, and applied learning activities, including research opportunities with local university and industry partners.  This project will provide additional support in math, which is often the primary barrier to success in STEM for community college students, many of whom enter underprepared in math.<br/>  <br/>The STEM Scholars program evaluation plan includes both formative and summative components that will assess the effectiveness of the project in improving student outcomes, as well as measuring the institution's capacity to support student success.  In collaboration with SMC's Office of Institutional Research, the formative component will assess the establishment of a program database to evaluate applications, development of marketing materials, initiation of classroom presentations, distribution of scholarship funding, and facilitation of cohort activities.  The summative component will assess the overall impact of this project on both students and the institution and will focus on the project's four primary objectives and how the project has helped achieve the S-STEM Program Goals."
