The curriculum is being designed as a certificate program and can be later modified to become an associate degree program. It is providing model course contents, examples, assignments, lab activities and fieldwork.<br/>The impact of this project includes the dissemination and adoption of the curriculum by any community college or high school in the nation. To facilitate the information dissemination, workshops are being organized to train teachers who want to use this curriculum and the contents of the curriculum are being published through both printed media and electronic media including booklets, website and CDs and through conference presentations. The curriculum is being first evaluated by a panel of experts from the industry, universities, ASCE and ACSM, and then implemented at Evergreen Valley College and Santa Rosa Junior College and eventually disseminated through the country. The project is a collaborative effort among industry, education institutions and government agencies. The project has so far secured support from Trimble (the main GPS vendor), ESRI (the largest maker of GIS software), Bentley (the main civil engineering CAD vendor), Autodesk (the main CAD vendor), Santa Clara Valley Water District, HMH Engineering, Caltran, Santa Clara County, regional high schools, Santa Rosa Junior College, California State University at Fresno and San Jose Sate University."

The U.S. Labor Department's Occupational Outlook projects that the job market for surveying and mapping technicians will increase 9 to 17 percent from 2004 to 2014. With very few universities offering land surveying programs, the training of land surveying technicians occurs predominantly at community colleges. A review of the land surveying programs offered by two-year colleges, however, reveals significant gaps between the needs of the industry and training offered by the two-year institutions. <br/><br/>Over the last few years, a new technology, 3-D laser scanning, has emerged as a very important tool in land surveying. This project incorporates this new technology into land surveying curricula by developing, testing and delivering new courses materials, including model course content, examples, assignments, laboratory activities, and field work. The course materials developed in this project can be adopted by any community college or high school in the nation. To facilitate information dissemination, workshops are training teachers who want to use this curriculum, and the contents of the curriculum are being published through both printed media and electronic media, including booklets, a website, CDs, and conference presentations. The curriculum is first being evaluated by a panel of experts from the industry, universities, the American Society of Civil Engineers, and the American Congress on Surveying and Mapping, and then implemented at Evergreen Valley College and Santa Rosa Junior College and eventually disseminated nationally. The project is a collaborative effort among industry, educational institutions, and government agencies. The project has secured support from Trimble, Santa Clara Valley Water District, HMH Engineering, Silicon Valley Land Surveying, Caltran, Santa Clara County, regional high schools, Santa Rosa Junior College, California State University at Fresno, and San Jose Sate University.<br/>"

This program serves as a school-to-work model for community colleges, meets the needs of students seeking entry level jobs and IT professionals seeking to upgrade their technical skills, and provides the necessary foundation for students who decide to transfer to four year institutions. In particular, the project develops and validates certification standards for entry level positions in high-performance companies. IT representatives are selected from industry, academia and the public sector to identify the needed skill sets, soft skills are incorporated into the curriculum, internship experiences are made available to students, and certification of skill acquisition are to be based upon industry standards. The new curriculum is delivered via technology mediated learning (interactive CD and the Internet). The target audiences for this project include students in high schools, community colleges and universities, particularly Latino students. It also includes IT workers retraining for jobs in emerging high-tech fields and faculty at high schools and community colleges. This project is a collaborative that includes Evergreen Valley College, East Side Union High School District, Foothill/DeAnza Community College District, San Jose State University, Workforce Silicon Valley, Sun Microsystems, Oracle Corporation, CBT Systems, and Waite Group Press."

We concur this is a highly meritorious proposal that will serve Hispanic students. This project will provide accelearted mathematics instruction to approximately 35 Hispanic students per year through an instructional/counseling/mentoring model. The program's goal is to select Hispanic students who show promise and strong interest in mathematics, but lack prerequisite skills in mathematics and prepare them for calculus and courses in the physical and engineering sciences. Students will also be assigned to a Hispanic mentor who is a professional engineer scientist or mathematician, and whose professional area is related to the career interests of the student. There are some minor concerns that should be addressed, e.g. Who will be the consultants? What will be the rate of compensation for the tutors? What are the plans for follow up, i.e. post award?"
