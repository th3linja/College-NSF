The first half of the project links the GIS Certification program at Foothill College with the bachelor's and master's level GIS program at San Jose State University by creating a two course curricular sequence to train students to build and maintain a common web-GIS, or internet mapping server (IMS). This IMS serves as the foundation for the second half of the project, which ties in to National Standards in both Science and Geography, and trains both pre-and in-service teachers in the use of IMS-driven course material in the classroom. This project develops an interdisciplinary program that reaches across the fields of science (biological and physical) and social science. In addition, the creation of a web-based GIS/IMS built and maintained by students for students is an original concept developed by this team that advances interdisciplinary cooperation and knowledge and makes this technology accessible to a broad cross-section of underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>This project 1) increases the accessibility of infrastructure for research and education to all levels of public school funding settings, and 2) develops an undergraduate level model curriculum for IMS coursework (to augment an existing GIS certificate program) which articulates between community college and four year schools. Underrepresented groups and school districts without the means to purchase expensive equipment and software are able to participate in this project as well as continue beyond the end date. In this manner the project provides a social benefit that reaches beyond the classroom and provides high school students entering the job market with technical and analytical experience that has been out of reach in the past. The two course IMS curriculum and supporting high school curriculum are being disseminated via the project website. The community college level IMS curriculum serves as a model to the many community college GIS certificate programs currently in place. The IMS curriculum helps to meet the current workforce demand of employers for graduates of community college GIS training programs who have the technical skills to build and maintain a web GIS. Students from both the Foothill/DeAnza Community College District and San Jose State University GIS program are eligible to take the IMS courses developed in the first half of this project. <br/><br/>For additional workforce development and real-world problem solving, the students also participate in internships at NASA Ames Research Center and other federal, state and local agencies. The second half of the project utilizes the GIS data on the IMS built and maintained by students in the Foothill/San Jose State Program for the development of high school social science and earth science based curriculum that is tied to state and national educational standards. The web-based curriculum is centered around an important regional issue, the South Bay Wetlands Restoration Project, but could be adapted to other local issues such as land use modification associated with changing population pressures, urban redevelopment, non-point source pollution, and fire assessment, and other social and scientific concerns."

It is anticipated that 150 college faculty and 11 graduate students will benefit directly from this project in terms of enhancing their teaching approaches, with many more undergraduate students benefitting from the resultant improved courses.  The structure and content of the program is patterned after the Scientific Teaching Institutes organized by Jo Handelsman at the University of Wisconsin and has as its objective to enhance faculty pedagogical expertise, provide faculty with support to iteratively change their teaching and develop professional learning communities of community college faculty in the San Francisco Bay area.  <br/><br/>The three aspects of this project are: 1. The Scientific Teaching Workshops Series an introductory series of five three hour workshops for those faculty with limited time who want to learn what is available in the hopes of participating in a more intense experience later on (offered during the spring term on a rotating basis at each of ten community colleges within the San Francisco Bay area); 2. The Scientific Teaching Summer Institute, a week long full day activity taking place on the campus of San Francisco State and 3. Follow up activities to help faculty implement what they have learned and to develop a teaching community among participants and their colleagues.  The project further benefits from an additional resource, SEPAL (Science Education Partnership and Assessment Laboratory) developed by Kimberly Tanner, a graduate student training program at SFSU that includes working with faculty to develop faculty teaching strengths. <br/><br/>Materials being used at the workshops include: the Scientific Teaching workbook developed by Jo Handelsman for the long standing Scientific Teaching Institutes workshops at the University of Wisconsin Madison, designed for faculty at research intensive universities and those teaching large introductory courses; the Approaches to Biology Teaching and Learning a publication collection written by Kimberly Tanner to translate key findings from the educational literature into practical teaching strategies for the college classroom; and curricular materials developed for SEPAL. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The merit of this project resides in its use of successful activities and materials developed for one audience to transform opportunities available for a different audience.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:  Given the large number of students taught by the faculty involved and the fact that in the bay area many biology majors at four year schools start their academic careers at community colleges, this project's potential to effect many students is obvious."

In this expanded second stage of the project, a second Advanced Summer Institute is available to graduates of the first who are interested in collaborating to develop a common assessment tool.  This tool applied to the population of San Francisco area community college students generates powerful data measuring the effectiveness of scientific teaching on student learning.  Additional activities of the emerging learning community include Teaching Squares, groups of four faculty at one or several institutions who meet together regularly to share teaching strategies and observe each others' classes; and Classroom Partnerships between a mentor community college faculty  member and a SFSU graduate student interested in pursuing college-level teaching as a career.  The enthusiastic response to the first phase of this project demanded that it be extended and amplified.  To do so in the direction of establishing data on effectiveness makes the experience all the richer.  This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts toward Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education."

STEMWay combines four key elements, consistent with recent research on STEM student success: academic support services that closely parallel STEM courses and pathways; analytical management to enable comprehensive support with limited resources; comprehensive mentoring services for progressive student success within an active learning community; and continual involvement by all STEM faculty members for collaborative improvement. STEMWay academic student support applies a scaffolding model, which includes multi-dimensional skills readiness assessment to improve placement of students into appropriate courses and to identify knowledge gaps, and anticipatory booster instruction to give students the necessary skills for success in each course.  A full-service emporium supplies assessments and instruction, coordinates with faculty and courses, monitors students' pathway progress, and assesses success of each program element.  STEMWay's initial target is 482 additional student graduations (a 95% increase beyond baseline) in a 2-year mathematics progression, which has been shown to be foundational for success in all STEM areas.  <br/><br/>STEMWay evaluation includes formative analysis of multiple program factors for continual feedback, to be followed by summative evaluation of STEMWay as a full system to promote STEM retention, and dissemination of STEMWay assessment of effective strategies to positively impact nation-wide STEM graduation efforts.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:  STEMWay is a testable model of ""intensive intervention"", reflecting a theory of student retention that has been proposed but not yet fully implemented, according to its theorists Tinto and Seidman.  STEMWay combines early and continuous assessment and intervention with strategic management optimization practices, and with academic community construction.  STEMWay methods produce improved pedagogical models and strategies for STEM success.  The experiences of the full program and of each of its parts inform colleges of effective practices for STEM student progression, retention, and graduation. STEMWay defines and applies a system of wrap-around services for students' academic needs outside the classroom.  STEMWay adapts multiple external and internal resources for assessment, placement, and scaffolding.  The combination of a comprehensive solution for complementary academic support with longitudinal implementation and improvement, and applied management science to add adaptive allocation of resources, is new.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The STEMWay project is expected to increase the number of graduates with associate degrees and to prepare more students for advanced 4-year studies leading into STEM careers.  As many Foothill College graduates continue on to receive baccalaureate degrees at local universities or are employed in Silicon Valley, increasing the number of STEM graduates immediately benefits the local community and further benefits the nation. Because Foothill College currently supports teacher preparation and STEM teacher recruitment, its efforts lead to more K-12 STEM teachers, especially among underrepresented groups.  A successful STEMWay program changes not only the lives of participating students for the better but also those who benefit from the successes of STEM companies and corporations who hire qualified STEM graduates."

Action research is used to engage faculty, under the guidance of professional researchers, in examining the challenges of implementing SBL instruction in technician education.  An online community of practice is developed by establishing a library of SBL resources and by linking to ATE centers and projects, initially in biology and bio-informatics.  Three prototype online wizards are developed and tested to support community college instructors in editing existing SBL activities, in creating new SBL activities and in creating principled assessments items using the ideas of evidence-centered design.  An advisory board of industry representatives and educational researchers in the fields of teaming, problem based learning and collaborative learning guide the development and validation of the scenarios.  The evaluation determines metrics to measure the extent to which the SBLs prove useful to faculty and students in technical education."

Community college students and returning learners are educated through a sequence of carefully devised tasks and problems that simulate an authentic work experience. The story provides a coherent framework that has students working on both long-term objectives and day-to-day operations.  The model is learning by doing with goal-based scenarios.  In response to the high interest by employers, network security is the subject of the pilot program.  The role of the faculty changes to deciding on and facilitating scenarios and providing just in time tutorials rather than providing information that is readily available elsewhere.  Faculty and mentor development are supported.  SRI provides the formative and summative evaluation.  The pilot tested model can be expanded to include more of the information technology curriculum and can be applied to other curricula."

The focus of the project is to enable scholarship students to attend full-time and to complete their STEM programs reliably in two years. The students are being supported by the STEM Emporium at the college, a program designed to increase completions in STEM majors by supplying out-of-classroom academic support. The student scholars are also supported by many established student support groups that supply experienced and focused support for student sub-populations. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project is providing scholarship recipients full opportunities and resources to stay in a STEM major, to focus on courses and not be distracted by working and financially supporting themselves, to attend full-time, and to engage with faculty and cohort students. The scholars are benefiting from an array of support services that includes faculty mentors, dedicated counselors, academic tutoring, and services to aid students who are transferring to universities or who wish to obtain career-track internships or research opportunities. A diverse group of faculty members, who are knowledgeable about population subgroups and serve as role models, are mentoring the students. The scholarships are increasing the academic success of students, rates of completion, transfer to universities, and career readiness. In addition, the program is offering students optional research opportunities that are traditionally available only to students at four-year universities by partnering with universities that provide access to advanced laboratories, instrumentation, and personnel. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project is improving the retention of academically talented, financially disadvantaged students, many of whom are from groups underrepresented in STEM professions, thus increasing the economic and racial diversity in STEM graduates and transfer students, and narrowing socioeconomic gaps. Students are learning job skills and gaining confidence for employment through enrichment activities such as faculty mentoring and optional internships. By recruiting and drawing students from local high schools and partnering with private sector companies, the project is giving at-risk students a financially rewarding pathway in STEM careers to which they otherwise might not have been exposed or motivated to pursue."
