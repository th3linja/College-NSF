PCC is the largest institution of higher education in Oregon. Over its five-year duration, this project will fund one-year scholarships to 108 students who are pursuing associate degrees in the biological, physical or mathematical sciences, with the expectation that 36 students (3 cohorts of 12 students) will receive these scholarships for two years, with 36 one-year scholarships awarded to these scholars transferring to Portland State University (PSU). The project will implement evidence-based project activities from recruitment to degree completion and transfer, such as targeted recruitment from local high schools, a comprehensive mentoring program from high school to PSU, enhanced faculty-student interactions, academic excellence workshops, and use of peer tutors. In addition, the project team will embed hands-on activities in PCC's mathematics curriculum related to culturally responsive teaching/learning that lower barriers to participation for women and other underrepresented students in STEM fields. The project will investigate the effectiveness of recruitment and retention strategies and other evidence-based approaches in broadening participation of underrepresented students by designing activities for a diverse pool of scholars. Furthermore, it will create a bridge between high school, PCC, and PSU, thus providing students with consistent exposure to STEM academic fields and careers and a built-in cohort for peer networking and support.<br/><br/>The aim of this project is to increase success of students pursuing STEM degrees by implementing evidence-based strategies, such as 1) collaborating with local high schools to provide additional support and encouragement of participants in entering post-secondary education, and 2) embedding peer mentors in introductory PCC math courses to begin cohort-building activities that continue throughout the scholarship program as most community colleges are not residential, thus effecting students' ability to persist in STEM. The project will make curricular changes to two introductory math courses taken by students majoring in STEM, and will investigate the degree to which these changes impact retention, with an expectation that there will be an overall increase in the percentage of students passing the course. It is anticipated that 85% of scholars will be retained from their first to their second year due to the curricular changes and intensive supports provided to them. The project will be assessed using qualitative methods such as surveys, guided interviews, and focus groups with scholars and faculty; and quantitative measures such as pass rates of targeted math courses and scholar retention and transfer rates. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will partner with a community group, the Wind & Oar Boat School, to develop activities that are culturally relevant, self-directed, and put students at the center of cooperative group-based learning. The College and community partners will work together to design, implement, and test a 36-hour inquiry-based co-curricular course in a college makerspace. The course will align basic mathematics principles that are taught in a developmental mathematics course with specific activities related to building a wooden boat. Nationwide, 60% of community college students require developmental mathematics, suggesting that many are not prepared for the college-level mathematics required for STEM degree programs. Furthermore, only one-third of students in developmental mathematics courses move on to college-level courses within six years and many end up dropping out of college completely. Project activities are expected to engage all students, including students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM.  It is also expected that the activities will increase student success in math and retention in college.  This project is designed to generate new knowledge about how makerspaces can increase equitable access to STEM education.  It will also explore whether engaging students in these spaces improves their STEM identity and self-efficacy. The project design is intended to build competencies such as critical thinking, the view that failure is a natural step toward success, and the understanding that academic ability can be improved.  It is expected that this approach can be adopted by other two-year colleges and other makerspaces that intend to expand access to all students.<br/><br/>The project will develop new interventions and approaches that transform learning for diverse student groups, particularly those in developmental mathematics courses. Eight 36-hour makerspace co-curricular activities will be developed and implemented in conjunction with Introductory Algebra II. Four of the eight activities will span two years.  The project team will adapt the Dimensions of Success Observation Tool to measure overall student success and examine whether the project activities ameliorate specific barriers for underrepresented students working in makerspace environments. Three research questions will be examined: 1) To what extent do activities that align fundamental mathematics principles with makerspace competencies increase student learning in mathematics? 2) To what extent do project activities increase student learning? 3) Does the use of makerspaces attract other mathematics educators to reform their teaching practice? A mixed-methods research design will assess the effectiveness of the project in achieving its goals and identify unexpected outcomes. Student-level data to be collected includes demographics, course success metrics, instances of future STEM course enrollments, and surveys regarding students' experiences with the intervention, perceptions of STEM identity, and self-reported identities regarding URM definitions. Surveys will be distributed to both the intervention participants and a control group. External evaluators will observe students during the activities to understand their engagement with activities and will do exit interviews to capture students' reflection on the overall experience. This project is supported by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources, which supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, despite the importance of plasma-aided manufacturing, few community colleges currently offer courses and prepare technicians in this critical technology. To address this urgent need, the project is developing essential resources that will enable community colleges to implement plasma-aided manufacturing courses. These resources include outcomes- based instructional materials, training systems in plasma technology, and workshops for community college faculty. Outcomes-based instructional materials are organized around three fundamental components of a plasma processing system. These fundamental components include plasma physics, RF power subsystems, and gas delivery subsystems. Modules on plasma applications, e.g. plasma etch, chemical vapor deposition, and sputtering, integrate the three fundamental components into a capstone-type learning experience for students. Laboratory improvement will focus on the design of plasma training systems at RF frequencies. Project staff are working with equipment suppliers to adapt current manufacturing systems for community college laboratories. Finally, faculty enhancement workshops provide hands-on opportunities with plasma training systems and disseminate instructional materials developed through this project."

A STEM Camp and two STEM workshops each year will be offered and will be open to high school seniors, with marketing and recruitment focusing on minorities and women. A cohort-building structure will be put into place where scholars will be scheduled within the same classes where possible.  One-on-one intrusive academic advising will be required for scholars, as will small-group and individual tutoring for those who need additional assistance. NSF-funded initiatives that include the Institute for Women in Trades, Technology, and Science (IWITTS) and ENGAGE Engineering will be adapted to assist in recruiting and retaining females and underrepresented minorities into the three targeted programs. Faculty members will receive training for incorporating these strategies into activities and curriculum. Everyday Examples in Engineering, Spatial Visualization Skills, and concept-based formulas, graphs, and other representations will be incorporated into classes that prepare students to solve mathematics problems in gateway engineering courses."

This unique, advanced-level technical program prepares technicians for jobs in the wafer fab in our nation's expanding semiconductor industry. Wafer fab technicians need a working knowledge of high vacuum systems because high vacuum techniques are so pervasive in the manufacture of integrated circuits. Unfortunately, few colleges are prepared to offer high vacuum systems courses because of a lack of suitable training systems and a lack of appropriate instructional materials. To address this need, this project is purchasing six miniturbomolecular (high vacuum) pumping stations and three helium leak detectors to equip a technician-level, high vacuum systems laboratory, adapt them for educational use, and design laboratory experiments for these systems. Experiments can be compiled and published as a laboratory manual for use at other community colleges and technical institutes. Laboratory experiments include demonstrations of vacuum fundamentals, operation of the pumping station, gauging and pressure measurement techniques, and leak detection."
