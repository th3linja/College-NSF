Because this project builds upon and expands prior successful S-STEM efforts (Tech Scholars Program, TSP-I and TSP-II), participants will be referred to as TSP-III Scholars.  Chemistry, physics, geology, engineering, math, computer science, and biology will be the target majors for the scholarships. Students will engage in research and/or design project experiences as part of one of several possible Research and Design Cohorts (RDCs). This will be accomplished through a one-credit course called ""Destination Graduation,"" which is an institutional requirement; a STEM-centered version of this course will be available to S-STEM scholars.  Further, students will have the opportunity to engage in additional optional RDC activities with faculty members after completion of this course.  Scholars will be recruited primarily through targeted outreach to four groups: (1) Oregon Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) program, (2) Linn and Benton Counties' 5th Year High School Students, (3) College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP), and (4) For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST) Robotics.  Targeting these groups for recruitment is expected to yield a pool of applicants who not only have the academic talent or potential to succeed in STEM disciplines, but also financial need, as many students engaged in some of the programs are low-income, first generation college students.  Additionally, the MATE ROV teams in Oregon are roughly 50% female, thus lending to the possibility of broadening participation of women in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Expected short-term outcomes of the project are: (1) to provide significant financial relief for the students; (2) to foster an environment where students feel supported by the program and the college to stay in school, have a sense of community at the college, achieve academic success, and transition successfully to a four year program; (3) to engage faculty in a system that assesses outcomes and makes changes when appropriate to improve student learning and retention.  The Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) will be used to determine whether or not the students who receive the scholarships indeed face reduced financial strain compared to non S-STEM students, including non-STEM majors.  This survey will be issued several times throughout each year allowing for a comprehensive measure of how the scholarships impact financial stability and ability to concentrate on learning.  Intermediate expected outcomes are that TSP-III scholars will: (1) be retained and perform well academically compared to their non S-STEM counterparts; and (2) transfer successfully to a four-year institution and feel a continued sense of peer group support at those institutions.  Data reflecting student retention and success will be provided by LBCC's Office of Institutional Research to track student performance each quarter allowing faculty, advisors, and project staff to intervene early if problems are identified.  The National Student Clearinghouse will be used to track the number and percent of TSP-III Scholars who transfer successfully. In collaboration with partners such as California State University at Fullerton and Oregon State University, a follow-up survey will be administered to obtain feedback on the scholars' experience, progress, and preparedness for the four-year program as well as the extent of peer support received."

This  project proposes to initiate the first phase in research designed  to develop the most appropriate interface strategies needed to  optimize ASTER and related audio-formatting programs for students  with learning disabilities.  ASTER is an innovative computer  program developed initially to present math equations in an audio  format for students with visual disabilities.  It is important  that students with learning disabilities participate in tests on  ASTER navigation during the developmental phase of this software  program.  Commands which might be intuitive to a student who is  blind might not be as easy for a sighted student with a learning  disability.  Student  volunteers from the pre-algebra course and  Adult Basic Education program at Linn Benton Community College  Benton Center will be test subjects in specific experiments  conducted to answer the following questions:  (1) What are the  most intuitive keystrokes to select sections to be read on the  computer, to browse from section to section, paragraph to  paragraph, etc.?  (2) What kind of computer screen display do  students find most helpful?  (3) What additional educational  features are useful?  This research project is conducted  collaboratively with the Science Accessibility Program at Oregon  State University which is improving ASTER as an aid to better  accessibility to math and science written material for students  with various disabilities.  Results from this project will be  used  in future designs of ASTER.  ***"

Two-year colleges (2YC) are the main entry point for individuals from underrepresented groups into the geoscience career pipeline.  However, many of these students drop out of Geoscience degree programs as they transfer to 4-year universities (4YU) because they face several challenges early in their transition. The goal of this project is to plug the leaky geoscience career pipeline through an extracurricular ?bridge? program between Linn-Benton Community College (LBCC) and Oregon State University (OSU).  We call it LBOS-GeoBridge. The very nature of this project addresses broader impacts of increasing diversity in STEM and the Geosciences in particular. Specific long-term broader impacts of this project are a stronger pipeline from 2YC to 4YU in geology/earth science in Oregon, more students from 2YC entering the geoscience workforce, and an improved model for improving success of community college students in geoscience.<br/><br/>Each year, six LBCC geology students (18 students during the 3-year period of the program) will enter this program to prepare them to navigate the academic, social, and institutional barriers transfer students to Oregon State University (OSU) face. During the Spring and Summer terms prior to transfer, students will participate in program activities designed to address transfer shock and build their cognate science knowledge and skills to lay the scaffolding for success in upper-level coursework. Using an existing network developed through earlier efforts, LBOS-GeoBridge will involve the student with a cohort and support system that is based on a mentored research project. Recruitment for this project will not be GPA-based but will focus on at risk transfers who meet the entrance requirements for OSU, many of whom are underrepresented.  Our prior efforts suggest that with opportunity and access, these students can perform as well as their more privileged peers, and part of our research will be to assess if intervention at this critical juncture leads to future success in upper-level geoscience coursework, degree completion, and employment in the geoscience workforce."

This investigation of technician workforce training needs in the Willamette Valley includes secondary and post-secondary educational institutions, business and industry, and government agencies. The project is conducting a DACUM process with employers designed to identify specific skill sets critical to industry's training needs. These skill sets are being used to assist in the design of curricula for customized training, certificates, two-year degrees, and transfer programs. The DACUM process allows the colleges to become more responsive to the education needs of the biotech industry employers. Components of the planning process can assist in the identification of potential challenges or barriers and in the development of strategies for managing these issues for secondary and postsecondary educational partners. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Assessing the region's needs is an essential component in effectively and efficiently developing coordinated, cross-industry career pathways from secondary schools to two-year colleges and from two-year colleges to both the workforce and four-year institutions. The college is sited within a relatively easy commuting distance of the major population centers of Portland, Salem, Eugene, and Corvallis. In addition, the college can directly provide educational and training access to small urban and rural communities throughout much of rural western Oregon. Through its partnership with the Oregon Bioscience Association, major investments in science and technology, recent grants supporting biofuel production, and the integration of numerical modeling throughout engineering curricula and supporting programs, the college has established itself as a statewide leader in workforce development within the technology sector. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The Central Willamette Valley, long known as an agricultural center for the state and region, has experienced recent growth within the biotechnology industry. Access to cellulosic materials makes the region an attractive location for biofuel research and production. Direct proximity to major shipping and transportation routes has attracted biopharmaceutical, biomanufacturing and food processing companies to the area. The two major questions now facing the region are regarding critical mass: 1) Does the existing biotechnology industry within the Willamette Valley have sufficient training and workforce needs to support the creation of dedicated educational and training programs? and 2) How much additional investment in local education would provide a sufficiently skilled workforce to encourage additional biotech companies to relocate to the region? This ATE center planning project can provide answers to these core planning questions for the Willamette Valley and statewide biotechnology forces in Oregon. Results are being shared broadly with industry, workforce investment boards, educational institutions, and government agencies."
