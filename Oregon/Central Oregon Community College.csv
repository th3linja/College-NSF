This growth compounds when considered globally, with the forecast for the worldwide number of HEV/EVs on the in road in 2015 at 80.4 million. The west coast (Oregon, Washington and California) is the leader in HEV/EV ownership and development with nearly one-third (32.9%) of all HEV/EVs sales nationwide in these three states alone. This project at Central Oregon Community College (COCC) will prepare technicians to work in advanced HEV and EV diagnostics, maintenance, and repair. The establishment of a regional consortium, the Advanced Vehicle Training Group Northwest, will foster technology education opportunities for instructors and advanced automotive technicians across the northwest region. This collaboration will set and implement the standard for HEV/EV education. It will bring HEV/EV educational opportunities to rural students in Central Oregon, an area with a significant Latino and Native American population. <br/><br/>This project will support student learning in science and engineering technician education by developing new curriculum aligned with Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) standards for HEV/EV certified training programs. This will add to the pedagogical knowledge in HEV/EV diagnostics, maintenance, and repair. In preparation for this effort, the college has conducted extensive research on automotive technology education gaps, has engaged in discussion with local and regional employers, has surveyed students and employers, and has investigated how other colleges statewide and nationally are addressing the HEV/EV education gap.  This project will build on previously successful models for constructing alternative curricular pathways (often described as a latticed curriculum) to provide a rich tapestry of education and training opportunities for students at various stages of the employment cycle. It will also develop novel tools needed for alternative certification of skills through ""open badges."" This national initiative is still early in development and every implementation of the badging process in a community college will add to the collective knowledge and understanding of best practices in the use of open badges to build a new curricular framework for educators in academic and industrial communities. A comprehensive evaluation plan will measures student success by completion rates for certifications, degrees, and badges earned. Outreach activities to underserved populations will focus on strategies known to be effective in reaching such students."

This equipment enables restructuring of the lab component of several science courses to include field experiments and projects using modern oceanographic equipment and techniques. This proposal is based upon research conducted at the Keck Geology Consortium (Manduca, 1996) whereby structuring hands-on and small group field research activities using modern field equipment for real-life data gathering situations, students have demonstrated deeper conceptual understanding and confidence in dealing with quantitative data. They have learned how to design and carry out all phases of scientific investigation. The pedagogical value of field-based small group projects has also been substantiated in other science courses such as environmental science (de Wet, 1994) and at other inland lake locations (Smith, 1995) A variety of field sites used include the volcanic lakes located in Newberry National Volcanic Monument, the scenic reach of the Deschutes River located near the college, and South Slough National Estuarine Reserve located on the southern Oregon coast. The field based approach enables students to receive high quality, intellectually stimulating educational experiences and engages them in the collection of meaningful scientific data, provides opportunities for students to apply their knowledge to solving realistic problems in science, and increases student confidence with modern technology including quantitative applications. The target audience includes nontraditional students enrolled in K-12 education and applied science programs. Eighty to one hundred students annually participate in the affected courses. Student designed projects provide meaningful data with which to characterize and monitor the lakes, rivers and estuaries in Oregon. The success of this curriculum restructuring is assessed by using pre- and post- course concept inventory testing, similar to that used by Deslaughter (1998), project evaluation by the PI, peer evaluations, and train and trade exercises (Smith, 1995) used to gain familiarity with equipment. Exemplary projects are publicized through meetings and journals of American Geophysical Union and Geological Society of America. The framework of this curriculum restructuring is designed to be readily adapted to any lake, river or coastal environment and to a variety of scientific disciplines."

Worldwide, the market is growing steadily, with Japan leading the way and the United States coming in second. Oregon, Washington and California report nearly one-third of all EV/HEV ownership in the United States. There is wide recognition that current automotive training programs for students and technicians need to be dramatically redesigned to guarantee mastery of these emerging, advanced vehicle systems. The investigative team of this ATE project will address this need by working with selected automotive industry and community college partners to create a standardized approach for training and certifying electric drive technicians. Once completed, the proposed training standards will serve to spearhead a process with the long-term goal of instituting a licensing process for these highly skilled workers who are working with high voltage and high-pressure gaseous fuels. The project team will develop and implement outreach activities aimed at increasing the enrollment of underrepresented groups, including women, Latinos, and Native Americans, in automotive technology programs and career pathways at community colleges. Emphasis will be placed on disseminating and sharing all products and outcomes at national meetings and through a website that will be developed to highlight this project. <br/><br/>The project will identify training categories for electric drive vehicle maintenance and safety. A template will be created for each training category that defines the associated training activities. The overall goal being to develop standardized training for electric drive technicians. Simultaneously, the investigative team will work with content area and industry experts to develop a method to validate skills acquisition. Digital badges will be considered as one way to credential learner outcomes. The training standards and credentialing system will be vetted by industry and educator team members and upon approval, the standards and credentialing system will be tested at 10 businesses and 20 community colleges. Outcomes and training materials will be shared regionally and nationally with appropriate organizations and stakeholders. Once a framework for training and credentialing has been validated by these organizations, the investigative team will meet with governmental agencies in the Western States to discuss the institutionalizing of licensing procedures for electric drive technicians. In the United States, there is currently no standardized credential or licensure requirement for technicians who work with high voltage systems and high-pressure gaseous fuels. As a point of comparison, technicians who work with commercial or residential high voltage or heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems must be licensed by each State.  The same must also be done for EV/HEV technician who work with high voltage systems and high-pressure gaseous fuels."

Teamwork, technology, creative and critical thinking, and communication skills are crucial to success in today's professional world. To ensure better prepared students, the Mathematics Department at Central Oregon Community College (COCC) implemented major curriculum reforms which foster skills so crucial to success. This comprehensive reform effort involves developing and incorporating various interactive/experiential formats across the curriculum. Central to this reform program is the creation of the Mathematics Activity Resource Center (MARC). Project funds are being used to equip the MARC with computers and other instructional aids. The MARC greatly facilitates activities that encourage teamwork, discovery, learning-by exploration, open-ended group projects, and technical writing. The MARC enhances the learning environment for all math students at COCC by providing a setting physically separate from the traditional classroom. In addition, the MARC serves as a district-wide resource for strengthening mathematics education at all levels. The key components COCC is addressing in its mathematics reform project include: development of a cooperative learning environment; integration of hands-on activities to promote skills and concepts; implementation of interactive/experiential activities; introduction of modern technologies and innovative educational methodologies; involvement of faculty department-wide; incorporation of realistic and open-ended problems; and, promotion of technical writing skills."

One of the express goals of introductory physics courses is to prepare students to apply physics to the world around them. Students should be capable of thoughtfully performing back-of-the-envelope calculations to reach valid conclusions about physics as it is observed. Rarely, if ever, do teachers validate this skill by testing students. The outcomes of those tests that have been employed are disappointing. Therefore, this department is developing methods to ensure greater student skill in these estimation processes. If students are going to learn to make valid estimations, they need to practice. It is crucial that they have quick feedback about the accuracy of their estimates. To this end, eight computer-based data acquisition systems are being used along with suitable probes and modeling software. Together with structured learning activities, this hardware provides the immediate feedback that is needed to develop student skills in estimation. Simple modeling exercises enable the students to discover which aspects of the problem are most critical. Because of the growing numbers of physics classes with access to microcomputer based labs (MBL), the tools and resources developed are easily transportable to schools nationwide."
