Forty-four scholarships for full tuition and books are being awarded to low-income, academically talented students with special efforts to recruit women, disabled, and ethnic minority students. To increase retention and program completion, an infused system of supports and experiences spans the recipients' time in the program. Each scholarship recipient receives mentoring and tutoring, participates on a number of field trips to industry sites, attends presentations by industry leaders, and completes an integrated capstone project of applied learning. Mentoring is provided by the highly-qualified and industry-standard faculty at Chemeketa and tutoring by certified tutors. On site visits Silicon Forest Scholars hear presentations from each of the Silicon Forest industry partners, including Intel Corporation, Cisco Systems Incorporated, Pittsburgh Plate Glass, and ISM Group. The State of Oregon is presenting informational sessions for the recipients. During the integrated capstone project at the end of the scholarship term, recipients complete an academically demanding applied learning project from their individual fields of study. These provide opportunities for hands-on, experiential learning that will prepare students for work in the high-tech industry. The program expects to retain 90% of SFS recipients each year of the project and to graduate 85% of SFS recipients in their fields of study. Furthermore, the program provides assistance with a goal of ensuring that 95% of SFS graduates are employed in their field of study or transfer to a four-year college or university to continue their field of study. In addition to striving for these graduation and successful transfer goals, the SFS program is enhancing networks between Chemeketa Community College, local, national, and international industry, and four-year schools; strengthening partnerships between institutions of higher education and related employment sectors; and increasing its focus on the needs of industry and on cross-disciplinary studies that enhance student learning and worksite readiness.<br/>"

To address this important national issue, Chemeketa Community College in Oregon will collaborate with food and beverage processors and processing equipment manufacturers to develop a new education program for manufacturing systems technicians. The goal is to develop an industry-driven program with stackable certificates embedded in a two-year associate degree, and with clear pathways to employment in high wage fields and/or a baccalaureate degree. As courses are developed, the project will use a work-based learning model that allows employees to engage both in the classroom and on the job.  In this way, employees and employers can immediately benefit from the new skills and knowledge that the employees are learning. This industry-driven project is designed to develop a prototype that could be useful regionally and nationally for addressing technician education in other areas such aerospace and technology manufacturing, both growing manufacturing sectors with large existing companies. <br/><br/>Project activities will include conducting a DACUM (Developing a Curriculum), the occupational analysis process developed by Ohio State University that is used extensively in developing two-year college workforce programs. Based on the DACUM results, programs and courses in current associate degree technician programs at the institution will be reorganized and modified to fit the needs of the cross-sector group of industry partners.  As needed, new courses will be created to meet industry-specific requirements. For example, industry partners have indicated that they increasingly use automated processes and robots to improve quality of products and reduce costs. To accommodate these changes in manufacturing processes, this project will research, develop, and disseminate curriculum to prepare workers with the skills and knowledge to set up, operate, test, and maintain these machines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The experiments are specifically targeted at distance learning courses where very few physics laboratory opportunities exist. This lack of access to gateway laboratory courses limits students' educational opportunities across all STEM disciplines. This particularly hampers entry to working adults seeking to upgrade their education, students in remote locations, and the mobility-impaired. Equipment costs further limit accessibility for those unable to attend a traditional campus setting. The labs will make use of an inexpensive prototype device and software known as IOLab that allows measurement of a wide variety of physical parameters.  The project will measure the learning gains of the labs as well as student attitudes toward them.  <br/><br/>There is a tremendous need for research-validated distance laboratory experiences of high quality, especially in physics. This project plans to address this need by using the inexpensive IOLab tool for Newtonian mechanics in the introductory calculus and algebra-based physics courses. The primary goal of the project is to develop, implement, test, and disseminate a complete set of low-cost, research-validated, distance-learning labs. Two secondary goals are to assess student attitudes toward these labs (studying the differences and similarities in these between distance learning and on-campus implementations) and to provide useful input for improvement of the introductory laboratory learning experience for all. The use of the commercial IOLab hardware and software mitigates the cost and technical risk, making widespread adoption among colleges and universities both feasible and likely. The IOLab also makes it feasible to implement a more constructivist learning approach in the entire course, by incorporating hands-on activities prior to the in-class or distance learning lecture portion. Dissemination will include reports on the learning outcomes and pedagogy presented at conferences and it is hoped that eventually the method can be expanded and used beyond the introductory laboratory. The distance learning laboratory approach will serve as a model for other science disciplines and provide a transformational opportunity for making quality physics laboratory experiences available to a large number of students."
