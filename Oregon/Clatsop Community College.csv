Water out of the system is suitable for reuse. This emerging ecologically friendly and economically sound system looks like a large greenhouse, but is also a hands-on science laboratory. The Living Machine has tremendous and, as yet, untapped research and educational potential. This project introduces high school and college students to environmental technology through the use of the educational and research potential of the Living Machine. Integration of technology with science education and research encourages students to pursue technology-related occupations. This project 1) designs and implements an enriched hands-on lab science curriculum that utilizes the ecology of the Living Machine, and gives students an introduction to environmental technology; 2) develops an independent lab science course centered around the Living Machine technology; 3) partners with area high schools to encourage use of Living Machine as a living classroom (to include curriculum development and teacher preparation); 4) partners with 2 and 4 year colleges/universities to develop short courses or projects centered around the Living Machine technology; 5) develops research showing the Living Machine is as effective as conventional systems in treating wastewater; and 6) designs and implements research to answer questions regarding wastewater and wetland ecology."

This is being accomplished by incorporating a series of new investigations using contemporary computer technology into the curriculum. Microcomputers are used to perform data collection and graphing in the areas of force, motion, temperature, and radiation. The microcomputers are used to provide immediate feedback for student analysis of data, which stimulates them to experiment on their own with a larger number and variety of trials, to discover relations in the physical world. Six networked Microcomputer Based Labs (MBLs) have been obtained, all of which are equipped with a Universal Lab Interface (ULl), appropriate sensors and software. A master MBL station equipped with a high resolution Monitor, SuperDrive, modem and power source has also been obtained. This equipment is revitalizing the physics and Integrated Technologies programs at CCC, and is providing the necessary technology to further the college's stated mission to prepare physics students to meet the challenges of science in the next century. This project is encouraging students to continue to study and support science by improving their experiences with physics. ***y"

Experiments will emphasize observation, measurement, organization and analysis of data, and hypothesis formulation and testing. Students will employ electrophoresis, spectrophotometry, and centrifugation to investigate topics in biotechnology and molecular biology, genetics, and environmental biology. Students will use networked Macintosh workstations to and computer-based instrumentation to investigate a variety of physiological conditions, as well as to process and graph data. The new laboratory environment will foster scientific inquiry and will help students develop critical thinking skills. Students also will use computer-based post laboratory simulations to reinforce lecture and laboratory activities. As well, computer augmented instruction will afford a flexibility to better meet the needs of our single and working parents. Faculty will use the Macintosh server as a workstation to develop simulations supporting laboratory materials. Published reports and presentations on the results of this project will stimulate other community colleges to lab investigations modeled on those from this project."
