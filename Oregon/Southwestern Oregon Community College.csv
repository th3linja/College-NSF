The principal goal is to increase opportunities for students to                 perform a wider variety of experiments using appropriate                        laboratory equipment and to enhance learning through physics                    simulations using microcomputers.                                                                                                                                    The focus will be on single topic labs keyed to Physics                    lecture material.  A commitment to new equipment, including                     computers, will update and enhance existing laboratory equipment.               Computer simulations of various physics experiments enhance                     understanding of more complex general physics concepts which are                not possible to investigate in the laboratory - such as the                     motion of many bodies under gravity, or electric fields in                      complicated geometrics - while introducing students to computer                 use in a scientific setting.                                                                                                                                         The college with match the award with an equal amount of                   funds."

The AA is being used by students to study the phytoremediation of heavy metals by plants as a means for environmental detoxification.  Analytical methods from both the educational and research literature are being adapted for use in the project.  Using the AA, General Chemistry students are conducting ongoing research projects that are providing them with experience with the scientific method and that are allowing them to experience the interconnectivity between chemistry and biology.  An artificial marsh is being utilized by students to research the effects of various physical parameters on the uptake of heavy metals by plants and to screen local marsh plants for their ability to hyperaccumulate heavy metals.  After incorporating the AA and the research studies into the General Chemistry lab curriculum, the project will be expanded to include faculty who teach in the areas of physical science, biology and geology at both the college and local high schools."
