The program is educating individuals to work in the growing number of aquariums, ornamental fish enterprises, aquaculture facilities, and marine recreation and interpretative centers in the Pacific Northwest and throughout the country. <br/><br/>As an Advanced Technology Education (ATE) Adaptation and Implementation Project, Oregon Coast Community College is:<br/>(a) Reviewing and adapting curricula on Fisheries Technology developed by Northwest Center for Sustainable Resources (DUE 981315) and aquarist curricula developed by Marine Advanced Technology Education Center (DUE 9752028);<br/>(b) Developing additional curriculum specific to aquarium technology and marine interpretation using the DACUM ( Developing A CurriculUM ) process;<br/>(c) Submiting and receiving approval for the AAS degree from the Oregon Department of Education, Division of Professional/Technical Education;<br/>(d) Enrolling 25 students in the program in each of years two and three of the grant;<br/>(e) Developing articulation agreements with Oregon State University and other four-year institutions to facilitate successful transition to related bachelor's degree programs; and<br/>(f) Sponsoring annual marine education and career institutes for high school students. These institutes give 100 students per year the opportunity to explore careers in aquatic life support, aquatic animal husbandry and health, and marine interpretation.<br/><br/>The project is accomplishing these tasks with the assistance of local and national partners. The partners provide technical expertise, training facilities, and internship opportunities for students. Local partners include the Oregon Coast Aquarium, the Bureau of Land Management, the Port of Newport, private nature-based tourist enterprises, and the Oregon State University Hatfield Marine Science Center, which includes Oregon State University's Marine Science program, Extension Sea Grant and research facilities for the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Association, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. A National Science Foundation funded nation-wide survey indicated strong employer demand for a technical training program of this nature."

Access is through the highly successful Aquarium Science Program. S-STEM funds support 19 two-year, financial need scholarships. The project is  making a special effort to recruit traditionally under-represented students from urbanized areas and Title 1 schools to receive this strong scientific and technical training. Recruiting utilizes digital technology through granted access to post scholarship information on the websites of national organizations and their chapters, including the NAACP, SCANAS, and MESA. Student support strategies promote academic success and retention through individual academic advising, team building activities, and direct interaction with industry professionals."

Based on the survey results, the project is developing outlines of potential academic programs that are of interest to the local and national industry and examining existing curricular materials to determine what materials can be adapted for this purpose and what new materials need to be developed."
