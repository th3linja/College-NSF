To counter this trend, the project develops contextualized lessons in math with the aim of enhancing student math skills. This project will test whether increased content relevance boosts course retention and academic progress. Based on work at several institutions, the project seeks to improve pedagogical approaches, course design, female and minority student participation, and course articulation at this college and with the region's fourteen local high schools. The work will focus on applied math in five career technical areas (CTE) to 1) develop a one-term community college and a year-long high school math course with contextualized algebra and geometry concepts; 2) conduct an in-depth summer math institute based on the curriculum for regional high school, community college, and industry teaching professionals; 3) integrate the math course into all CTE college curricula; and 4) use the course for dual credit that satisfies State of Oregon diploma requirements as a third-year high school math course."

The Advanced Technological Education program provides students with the skills they need for adaptive, innovative technological careers and which require math competencies. This project, based on the success of a previous award (DUE ATE  1002822), is increasing high school and community college student math skills so students are better prepared for post-secondary education and, ultimately, for work as career technical education (CTE) technicians.  Objectives for the project include: developing and piloting a Contextualized Algebra II community college course (Math 67) and textbook; providing the curriculum to high schools with algebra, geometry, graphing, and statistical concepts driven by contextualized applications from five CTE and STEM areas (Automotive, Diesel, Manufacturing, Electronics, and Construction); conducting targeted recruitment of veterans, women, and minority students for this new curriculum; providing math tutoring; offering three Summer Math Institutes (SMI) each for up to 25 high school and community college math and CTE teachers; and facilitating formation of professional learning communities for teachers and faculty in the SMIs for ongoing e-based support and for sharing of curriculum and materials. External evaluation is being used to determine the effectiveness of the contextualized curriculum in developing math skills, compared to the traditional course as a control group. The developed curriculum is being disseminated via the project website, the summer institutes, regional workshops, and presentations at national conferences."
