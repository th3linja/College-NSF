Providing Information Technology two-week internships in regional businesses during the summer for secondary and post-secondary instructors.<br/>2. Allowing instructors to keep their curriculum current by accessing training available on-line or at industry-sponsored conferences and educational seminars.<br/>This project expands the academic preparation of information technology teachers from the classroom to the ""real world"" of work. Interaction with business and industry will enable instructors to bring that ""world"" back into the classroom for more relevant and meaningful experiences for both high school and college students by integrating real world scenarios into the classroom. The business experience by instructors is the piece missing in the training of regional instructors. By integrating business and industry contacts with secondary and post-secondary education in the 11,000 square mile region, participants will learn how business and education can partner for the benefit of students in a rural, isolated area."

Implementation involved acquisition of Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR), a modern ultraviolet-visible recording spectrophotometer (UV-VIS), two gas chromatographs (GC) and other accessories. Student have direct hands-on experience with these instruments and have acquired skill in interpreting the measurements they provide. FTIR and UV-VIS are used for molecular structure determination and have allowed enhanced knowledge of structure/property interrelationships. The new instruments are used in conjunction with computer-assisted molecular graphics and molecular mechanics methods. New student exercises have been implemented which take advantage of the increased capabilities of the equipment. GC is a valuable adjunct to these methods because it allows rapid separation, identification, and quantification of organic substances. The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to the NSF funds."
