Faculty and students will benefit from access to the resources of the Internet, including libraries and supercomputers. In addition, they will be able to communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of research and educational projects. The award provides partial support of the project for two years."

The opportunity for students' active involvement in a laboratory setting is essential and the absence of modern equipment will adversely affect their attitudes to physics courses. In order to provide a contemporary laboratory capability, the equipment includes computer interface units, smart pulley system and sonic range finder, wave analysis system, precision interferometer, thermodynamics quantitative measurement system, equipment to measure charge to mass ratio, Franck/Hertz critical potentials and electron diffraction, and an electron spin resonance experimental system. The project will provide new and revised laboratory experiments and lecture demonstrations. In addition, it will introduce this capability across other academic disciplines and support a program designed to improve quality of mathematics and science instruction for local teachers in grades 7-12. The college will match the award with an equal amount."
