The primary goal of the program is to increase the number of talented but financially disadvantaged residents of the region to achieve higher education degrees in STEM programs. This project will focus on the recruitment and retention of these students to degree achievement.  It builds upon a comprehensive infrastructure for mentoring students and providing intensive, continuous intervention strategies. The active participation of business and industry partners will enhance internship/research opportunities, as well as facilitate placements in the high technology industry. The project aims to provide academic support services to ensure 80% achieve an average GPA of 3.0 each semester; to graduate 80% of S-STEM students in the top 30% of their graduating class; and to achieve an 80% success rate in the number of transfer program participants who obtain admittance to a senior institution or obtain job placement within 12 months of graduation.  The project will benefit the Southwest Virginia region which faces substantial economic challenges and is forced to change its economic base.   It seeks to meet the demand for graduates in fields such as engineering and informatics which will be critical to developing a New Economy for the region."

The target audience is high achieving high school students; marginal high school students who demonstrate an exceptional interest in the science, math or engineering fields; adult learners who are already enrolled in programs at the college; and returning adult students who have been away from science, engineering, or mathematics studies for several years.  <br/><br/>The primary objectives include increasing participation and retention of academically talented, low-income students and underrepresented groups; assessing the academic, educational and communications skills of participants and preparing Individual Training Portfolios for each; facilitating the personal and professional development of students by establishing partnerships with industry for mentors, job shadowing, internships, or research experiences; increasing involvement in Career Center job placement activities; providing academic and support services for increased student retention and improved academic performance; and increasing the placement of participating students in baccalaureate transfer programs and related employment.<br/><br/>The scholars participate in a wide range of retention-related activities utilizing an exemplary student services program. Students who require remediation will participate in a special program to accelerate learning, however, once they enter the program, they are expected to maintain high academic standards. In addition, second-year scholarship recipients are encouraged to provide tutoring to entering CSEMS students. Scholars also have an opportunity to participate in a Summer Technology Institute that includes field trips to engineering and information technology industries in the region and to four-year schools with whom the institution has articulation agreements in engineering and information technology majors. <br/><br/>In addition, each student is assigned a M.A.S.T.E.R. Advisor who serves as the Faculty Mentor and a Big Brother/Big Sister mentor from a business or industry related to the major of the student. The Alumni Office is establishing an Adopt A Student mentorship program to encourage volunteer alumni from business and industry to participate as Big Brothers/Big Sisters to the scholars. A CSEMS Club allows networking among  scholarship recipients, provides a monthly lecture series with industry representatives as guest speakers, provide workshop opportunities on topics such as job search strategies and resume preparation, and provide opportunities for participant input and feedback. This project serves as a model for other community colleges in areas where high numbers of unemployment has forced entire regions to change their economic base.<br/><br/>"

In addition, each student is assigned a faculty advisor and a Big Brother/Big Sister mentor from a related business or industry. The project builds on a successful Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarship (CSEMS) project that had outstanding results. This program has a comprehensive infrastructure for mentoring students and providing intensive, continuous intervention strategies. The active participation of business and industry partners enhances internship/research opportunities, as well as facilitates placements in the high technology industry.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: This project has been designed to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups through the provision of programs and activities with proven results. Groups targeted include females, minorities, persons with disabilities, low-income, and geographically disadvantaged populations. Selection criteria are designed to accommodate applicants who come from diverse backgrounds and have diverse career goals. Seeking to improve the quality, quantity, and diversity of students entering the STEM programs, a regional Summer Technology Institute is being offered to rising 11th and 12th graders and S-STEM scholars. The summer program advances discovery and understanding in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and promotes and encourages new teaching, training, and learning strategies. Overall, the potential benefits of the project are significant to a region facing substantial economic challenges and forced to change its economy by seeking to meet the demand for graduates in fields such as engineering and informatics which are critical to developing a New Economy for the region."
