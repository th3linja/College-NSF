The similarities in the production  process between the biochip and the microchip place the proposed biochip curriculum directly in parallel with curricular programs that already exist for microelectronics and electronics.  Currently, there are no known comprehensive curricular programs at the community college level to address the workforce development needs, competencies and skills for the biochip industry, although these gene chips are already in production at several companies and in limited use in the medical profession.  This pilot project brings together national academic and industrial experts in biotechnology, biochip technology and microchip technology to build the foundation for a biochip science and technology curriculum that interfaces with existing microelectronics, electronics, and engineering programs being offered at many community colleges.  J. Sargent Reynolds Community College (JSRCC), in close coordination with faculty from the School of Engineering at Virginia Commonwealth University, is leading the project.  In addition, JSRCC is developing and coordinating the project using science and technology faculty from the Virginia, Maryland, and West Virginia community college systems.  Activities that support the development and dissemination of this unique biochip specialization are:  1) travel to biochip and microchip industries and biotechnology firms in Arizona, California, and Texas to meet experts involved in these industries and to invite them to join this project as part of a Curriculum Exploration and Development Team; 2) sponsorship of a Fall 1999 workshop entitled, ""Bioelectronics, Biosensors, and Biochips"" in Richmond, VA, for community college faculty from the three CC systems involved; and 3) hosting workshops to delineate competencies, skills and workforce development needs in the biochip industry and to produce biochip specialization courses.  This multidisciplinary program will provide the framework for a national curriculum model for other institutions interested in offering a curriculum that will prepare workers for careers in the biochip, microchip, and biotechnology fields."

This results in an increasing demand for highly skilled automotive technicians to maintain and repair these complex systems.  Currently, training for testing and repair of these systems is limited to manufacturer and dealer channels.  A large unmet demand in the secondary repair market exists.  J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College (JSRCC) in collaboration with City College of San Francisco, Southside Virginia Community College and James Madison University will develop three courses in advanced vehicle control systems including laboratory exercises, pilot the courses in traditional class format, and refine, convert and deliver them in distance learning format.  The project will also provide students with applied research experience and disseminate the results nationwide.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include developing course and laboratory materials that can be adopted by other institutions, spurring the training of advanced vehicle control technologies in two-year schools nationwide,  and addressing the unmet demand for high-tech automotive technicians.  The project plans to host statewide conference to demonstrate the programs and laboratories in Virginia and California.  A national web-based symposium will also be developed to facilitate the dissemination of the project results.  Presentations will be given in regional and national conferences."

Sargeant Reynolds Community College (JSRCC) in Richmond, Virginia, is to increase the number, quality, and diversity of teachers in the College's service area, especially in mathematics, science, and technology.  The project is providing pathways to teaching careers for students, particularly prospective technology teachers, who will be recruited from among middle and high school students, including those from technical centers, and JSRCC students in AS math and science and AAS programs.  JSRCC graduates will seek baccalaureate degrees and teacher licensure at three nearby universities.   <br/>     Project activities include the development of the JSRCC Career Education (Teaching) course as a dual enrollment course and for online delivery targeting high school students, particularly those in technical centers.   During two summers, Middle School Summer Camps will recruit students into the teaching field and provide opportunities for JSRCC pre-service teachers to be immersed in teaching.  A Math/Science Practicum will engage JSRCC students in seminars and in math and science tutoring in Richmond City Public Schools.  Two manuals and three videos will provide students with essential education information.  AAS students at JSRCC will be encouraged to become teachers in their technology area and to transfer and seek teacher licensure.  Other features of the project include on-site advising in the high schools, campus visits and mentorships, all designed to provide a smooth transition and articulation for high school students coming to the JSRCC.  Six new courses will be developed for pre-service teachers.  Scholarships will be offered to high school students and to JSRCC graduates.  Collaborations between JSRCC and three area universities will enable the development of pathways for AAS graduates to receive the baccalaureate degree. <br/>"

Both Computer Science (CS) and Information Technology (IT) academicians and practitioners agree that a comprehensive strategy to improve the number and quality of 21st century CS/IT workforce is needed.  This project will assist colleges and universities in producing more well-qualified software developers through the use of a cyberlearning environment that builds on and extends WReSTT-CyLE (Web-Based Repository of Software Testing Tutorials), a cyberlearning environment for software testing. <br/><br/>The project will: (1) investigate the impact that students' use of WReSTT-CyLE, at a cross-section of academic institutions, has on their software testing skills; (2) develop a theoretical framework of learning and engagement strategies that best support improvement of students' knowledge and skills in software courses for diverse student groups; (3) transform WReSTT-CyLE into a domain-independent cyberlearning environment for software and programming courses (SEP-CyLE) and repeat (1) above using SEP-CyLE for software courses; and (4) conduct biannual workshops to expose instructors to how SEP-CyLE may be used in the classroom to support pedagogy. The research in (1) will include mixed methods studies with both qualitative and quantitative components."
