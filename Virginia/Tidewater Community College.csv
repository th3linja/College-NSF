The ATC is located on Tidewater Community College's (TCC) Virginia Beach Campus. This center is described as the most advanced joint workforce/technology project in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The ATEDP brings together an initial consortium of Tidewater Community College, the Virginia Beach City Public Schools, the regional workforce investment board, three manufacturing business partners, and the City of Virginia Beach to create shared curricula and materials for science and engineering technology students in both high school and college. <br/><br/>The ATEDP improves the learning environment, course content and learning experiences each year for 850 to 1,000 Virginia Beach high school students enrolled at the ATC in CADD, industrial engineering technology, and information systems technologies. New curricula and materials in the area of Metrology, as well as the above technology areas, are also being used for about 800 Tidewater Community College students. The ATEDP provides intensive shared professional development and technical experiences for high school and college faculty in collaboration with the industrial employers. The new curriculum and educational materials are being developed for articulated placement of students, dual enrollment and distance education courses. High school students in these curricula are able to earn a minimum of 12 credits toward an associate degree while attending the ATC. TCC faculty are involved in completing laboratory-intensive course content, including a distance education component, for a recently approved metrology curriculum. The employer partners are providing mentored, on-site internships for students, while the workforce investment board continues to develop new employer partners, particularly in manufacturing. <br/><br/>Outcomes/deliverables include:<br/>1) curricula for articulated and/or dual enrollment courses, targeted to the industry<br/>standard, which enables high school students to earn a minimum of 12 college<br/>credits toward A.A.S. degrees in Industrial/Manufacturing Engineering Technology,<br/>Information Systems Technology, Computer Aided Drafting and Design or related<br/>options of the A.A.S. degree in Technical Studies, while they are completing their<br/>high school diplomas.<br/>2) content for a laboratory-intensive metrology curriculum and at least six new or<br/>upgraded modules for other courses in the identified curricula not scheduled for<br/>implementation as dual enrollment and/or articulated courses.<br/>3) relevant, mentored, 80-hour or longer work site experiences for both high school<br/>and other TCC students.<br/>4) an 80 percent pass rate for those students who attempt regional and national<br/>certifications after completing the relevant courses and taking the certification<br/>exams.<br/>5) detailed plans for implementing the reforms in the other three school systems in the<br/>college service area and for disseminating them nationally."

S degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) prepared for transfer to B. S. programs. <br/> <br/>The objectives of the project include:              <br/>1. Persistence to graduation. 115 women, who would not have been able to graduate in STEM majors, graduate.  <br/>2. Retention of women.  Retention of women students in STEM classes rises from the present level of 74% to 85%. <br/>3. Recruitment. The number of women enrolled in STEM disciplines rises from current levels of 40% to 59%, their proportion of the college population. <br/>4. Academic and career success. Long-term tracking shows that 60% of participants are persisting at the transfer college and entering their chosen profession. <br/> <br/>Project participants are being tested to assure that they are in the best program for their interests and abilities.  They receive both academic advising and intervention counseling. Trained supplementary instruction leaders as well as mentors are available to all participants.  Participants meet regularly in a support group for career guidance and transfer assistance. STEM faculty attend annual workshops to receive training in how to create a female-friendly classroom and select materials intrinsically interesting to women; faculty are also be helped to improve their academic advising.  During their final semester, students take an experiential capstone course in women's work in which they regularly shadow a professional in their field. <br/> <br/>Intellectual Merit: This project addresses a seldom-studied problem which is low graduation rates for bright, at risk, community college women who wish to enter STEM professions. The project builds on special assistance efforts taking place at this large, urban community college. Strategies to be employed include those which have succeeded with other populations at this college and at other colleges, but which are combined in a new form and with the addition of a newly created hands-on course for students in their last semester.  Faculty workshops by an experienced trainer from an institution that has warmed its chilly classrooms for women are being carried out each year until all full-time STEM faculty are trained.  <br/> <br/>Broader Impacts: By creating a model program to benefit smart, at-risk community college women, the goals are to not only improve the environment for the college's women to succeed, but also to create materials and a replicable model that would pave the way to success in science, math, engineering, and technology for the many non-traditional college women whose only avenue to STEM professions is through the first line of access to higher education, the community college. <br/>"
