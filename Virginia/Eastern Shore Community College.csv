This project addresses a weakness in short-term training programs that may prepare individuals for immediate employment, but do not serve students in earning more advanced degrees required for promotion to higher paying jobs within their chosen trade. As a result of this project, students enrolling in trade programs will have tracks available in a Technical Studies associate's degree to efficiently utilize classes already taken and to progress in clearly laid out pathways towards a degree that is customized. A key emphasis of the project is also on recruiting and retaining students who are typically underrepresented in STEM fields. Since the demographics and employer needs of Eastern Shore Community College align closely with those of other rural community colleges, and since the service area conditions of high poverty and unemployment and low levels of educational attainment are common, the pathways created may serve as a model to impact other regions nationally. <br/><br/>More specifically, the Creating Technical Scholars (CTS) program will create a seamless transition from secondary through post-secondary education to employment in STEM fields and high-tech positions. The model will include stacked credentials, internships, business/industry-designed curriculum, capstone experiences, and articulation agreements with baccalaureate institutions.  The model will increase student success and boost economic development by increasing the number of workers and improving skill level, while meeting the needs of employers. There are four overarching project objectives which include: (1) To design dual enrollment technical tracks in career and technical education programs, allowing students to earn simultaneous high school and college credit as well as complete a career studies certificate in technical and occupational programs (Industrial Tech., Computer Tech., HVAC, and Electronics) during their junior and senior years. (2) To create a Technical Studies associates degree with tracks in Cybersecurity, Industrial Technology, HVAC, Welding, and Electricity as a means of targeting dual enrollment and certificate completion student in order to establish a pathway to upper division studies. (3) To establish articulation agreements with regional four-year institutions in technical study fields so as to optimize the educational pathway of students who want to transition from a 2-year degree to a 4-year degree. (4) To devise career tracks for students to begin careers in technical study fields after receiving a post-secondary credential.  In this regard, the project leverages local business/industry partners, who will work with Eastern Shore Community College to provide work-based learning experiences, including internships, job-shadowing, discipline-related conferences, and skills competitions, in high-demand technical fields."

It is also providing on-site faculty professional development at the nearby NASA Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) and the Navy Surface Combat Systems Center (SCSC) to enhance faculty understanding of aerospace and defense industry education needs. It is building on a successful American Association of Community College (AACC) Mentor Links ReConnect project supported by NSF. The internship program initiated through that effort is being further developed and enhanced into a scalable model using LEAN principles to maximize efficiency and provide the best value and outcomes for students and industry customers.<br/><br/>The primary project audiences are students enrolled in AAS degree programs in Electronics Technology; Electronics Technology: Computer Technician Specialization; and Business Technology: Information Systems Technology Specialization. Other eligible programs include Certificate Programs in Computer-Aided Drafting and Design; Electronics; Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning;  Industrial Maintenance Technology; Information Systems Technology; and Welding. The focus is on Career Pathways for STEM programs that provide science and engineering technicians for NASA WFF, Navy SCSSC, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and related aerospace and defense industry support contractors. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project is expanding and developing new internship pathways that prepare students for entry-level STEM careers. It is ensuring that local students have the opportunity to improve their technical education and motivating them to successfully complete credentials and obtain technological employment locally and in the broader world.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project is advancing knowledge and understanding within community college STEM programs by providing a model that builds industry partnerships and results in student internships and faculty professional development. These academic and industry partnerships are promoting teaching, training, learning, and diversity in the technical workforce and positively impacting the geographically isolated, low-income, and ethnically diverse population area served by the college both academically and economically."
