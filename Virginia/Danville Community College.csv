Polymer manufacturing science has been identified as one of the Institute's key areas. Danville Community College is developing and implementing an Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AMT) program offering workforce education and Associate of Applied Science degree opportunities in Polymer Manufacturing Technology. The goal is to educate students with high tech skills to enable them to become competitive and productive technicians. Articulation partnerships enable AMT graduates continue education at universities in the region. With previous funding, the program has purchased a Selective Laser Sintering machine. This project provides funds to purchase injection molding and extrusion training equipment to complement other equipment purchased with funds from the Virginia Tobacco Indemnification and Revitalization Commission. The equipment is essential to provide newly graduated high school students, incumbent workers, and workers displaced form the textile and tobacco industries with capabilities that closely simulate real world polymer manufacturing experiences."

The program is a third degree track in the college's Advanced Manufacturing Technology degree program (the other two tracks are Manufacturing Engineering Technology and Polymer Manufacturing Technology). <br/><br/>The new degree option is strongly supported by regional organizations and industry. The 42 project partners include 29 industry partners who are supporting curriculum development and/or are providing internship and employment opportunities for students. In addition to developing new curricula for this program, the college is adapting elements of a nanotechnology undergraduate program developed by project partner University of Virginia, which is also providing training equipment and curriculum development support. The primary audience for the new program is graduating high school seniors, as well as local adult workers who are seeking career re-training due to loss of a great number of the region's traditional jobs in textiles manufacturing and tobacco. <br/><br/>The Nanotechnology Education degree program is being managed by Danville Community College's Workforce Services and housed in its Regional Center for Advanced Technology and Training, a new 24,000-square-foot high-tech facility designed to support high-level scientific training programs such as nanotechnology education."

These programs are based on the development of new course materials and on the adaptation of curricula and courses from Sinclair Community College and the Pennsylvania College of Technology. The programs serve current manufacturing employees, employees who are newly entering the workforce or seeking a career change, and graduating high school students aspiring to develop essential technical career skills. Course content addresses critical workforce skills that have been identified by regional manufacturers. Articulation partnerships are established with Old Dominion University and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. These partners offer third- and fourth-year-level manufacturing technology courses for program graduates."
