There generally are not enough students to justify offering parallel lecture style classes at a given time to students with varying calculus proficiency.Workshop Physics is a teaching system in which students build their own understanding of physics by direct interaction with phenomena. Traditional lectures are replaced by guided hands-on activities for students working in small groups. Microcomputers interfaced with laboratory equipment allow for real-time measurements and immediate interpretation of results by the students.This project is resulting in an instructional design in which both calculus-based and non-calculus students learn physics in the same classroom/laboratory at the same time with one teacher using The Workshop Physics approach. Improved learning and better use of instructional resources are the outcomes.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal sources."

Additional interactive methods such as conceptual exercises, collaborative problem-solving, and multimedia technology will be incorporated into the existing Workshop Physics curriculum. This will result in improved student learning and more efficient use of instructor time."
