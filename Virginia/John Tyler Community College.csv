Therefore, the need for well-trained technicians to implement and maintain these high tech motor schemes is increasing dramatically. This project will enable John Tyler Community College to purchase the laboratory equipment necessary to implement successful training in industrial digital and computer control of motors, the work horses of modern industry. The equipment requested provides the students with a firm foundation in AC and DC motor theory, operating characteristics, and control theory. Training in power semiconductor control builds on this foundation. Modules equip the students with computer control experience using programmable logic controllers and direct digital computer control. This educational opportunity will enable graduates from the Electronics and Instrumentation programs to make a significant contribution to the industrial community."
