This region is also exceptional in that local manufacturers employ Rockwell Automation-based systems at a higher rate than nearby regions. Through this project, Central Virginia Community College (CVCC) will increase the rigor and competencies of manufacturing technician education in mechatronics with an emphasis on programmable logic controllers (PLCs). This project will focus on augmenting the Mechatronics AAS degree program at CVCC with Rockwell Automation PLC Maintainer Certifications. These certifications are industry recognized and valued by employers. Through targeted outreach, the mechatronics program will work closely with regional secondary school systems and local advanced manufacturing industries to provide middle-school students with the opportunity to directly experience mechatronics and advanced manufacturing. This will build a pipeline to the college to develop and train the workers needed to sustain and grow the sector.<br/><br/>This project will support mechatronics technician training for the growing advanced manufacturing industry by 1) enhancing course content and technical experiences for students, 2) providing comprehensive professional development for technician educators, and 3) developing educational pathways to support student recruitment, retention, and completion from middle school to college. New equipment and revised courses will strengthen the students' career pathway from the career studies certificate to the associate degree and into the workforce. Faculty will receive professional development in areas that directly impact technician education by providing the training necessary to offer certification testing on the purchased training equipment. Industry employers will engage with the program and its students in an integrated advisory role. Middle school students and college students will be engaged in collaborative learning opportunities to attract new talent and sustain the mechatronics technician pipeline through summer camp opportunities and joint problem-based learning projects. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Center is being designed to (a) provide leadership opportunities for educating science and engineering technicians to meet the growing demand for a highly skilled workforce in the national energy industry, utilizing the proven pipeline model which was piloted at Central Virginia Community College; (b) assist other institutions to adapt this model; and (c) serve as a clearinghouse for educational materials and research-based educational methods. The project focuses on the energy industry, defined as those organizations that are involved in the production and transmission of electric power, including fossil fuel, nuclear, and alternative energy. Planning activities include identifying the network leadership, developing regional partnerships, preparing partners to use the pipeline model, and securing all appropriate commitments."

Addressing this problem requires a transformative change in engineering education. Thus a long-term goal of this project is to make this transformation a reality across the nation. Short-term goals of the project include the development of Technology Leaders, a transportable interdisciplinary program that will prepare engineers and technicians to lead geographically-distributed teams in the designing and building of multiscale agile systems.  Building on prior work at the University of Virginia, Central Virginia Community College, and the Learning Factory at Penn State, the Technology Leaders program will integrate three elements: a new interdisciplinary, design-focused undergraduate curriculum; the hands-on Multiscale Agile Systems Technology Lab (MAST Lab); and applied summer educational experiences for students."

Activities address curriculum improvement, professional development for educators and technical experiences for high school students. A dual enrollment program in nuclear support technologies leads to an A.A.S. degree that includes an internship in industry and addresses industry competencies. The project improves STEM teaching skills for a large cadre of middle and high school teachers. A significant number of regional high school sophomores and seniors are assessed for industry competencies with recommendations for curriculum improvement made to their school systems. High school students in the program pass the STEM-related Virginia Standards of Learning (SOL) tests at significantly improved levels as required by the state. A replicable model is disseminated electronically, in print and via inter-active presentations at appropriate national conferences. Formative and summative evaluation by an outside evaluator uses a scientifically selected comparison group."
