The CIM cell will enable second year electronics students to perform laboratory experiments and receive training in robotics, vision systems, local area networks, programmable controllers, programming of CNC machines, troubleshooting individual systems, and every aspect of computer integrated manufacturing. The student will see and work with real world applications, making them more attractive and valuable employees to industry. The center will also be a resource for the Drafting and Design and the Machine Technology programs."

At the same time manufacturers recognize the importance of modernizing their processes to remain competitive in the global marketplace. The highly skilled workers that are needed to meet the changing demands of industries will have to be trained by community colleges or by industry itself. In response to this need, the proposed project seeks to improve the quality of advanced technological education provided by a consortium of five community colleges in southwestern Virginia The primary goal of the project is to enhance skills and knowledge of the faculty. The project consists of four primary activities including ""Back to Practice"" experiences for community college faculty, a ""Back to Practice"" regional study and dissemination conference, Conference/Workshop participation, and faculty development summer workshops focused on enhancing the curriculum development and student assessment skills of technical college faculty. The project will demonstrate that the individual strategies described in this proposal can be welded into a fully integrated process which assesses industry needs, relates these needs to required employee skills, defines the curricular material which establishes those skills, and provides quality training for students and industrial technicians in a timely fashion."

The project activities will serve as a model for rural appalachian colleges and will be coordinated through the Southwest Virginia Advanced Manufacturing Center, formed through a consortium of five community colleges. The project involves two components: 1) enhancement of faculty skills and knowledge to teach the advanced technologies required by AMT curricular courses via ""back- to-practice"" internships in industry and attendance at seminars and workshops, and 2) initial development of common AMT curricular courses by cross-disciplinary teams, comprised of faculty from the five participating community colleges, representatives from regional business and industry, and faculty from area high schools and senior institutions."
