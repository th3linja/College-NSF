The college is piloting several strategies to increase enrollment, retention, and job placement. Some of these strategies include establishing a technology consortium of local employers, faculty professional development for high school and community college faculty, and paid student internships. Best practices will be implemented, including targeted recruitment, to attract women and to maintain the current high percentages of minority students. Increased production of computer technicians is expected to make a positive impact on the economic success of the Central Virginia region. Project results will be shared with the Virginia Community College System and the NSF ATE community."

The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative educational resources."

Developing and maintaining a highly skilled workforce is a vital factor in sustaining a strong economy. This program responds to that need by training, educating, and certifying a technical workforce to international industry standards. The degree of collaboration among post-secondary faculty, technical educators, and industry is improved by this initiative and the pathway between secondary and post-secondary institutions is being strengthened. The student recruitment plan is carefully designed to attract and retain a diverse population. An organized effort is in place to disseminate the effective practices and outcomes resulting from this project to a broad audience.<br/><br/>This grant is working towards the following goals: developing an innovative education and training program in advanced manufacturing; enhancing the advanced manufacturing career pathway between secondary and post-secondary institutions; developing training capacity by establishing an advanced manufacturing lab, an open access curriculum, and project-based-learning (PBL) modules; and supporting regional economic development in advanced manufacturing. The program is being developed by incorporating the multiple fields of engineering technology into one integrated curriculum. The new courses provide students with a broad understanding of advanced manufacturing and the ability to apply the new knowledge in a lab environment that simulates the work environment. By educating students in this manner, as opposed to the usual route of focused training in one field, the industrial base is being presented with well-trained employees."

Research has identified the combination of elements that contribute to student success: completing the first two years of college with no loan debt, attending full time, taking a summer course, and reducing the need to work long hours after class. The scholarship funds reduce both unmet financial need and subsidized loan amounts for Scholars. Scholarships also are awarded for summer session.  As a result, there are increasing numbers of full-time students in the targeted academic plans and of SciTE Scholars returning to PVCC for a second year, graduating, and/or transferring to a four-year institution.<br/><br/>Faculty from STEM disciplines and staff from the Financial Aid Office and Student Services are selecting the SciTE Scholars and serving on an advisory committee. The faculty are rotating as facilitators of regular SciTE Scholar meetings. SciTE Scholars are visiting four-year institutions, working on interdisciplinary projects together in self-managed teams, and attending regional and national conferences.<br/><br/>The success of the scholarship program is evaluated by comparing the graduation and transfer rate of Scholars to non-Scholars in the same academic plans, by surveying Scholars annually, by interviewing Scholars who leave the program, and by tracking how many Scholars graduate from four-year institutions. Progress reports and outcomes are presented at national and regional conferences and at Peer Group meetings of community college faculty, and are being submitted for publication in refereed journals.<br/><br/>"

It is ensuring that all engineering students who transfer succeed at the four-year institution's engineering program and continue on to successful careers in research and industry. With the overarching goal of increasing the number of STEM students who earn credits toward transfer, graduate with an associate degree, and/or transfer to a four-year institution, the program is increasing the enrollment of entering engineering students by 10% each year and ensuring that 50% of students who enter the engineering degree program transfer to a four-year institution within the grant period. During the grant period, the project intends for at least 54 students to receive an A.S. in Engineering, 38 of whom transfer to a four-year institution; 54 to transfer before graduation; and 139 to be in the pipeline and earning credits toward a degree or transfer.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project is raising the visibility of the new engineering degree through established community events that are heavily promoted in the media, supported by area industries, and well-attended by high school students, parents, and industry representatives. The college is recruiting high achieving high school students through a coordinated series of events each spring and students who have been denied admission to four-year engineering programs. The college is also initiating a new pre-engineering curriculum for students arriving unprepared for the rigorous engineering program. This curriculum is being designed to reduce the number of semesters students spend in developmental education courses by instituting a Summer Academy to accelerate students' skills acquisition, so they are prepared for the engineering degree program in the fall. A dedicated STEM Student Liaison shepherds engineering students through the degree program, implements and maintains a new E-mentoring initiative, and connects students to industry. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: A comprehensive evaluation is being conducted, and results are being broadly disseminated. Students are participating in optional faculty-guided discovery projects that allow community college students to experience the excitement of investigation and to learn research methods. The college is negotiating new articulation or guaranteed admission agreements with several four-year institutions, continually refining current agreements, and continuing to update syllabi to maximize the number of credits that transfer."

The project goal is to increase the number and success of full-time science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students at the college. Core objectives are to recruit eligible students and achieve an 85 percent rate of advancement by SciTE Scholars. <br/><br/>The project builds on a prior award, which met the core objectives of the project by recruiting qualified students to fill all scholarship spots, achieving a 92 percent advancement rate for the scholarship students, and increasing enrollment of underrepresented groups to nearly 30 percent minority ethnicity and over 26 percent female. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the program lies in the combination of elements that research shows contribute to student success such as completing the first two years of college with no loan debt, attending full time, taking summer courses, and reducing the need to work long hours after class. The broader impact is advancing more STEM graduates to four-year institutions, including an increased number of traditionally underrepresented student groups. Employers benefit from a more qualified workforce and society from increased competitiveness and productivity of the American workforce in STEM fields."
