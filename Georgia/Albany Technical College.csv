From these discussions across the state, a renewed appreciation emerged of the critical need for a well-trained and educated workforce for industry growth and expansion. Because Albany Technical College (ATC) is one of the institutions responsible for educating Georgia's workforce, it is obligated to help plan and deliver educational programs that meet industry needs. This project will support changes to increase the effectiveness of the ATC Civil, Electrical and Computer, and Electromechanical Engineering Technology programs in educating highly skilled technical workers for industry.<br/><br/>This project will address the growing demand for skilled technicians and a diversified labor force. As a Predominately Black Institution, ATC has the potential to increase the participation of individuals from a group that has been underrepresented in many technical workforce areas.  Working with industry partners, ATC aims to educate students who can meet the demands of these partners for highly skilled employees.  Industry will assist faculty in placing students in internships and in evaluating student projects. Project-Based Learning and paid internships will be integrated into three engineering technology programs: 1) Civil Engineering Technology; 2) Electrical and Computer Technology (Telecommunications); and 3) Electromechanical Engineering Technology. The internships will enable students to apply classroom knowledge to the hands-on experiences.  In addition, students will work on real-world projects early in their program of study.  This strategy is expected to foster a climate in which they can see and achieve the ""end goal."" The project will address the following goals: (1) Increase enrollment, retention, and placement rates for Civil, Telecommunications, and Electromechanical Engineering Technology programs and (2) Strengthen existing partnerships with local employers. The project will also be disseminated to the secondary school program, ""Move On When Ready,"" and the ATC Engineering Prep Academy. Students in these programs will be supported to complete high school, continue their post-secondary education, and interact with local employers who will be looking to fill high demand technician positions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
