They are collectively known as the Voluntary Standards for the Chemical Process Industries Technical Workers. the U. S. Department of Education. These standards, described in ""Foundations for Excellence in the Chemical Process Industries"", identify 8 major work areas containing 564 industry-based competencies based on actual tasks performed by laboratory technicians. The new curriculum at Athens Areas Technical Institution in chemical technology integrates industry-based competencies into a workplace context for the education of chemical technicians. Specifically, the project is working with (1) Athens Waterworks and Olin Chemical Company to develop a basic scenario on the chemistry of aqueous systems: (2) Hoechst Celanese to develop a quality and process control laboratory associated the polymer synthesis; (3) Athens waterworks and Olin Chemical Company to develop a quality and process control laboratory for metal recovery; and (4) Hoechst Celanese to develop a quality control laboratory associated with a pharmaceutical company. Three of the four fully developed scenarios are being tested with students at Athens Area Technical Institution. The project is mapping a complete two-year program that includes outlines of seven workplace scenarios with their associated competencies. Dr. Kenneth Hughes at Kennesaw State University is developing the scenarios working closely with Dr. Hofstader to include appropriate components of the ACS Voluntary Standards and with Dr. White in the design, implementation, and testing of each scenario."

Exports from this sector grew by 19.8% in that year alone. Historically, machine tool technology has always been a foundational underpinning of manufacturing and this is especially true in the aerospace industry. While there is a national shortage of workers available with multi-axis CNC skills, and industry's demand for them is continuing to increase, the advanced training required to produce them remains unavailable. Professional development for machine tool instructors will directly address this problem by building the capacity for industry-recognized training at technical colleges and 4-year institutions involved in the Coalition of Machine Tool Technology Programs of Georgia (COMP-GA).<br/><br/>Athens Technical College (ATC) in conjunction with COMP-GA and Southern Polytechnic State University (SPSU) are creating a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) Advanced Multi-axis Programming (CAMP) certificate program, to enhance the quality of Georgia's machine tool technology programs. Machine tool instructors from majorly rural areas in Georgia are receiving formal training from the renowned Vincennes University (VU) in Indiana to help sharpen their expertise in the field. Instructors are learning how to set-up, program, and use advanced multi-axis CNC machines, to incorporate the industry-recognized certification in to their classroom curriculums. COMP-GA and SPSU are partnering with the Regional Advanced Machining Partnership (RAMP) and Central Maine Community College (CMCC) who are also NSF/ATE recipients currently developing an advanced machining certificate. The CAMP project is responding to industry needs for trained workers, and meeting the specific demands of the aerospace industry in Georgia. The CAMP project is disseminating knowledge among Georgia machine tool programs while providing a model for working with four-year institutions to determine best practices for technical education. Machine Tool educators are learning to sustain technical instruction and maintain relevancy in the field. The professional development activities are influencing curriculums designs, and participants are creating strong foundations and practices that are benefiting the workforce in Georgia. The partnership between COMP-GA and SPSU is increasing the participation of underrepresented groups, including women and minorities, as all students matriculating are accessing greater job opportunities with higher rates of pay."

The curriculum module development has been carried out in two phases. In the first phase, the project team developed and alpha tested three modules which address Aqueous Systems, Polymer Systems, and Metal Systems. During the second phase three additional modules on Drug Delivery Systems, Petroleum Energy Systems, and Remote Monitoring Systems were developed. Each laboratory module has a flexible design to facilitate integration into the first or second year of any two-year chemical technology program. All six modules have been field tested at ATC and Los Angeles Trade-Technical College.<br/><br/>The current project constitutes the final phase of work to complete the contextually-based, laboratory-driven curriculum. Specifically, this project is (1) field testing all six modules at 12 two-year technical colleges, (2) conducting two summer faculty training workshops for two-year college faculty to prepare for use of the curriculum materials at their sites, and (3) preparing and disseminating the modules, including student and instructors manuals in electronic and printed form for two-year chemical technology faculty as well as undergraduate chemistry faculty.<br/>"

They have a unique ability to make sense of subtle differences in the appearance of materials and the behavior of techniques and instruments. The challenge for chemical technology educators is to provide students with meaningful experiences that prepare them for these responsibilities. In 1998, the NSF awarded a grant to our institute to develop a model for a contextually-driven, laboratory-based curriculum in chemical technology. Three modules are being fully developed: the chemistry of aqueous systems, the chemistry of terrestrial systems, and the chemistry of polymer systems. A fourth module, the synthesis of modern drug release systems, is being outlined as well.<br/><br/>The project team is preparing to launch its final stage of development and alpha testing based upon promising feedback from students and faculty. This renewal proposal captures this momentum by: (1) fully developing and testing module 4, the synthesis of modern drug release systems; (2) developing two advanced-level modules focused on petroleum refining and computer-based data analysis; (3) beta testing modules 1,2,and 3; and (4) engaging in strategic dissemination. The previously assembled team (materials developer, project manager and Principal Investigator are continuing and a new partner (leading the beta testing) has been added. Both alpha and beta testing of the various modules developed are continuing. Beta testing is being carried out in a Chemical Technology program at a trade technical college. This activity is providing feedback as to the effectiveness of the modules. As a result of this renewal, the contextually-based, laboratory-driven curriculum will be completed. Discussions with commercial publishers have begun, ensuring that the curriculum will be disseminated and revised on an ongoing basis.<br/>"
