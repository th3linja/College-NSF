These higher education institutions educate nearly half of the nation's undergraduate students, particularly among low-income and first-generation students and students of color. Because of the rich diversity that currently exists at these institutional-types, there are immense opportunities to broadening participation throughout the engineering enterprise. To this end, the investigator outlines a joint collaboration with five community colleges, three school systems, two college career academies, and a state partner in Georgia - referred as the Georgia Science, Technology, and Engineering Partnerships for Success (GA STEPS) - to provide dual enrollment classes in career pathways for Georgia high school students in grades 9-12, thereby allowing secondary students to earn college credit. The Georgia STEPS program proposes to leverage mechatronics engineering as a means for broadening engineering participation for community colleges and underserved, underrepresented populations in 48 rural counties to increase engineering awareness, skills training and college and career readiness. The project builds on an existing collaboration that has developed successful engineering opportunities at the community college level, by including a wider regional network of rural Georgia counties and high schools. Further, this project has immense potential to transform engineering education and course-taking for students at the secondary and postsecondary level in Georgia and beyond. It has potential great potential to be scaled and replicated at other placed around the United States.<br/><br/>The project's intellectual merit and innovation is that it leverages a successful mechatronics engineering curriculum that supports engineering skills that support local industry as well as supporting innovations in the mechatronics field. The project includes a collective impact framework, involving various stakeholders and aligning quantitative and qualitative metrics and measurable objectives. The broader impacts of this project is that it increases the engineering knowledge and skills of underserved, underrepresented students that are enrolled in community colleges. Also, the impact to rural communities in Georgia support the fact that this project would meet broader groups that can be positively impacted by this type of collaborative. The ability to provide different parts of this engineering discipline across broad audiences in community colleges - that support underrepresented groups understanding of mechatronics engineering - is broadly useful to the field of engineering."

This integration of physical and digital systems is often called, Industry 4.0.  Examples of Industry 4.0 technologies include Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, and Cloud Computing. This project is designed to help meet the rising need for highly skilled workers who are ready for employment in Mechatronics and Industry 4.0. The College?s South Georgia service area is home to more than 150 manufacturing companies.  Current industry partners include Polar Beverages, Kelly Manufacturing Company, Campbell Scientific, NextEra Energy, Dillard?s Distribution, Letica Corporation, BASF, and Innotek. To operate and maintain modern manufacturing facilities, these companies need technicians who have Industry 4.0 skills. Coupled with this growing demand for Industry 4.0-competent technicians, there is a shortage of faculty who can teach Industry 4.0 concepts and skills. To meet the dual need for educators and workers, this project plans to: 1) build on an existing mechatronics program to develop a new Mechatronics ? Industry 4.0 degree that can produce workforce-ready technicians; 2) develop educational pathways from local high school mechatronics programs into the new Mechatronics ? Industry 4.0 program; 3) support the teaching and learning of workplace Industry 4.0 competencies; and 4) increase program enrollment, especially of underrepresented student populations including female and Latinx students. A comprehensive evaluation will determine the impact of the project as well as make recommendations for modifications.<br/><br/>This project intends to develop a pipeline of students from a high-school advanced manufacturing program into a college-level Mechatronics program that includes Industry 4.0 training. Using industry experts as co-teachers, professional development activities will provide college faculty with the necessary training and certifications needed to provide high quality education in Industry 4.0 concepts and skills. The project will develop blended-learning resources (i.e. in person and online) and generate insights into how a blended environment affects student learning. Anticipated outcomes of the project are an advanced mechatronics degree with an Industry 4.0 focus and articulated pathways in automated manufacturing from high schools to community and technical colleges. Anticipated benefits to industry partners include: 1) a steady stream of highly skilled, work-ready advanced manufacturing technicians; 2) a curriculum more reflective of industry needs; and 3) an opportunity to shape the educational future of students interested in advanced manufacturing as a career path. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
