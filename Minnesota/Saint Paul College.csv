Industry partners support development of curriculum, provide internship placements and have access to high-tech caollege facilities. SPC houses an instrumentation lab including a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR), and  class 1000 clean room. The project increases the number of highly trained technicians to support workforce demand and connects local businesses to high-tech facilities of the college. SPC demonstrates success through an established and growing for-credit stackable Science Instrumentation Technician program with at least 24 students enrolled each semester. The program offers for-credit problem-based internships with mentor guidance from industry professionals and at least five industry partners are using the high-tech instrumentation center and class 1000 clean room facilities on a regular basis. Intellectual merit is provided through collaboration of the principal investigator and industry partners led by a Technical Program Advisory Committee. The broader impact is realized as SPC produces graduates that meet the needs of the workforce in chemical technology and science instrumentation fields. SPC achieves regional impact as a high-tech provider of working instrumentation laboratory equipment and facilities. This work furthers the goal of the Minnesota Legislature to create a corridor of high-tech industry between the metropolitan areas of Minneapolis and Saint Paul."

The project will expand and enhance the College's Science Technician Associate of Science (AS) degree program.  To increase the placement of Science Technician AS graduates directly into the workforce, the project will: infuse science technician skills into required courses; develop a job and internship center; formalize partnerships to increase access to internship experiences; and develop an industry-relevant capstone research experience for all Science Technician AS students.  The project intends to broaden participation in the science technician AS program by adding a biology track and using targeted outreach and dissemination.  As a result, this project has the potential to broaden participation in STEM careers.<br/><br/>A major goal of the project is to include capstone projects for all students in the Science Technician AS program.  To this end, it has already established agreements from at least six academic or industry partners to provide internships for up to 14 students per semester.  The internships include traditional off-campus opportunities as well as on-campus opportunities in which scientific equipment at St. Paul College will be used for research and development needs of industry partners.  The project includes a mixed-methods evaluation plan that will be conducted by external experts. Quantitative indicators will include data from ongoing national surveys in which the College currently participates, disaggregated program and course enrollment and completion counts, and the results from surveys designed specifically for the evaluation of this project.  Qualitative data will be collected through semi-structured interviews with mentors at industry partner firms and faculty members, and through focus groups with current and former students. Students participating in the Science Technician Program will also compile research portfolios that can be assessed for program improvement purposes as well as to evaluate individual student progress.  Project results will be disseminated at conferences and in peer-reviewed journals, contributing to understanding the impact of project-based education and authentic assessment.  It is expected that this project will improve the success of students in the science technician program and strengthen connections between the College and businesses and industries in the greater Minneapolis-St. Paul area.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
