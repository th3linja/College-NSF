In response, South Central College (SCC) is creating a distance learning education program (iMEC) that builds on its existing Mechatronics Engineering Technology (MET) face-to-face program.  The MET program at SCC is a direct result of strong partnerships with regional industry members, which provide industrial expertise and resources to support this project.  To achieve this, the objectives are to 1) develop and implement the online remote access degree program, 2) create a regional system with educational and industry partners and through outreach, and 3) build the institutional capacity of SCC's MET program.  <br/><br/>This project utilizes online and simulation tools and remote access methods to adapt its existing MET lectures and laboratories to students across the state of Minnesota.  Through the remote access of laboratory systems distance learning students develop troubleshooting skills that are necessary for mechatronics engineering technicians. The iMEC program is leveraging the state-of-the-art mechatronics resources at SCC to provide access to broad groups of students.  The iMEC program is integrating best practices for both distance and face-to-face learning from partners at Moultrie Technical College and the Florida Advanced Technological Education Center (FLATE).  The project evaluation includes a comparison of the student success and student perception between the face-to-face and distance learners and an evaluation process to improve the iMEC program.  <br/><br/>The iMEC program provides advanced manufacturing distance education as well as educational and career pathways into MET for traditional and non-traditional students and broadens the participation of students from underrepresented groups, including women, minorities, and veterans, and geographically dispersed students.  The innovative methods for distance learning used in the iMEC program can be adapted by other engineering and technology programs and addresses the demands of future engineering education.  The iMEC program serves as an education model that integrates continuous quality improvement and best practices and adapts curricula and instructional delivery models through innovative methods to bring distance education to students."

Various state, county and city government employees as well as numerous independent consulting engineers increasingly use GIS as a tool for planning, design, data management, and utility location. The GIS Certificate Program is providing current CET students with GIS skills that they are using in conjunction with their CET degree upon entering the workforce. The project is also providing regional CET employees with additional learning opportunities that are expanding and enhancing their existing GIS skills. The GIS Certificate Program design is being guided by an advisory board composed of local industry employers, many of whom are also participating in the new Practicum course developed through this project, and the ATE GeoTech Center. The resultant hands-on Certificate Program is providing students with opportunities to apply their GIS skills to various civil engineering applications, including infrastructure management (storm, sanitary, water), corridor studies, environmental studies, traffic analysis, and land management activities. Students enrolled in newly developed courses of the Certificate Program are expected to demonstrate proficiency with GIS hardware and software, and also demonstrate spatial data communication, spatial analysis, and data delivery skills. Student learning is being assessed through the use of rubrics, testing and performance evaluations, and peer review. Formative evaluation is guiding ongoing improvements in the program. The project is also developing articulation agreements with regional universities that are allowing CET students who earn the GIS certificate to continue their studies towards 4-year GIS degrees. In addition, a GIS training camp is providing training on the use of GIS to faculty and staff from CET, agriculture, marketing, and geography who have demonstrated interest towards incorporating GIS into their existing courses and curricula. Finally, the project is providing GIS-based summer camps for K-12 students in order to enhance their interest in pursuing STEM careers."
