The goals of the project are to increase the number of future teachers at Normandale Community College who choose a mathematics or science specialty, to improve the science, technology and mathematics preparation of all students in the elementary education program (K-8 licensure), and to attract talented and diverse students into the teaching field by recruiting from underrepresented or nontraditional populations.  The EdTraC office is establishing a database to identify and track elementary education students on campus and begin gathering data, developing a process for identifying students for core-course and math-science specialty cohorts, developing an internal website for project personnel, instructors, and pre-service teachers, and working with two partner high schools to create and pilot a process for recruitment events and ambassador visits. The PI team continues to build on its 2 + 2 partnership with Minnesota State University (MSU), Mankato, through which students complete the prerequisites for the MSU Mankato elementary education program and may choose to complete the entire four-year program at the Normandale Community College campus.  They are also developing and piloting three new courses to meet the needs of future teachers.  These include a physics course that satisfies general education requirements and provides content appropriate for elementary teachers, a Technology for Math course to introduce pre-service teachers to technology that can be integrated into mathematics, and a Technology for Teachers course to teach pre-service educators methods for integrating technology into the K-8 classroom. <br/>"

Examples of engineered systems that depend on vacuum technology include the touchscreens on phones, coatings on medical devices, and water purification components.  Although a significant and ""enabling"" technology in its applications, it is also often hidden. Vacuum systems, and the technicians who maintain them, remain virtually unknown outside of the industry. As the existing workforce ages and the number of businesses relying on vacuum technology increases, our nation faces a critical shortage of technicians to maintain the complex vacuum systems that we are all dependent on. This project will respond to this challenge by developing a ""focused track"" credential to educate vacuum technicians to meet workforce needs.  This Vacuum Technology Certificate will be offered by Normandale Community College in Bloomington, Minnesota, an accredited institution that is part of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system. The Vacuum Technology Certificate can be completed in one year and will serve the following audiences: (a) entry-level workers already in the field who want to advance their careers, (b) workers in related industries (automotive, metallurgy) who need to retrain, (c) veterans with related experience moving into a new career, and (d) high school students who seek work experience prior to continuing their education.  <br/><br/>To ensure that the Vacuum Technology Certificate is broadly accessible, the project team will use a blend of distance learning technologies and disseminate the program widely. Key activities of the project include: (a) curricular development for both face-to-face and online course delivery, (b) hands-on laboratory development, (c) professional development for educators, and (d) dissemination. More specifically, three new courses will be developed: (1) an e-learning course for anyone to explore basic vacuum technology concepts and careers, (2) an online course for current students to earn credit while learning chemistry, math, and physics concepts used every day by technicians, and (3) an advanced course in vacuum and thin film technology for the certificate program.  The three-course core curriculum will be offered on campus and via telepresence using high speed audiovisual connection linking students and instructors in real time.  The use of trainer systems will also enable students to gain hands-on practice with the processes and equipment used on job sites.  Lastly, with strong dissemination, a network of instructors with industry experience will be established and be supported to become teachers to the next generation of vacuum technicians."
