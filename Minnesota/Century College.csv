The project is educating law enforcement personnel in investigative sciences and technologies, and establishing a regional source for curriculum planning, course development and delivery, faculty training, and information dissemination. Curriculum supporting a new two-year degree (Associate in Science in Investigative Sciences), new certifications, new continuing education modules, as well as articulation agreements with four-year institutions are being developed. The curriculum for the new degree will focus on the following seven courses: Crime and Incident Mapping, Computer Forensics, Forensic Science, Homeland Defense, Visual Forensic Technologies, Investigative Technologies, and the Science of Hazardous Materials. Close collaboration with stakeholders, including the Peace Officers Standards & Training (POST) board ensures new materials remain relevant and in compliance with new and existing licensing requirements."

Curriculum materials being developed incorporate topics in technology-intensive subjects in investigations, interoperability, and intelligence.  They include the preparation of three online courses: Forensic Psychology I, Introduction to Intelligence, and Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design.  The two certifications being prepared are ""Crime Mapping and Analysis"" and ""Intelligence Analysis"".<br/><br/>This project serves diverse and underserved segments of the population, particularly in rural areas and in tribal communities and regions in Minnesota and North and South Dakota."
