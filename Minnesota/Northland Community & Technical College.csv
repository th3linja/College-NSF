This rapidly advancing technology requires a collaborative model between education, government, and industry stakeholders to cultivate the necessary advances in knowledge and technician education. The goal of this project at Northland Community and Technical College in Minnesota is to advance technician education by forming new educational pathways and partnerships, leading to a highly skilled GIT and UAS workforce. The program development will parallel significant changes resulting from industry integration of GIT and UAS technology; develop a technician workforce prepared to utilize UAS technology in a safe, efficient and responsible manner for numerous industries; incorporate input from faculty and industry and government stakeholders in shaping the evolution of technician education enhanced by GIT and UAS technology; and expand educational resources and best practices for GIT and UAS technology. This project builds on a small ATE project (1501629) that was designed to bridge the gap between new and emerging aviation technology and technician education in the area of UAS technology. A comprehensive evaluation will determine the impact of the project as well as make recommendations for modifications so that it can have maximum impact. <br/><br/>Northland has the only accredited UAS maintenance program in the country and has helped define nationally recognized credentials in partnership with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and SpaceTEC. It launched the first two-year AAS degree program in the country in Geospatial Intelligence Analysis to respond to the growing need for technicians educated in this high demand career field and has recently created a small UAS Field Service Technician Program to develop the knowledge base in technical proficiencies required as small UAS are integrated into the national airspace system (NAS). Building on these activities and those of its partners, the project will create innovative, industry driven curriculum to integrate GIT and UAS technology into technician education; develop collaborative partnerships with universities, public sector, and industry stakeholders to align educational pathways for dynamically changing careers resulting from GIT and UAS technology; and advance faculty knowledge and resources for GIT and UAS technology. The key objectives for this project are to: (a) leverage existing NSF ATE resources to validate workforce assessments and enhance GIT and UAS curriculum modeling for broad disciplines such as agriculture, public safety and infrastructure inspection.; (b) establish collaborative educational pathways by integrating new and existing curriculum across Minnesota State through dual credit enrollment and 2+2 articulation; and (c) expand GIT and UAS professional development opportunities and educational resources throughout higher education including development of curriculum and materials, access to laboratory resources, and workshops for college faculty, high school teachers, and students."

This project at Northland Community and Technical College (NCTC) will bridge the gap between new and emerging aviation technology and technician education in the area of UAS and will increase career opportunities through the development of a pipeline for highly skilled workers to meet industry demands. A study released in 2013 by the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) forecast the economic impact of the integration of UAS into the NAS to total more than $13.6 billion in the first three years of integration and to grow sustainably for the foreseeable future, cumulating to more than $82.1 billion between 2015 and 2025. AUVSI also stated the integration into the NAS will create more than 70,000 new jobs in the first 3 years. By 2025, total job creation is estimated at 103,776 jobs. The project will initiate, facilitate, and maintain partnerships with industry leaders, 7-14 schools and higher education institutions to confirm workforce competencies and curriculum. It will increase educational opportunities to advance aviation technologies and the impacts regionally and nationally, helping to position the U.S. as a leader in the global UAS market. By collaborating with key stakeholders at the UAS test sites, the project will create models for technician education in UAS maintenance and meet technical employment needs of UAS and other high-growth industries. With the rapid growth in these new technologies there is a great opportunity to influence standardized education for this science, technology, engineering, and technology (STEM) discipline.<br/><br/>To address current skill gaps and educational opportunities, the project will create innovative, industry driven curriculum for UAS and related disciplines, industry recognized stackable credentials, and technician career pathways. It will provide professional development for faculty members to stay current in emerging technologies and learn new teaching methods that will allow them to incorporate these materials into UAS programs as well as in existing STEM courses. It will promote and provide educational opportunities to underrepresented populations and rural areas by leveraging tele-presence technology to expand geographical reach and serve non-traditional students. Project personnel will disseminate instructional materials, research information, and papers for use by educational and industry partners. Workshops and summer camps will promote awareness to secondary and post-secondary educators and students interested in STEM. A comprehensive evaluation will identify best practices in the education of UAS technicians to fill this emerging national need."

Autonomous technologies have the potential to revolutionize the way people across the globe live, work, travel, and learn. They also have critical implications for the national economy, as well as national safety and security.  The National Center for Autonomous Technologies will focus on three areas of autonomous technology: unmanned aircraft systems, connected automated vehicles, and unmanned underwater vehicles. These autonomous vehicles  will have tremendous impact on the quality of human life across the nation, from rural to urban communities, as well on understanding of agriculture, the biosphere, and sustaining life in the oceans. Successful deployment of autonomous vehicles requires highly skilled, agile technicians who can support vehicle design, monitoring, control, use, and repair. The mission of the National Center for Autonomous Technologies will be to coordinate and lead efforts to educate the skilled technical workforce in autonomous technologies. The Center aims to achieve its mission through a concerted national effort that will develop and disseminate educational resources to meet current and future workforce demands and broadly engage stakeholders from industry, government, and related ATE projects and centers. <br/><br/>The Center aims to improve student learning and technician education by conducting research and analysis to design quality curricula and content that meets the evolving demands of autonomous technologies in unmanned aircraft systems, connected automated vehicles, and unmanned underwater vehicles. The Center also aims to support recruitment and success of rural and underrepresented students in careers related to autonomous technologies, while developing replicable models that increase access to these careers for all students. This work will build upon existing collaborations with Tribal Serving Colleges and with high schools throughout the Northern Plains region.  The Center's specific objectives include to: 1) design, develop, coordinate, and implement specialized and collaborative autonomous technology workshops for educators and industry; 2) expand engagement in STEM and autonomous technologies by increasing the quality and diversity of the STEM workforce; 3) employ service learning activities that support community engagement and increase the visibility and utility of careers in autonomous technologies; and 4) establish an education resource hub for autonomous technologies with a focus on outreach and expanded partnerships. The National Center for Autonomous Technologies aims to achieve its mission through partnerships with ATE Centers (e.g., CAAT; CA2VES; GeoTech; MATE; and SpaceTEC), ATE projects, industry, and government. By supporting collaborations among these stakeholders, the Center expects to develop and disseminate the content and tools needed to educate technicians for careers in autonomous technologies. This project is funded by the NSF Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
