Fond du Lac Tribal and Community College (FLTCC) has excellent existing computing facilities for a community college and is able to leverage their facilities and projects jointly with the University of  Minnesota. The connection will be used to enable ongoing collaborations with the forestry institute and the University of  Minnesota."

Sediment cores are being collected from six wild rice lakes that are within the boundaries of the reservation to determine the history of the lakes both in recent times and prior to European settlement. The goal of the research is to understand the wild rice environment (e.g., water level, nutrients, competing plant species) and thus support improved strength of wild rice production. In conjunction with the research on these lake cores, the local Chippewa community is participating in and learning about the project through a monthly series of public forums, through undergraduate and high-school student research projects, through science enrichment activities for K-12 students, and through the participation of teachers from local schools, who are helping with the lake-coring research. Combined, these efforts are working to broaden participation of Native American students in geoscience and environmental science careers.<br/><br/>The project is a collaboration between scientists and educators at the Fond du Lac Tribal and Community College, the University of Minnesota's LacCore (National Lacustrine Core Facility), and FDL reservation resource management scientific staff. Additional collaborators include the Science Museum of Minnesota, faculty and staff from the gidakiimanaaniwigamig (Our Earth Lodge) Native American Youth Science Enrichment Program, the giiwed'anang (North Star) Undergraduate AISES Alliance, and programs of the National Center for Earth-surface Dynamics, the Center for Compact and Efficient Fluid Power, and the Northstar STEM alliance. <br/><br/>Through the manoomin project, 25 Native American undergraduate and high school students complete research projects related to manoomin research goals each year. Another 50 K-12 students participate in monthly science clubs, where they interact with scientists from the university and the reservation, while learning about this precious community resource. Many of these undergraduate and K-12 students participate in a pre-REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) program, where they spend a week in the summer conducting research, with the goal that they will pursue a research internship in the next year. Others participate in a week-long transitions program. This summer program uses the ""Expanding the Circle: Respecting the Past; Preparing for the Future"" curriculum developed at the University of Minnesota, Institute on Community Integration. This transition curriculum, developed in 2002, includes specific activities to prepare American Indians for the transition from high school to college. <br/><br/>In addition, by following the Circle of Learning philosophy of the gidakiimanaaniwigamig program, manoomin is a testing ground for a holistic teaching and learning methodology that uses seven key elements of learning to increase science, technology, engineering and mathematics learning in participants. Activities are designed to enhance seven elemental abilities: quantitative, conceptual, spatial, relational, metacognitive, verbal, and mechanical using an approach designed to promote growth in the whole individual."

This planning effort involved a large number of college and community<br/>stakeholder groups and provided both the underlying concepts for this proposal as well as the<br/>outline for specific curriculum programs and hardware/software infrastructure needs.<br/>The project proposed has several interrelated elements. High performance computing assets,<br/>including Internet2 hookup, cluster installation, and visualization panels, are put into place to<br/>support both curriculum and research agendas. The research agenda is centered in ongoing<br/>research efforts at the college in environmental science, soil mapping, computational science,<br/>and information technology (IT). The research effort is designed to provide students with<br/>experience in research, experience with the collaborative research environment, and<br/>experimential activities related to what they are studying. The grant also proposes to build a<br/>partnership with the University of Minnesota's Laboratory for Computational Science and<br/>Engineering, both to provide help with constructing the high performance infrastructure, as<br/>well as a research agenda that will involve students in computational science, physics, and<br/>other SMET-related curriculum areas.  Other collaborative efforts will be implemented with<br/>current partners involved in FDLTCC research projects.<br/><br/>At the proposed project's heart are curriculum development and implementation activities<br/>designed to not only build on the enhanced research projects, but to also initiate new SMET<br/>degrees.  Research with FDLTCC's target student population has indicated that these degrees<br/>and a one-year certificate program will increase the number of Native American students<br/>majoring in SMET-related programs.  These degrees are all designed to launch a new<br/>curriculum track design, which provides a core of Information Technology courses that<br/>students can use to build either baccalaureate or associate degrees in a number of different<br/>disciplines.<br/><br/>The degrees and certificate initiated through the project will include: A GIS/GPS certificate<br/>which can be earned in conjunction with the environmental science, computer science, and<br/>law enforcement associate degrees; a baccalaureate in computer science with the IT core; an<br/>associate degree in E-Crime and Computer Security that can be earned with the IT core, the<br/>GIS/GPS certificate, and the college's current Minnesota Transfer or Law Enforcement<br/>associate degrees in order to complete the requirements for a baccalaureate.  The new IT core<br/>will also be available to baccalaureate students in Elementary Education at FDLTCC.  By the<br/>end of the grant, enrollment in these curriculum areas will support continuation of each<br/>program based on the timetable described in the grant.<br/><br/>The last two elements of the grant include the plan to develop an associate degree online for<br/>students located at FDLTCC's Augsburg Offsite program that serves the Native American<br/>community in St. Paul/Minneapolis. This effort will also use the high performance<br/>computing resources built through the project.  SMET related faculty and staff development<br/>activities are also included designed to increase IT sophistication at FDLTCC as well as to<br/>increase the number of MS and Ph.D.-qualified faculty in SMET-related areas."

They shall also study traditional Native American view of the world - not to abandon standard Western scientific methods, but to examine fresh approaches to problem solving.  FDLTCC will create a lower division computer science program designed specifically to support and encourage American Indian students through successful transfer to a four year institution to complete their upper division CISE studies.  Formal mentoring and curriculum designed to encourage performance in a cooperative manner will characterize the tribal college program.    This model, cultivating interest in CISE work among American Indian youth, supporting the bridge from K-12 schools to the tribal college, strongly supporting American Indian students in lower division CISE studies, and supporting students through transfer to high quality four year computer science programs, is designed to be attractive and applicable to tribal K-12 schools and colleges governed by sovereign tribal nations which are the key education providers for American Indian youth living on or near tribal lands.  ***"
