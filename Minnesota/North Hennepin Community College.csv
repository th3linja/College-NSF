Using an older, manually operated Scanning Electron Microscope(SEM), a pilot project with SEM applications for lower-division college students has demonstrated that SEM lab experiences generate a greater interest in and understanding of science subjects. A fully automated, user friendly SEM will permit the following changes to be made in the Biology Department: (1) A new course focusing on techniques in structual biology that includes a student research componen will be added; (2) students studying cell and molecular biology will have enhanced hands-on lab experience in the examination of cellular and tissue structure; (3) all students in introductory biology will have an opportunity for firsthand operation of a SEM -The experience itself and the micrographs produced will supplement other laboratory and lecture materials used for the study of intricate structures; and (4) laboratory demonstrations for visiting secondary school students and opportunities for research projects by visiting college and secondary school educators will increase."

GARNET institutions represent a cross-section of the higher education spectrum and include the University of Akron, University of Colorado-Boulder, California State University-Chico, North Hennepin Community College, Macalester College, and the University of North Dakota. GARNET's goals are: 1) To use two instruments, the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) and the Science Value Inventory (SVI), to investigate how aspects of the affective domain, in particular student motivation and values, vary for students in introductory physical geology; and 2) Identify if and how those aspects vary with instructor and specific aspects of the learning environments. The key hypotheses are that: 1) The affective domain is a major control on student learning; and, 2) How we teach can significantly change students' affective behavior. The outcome of this research will be pedagogical resources and strategies that guide the development of more effective introductory geoscience classes. The GARNET project results on the influence of the affective domain on geoscience learning and the pedagogical best practices identified begin to fill a largely underappreciated, little studied, yet highly significant gap in our understanding of student learning of science. The project focuses on a way to explore student learning in the geosciences that to date, has received almost no consistent attention at the college level, and no broad analysis within a single discipline. GARNET builds on an existing knowledge base in educational psychology that has been applied in a limited way to some college science classes but there is a paucity of information on the affective domain in introductory geoscience courses that hinders the potential of instructors to engage students and enhance science learning processes. The GARNET assessment plan measures outcomes that provide a foundation for subsequent research and the collaborative nature of this project has the potential to result in the creation of small teams of investigators exploring specific aspects of the affective domain. Results of the evaluation program will reveal which pedagogical strategies are most effective in creating learning environments characterized by more motivated students, with good attitudes about learning geoscience, and greater confidence in their ability to learn class material."

The computational approaches that Profs. Siepmann, Rafferty and their students are developing will be combined with experimental data measured by Dr. Mark Schure and collaborators at Dow Chemical to better understand the process taking place in these experimental systems.  The ultimate goal of these kinds of experiments is to improve these processes for science and engineering applications.   <br/> <br/>The ability to cleanly and efficiently separate complex chemical mixtures into their separate components is of critical importance to a number of important industries, including the production of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, etc.  The separation and purification steps in the production of these commodities is also one that can use significant quantities of materials and produce significant amount of waste. By developing better methods for separations, Siepmann, Rafferty and others hope to improve the selectivity and efficiency of these important processes.  The graduate and undergraduate students working on this project will gain useful experience in academic and industrial settings, which will help prepare them well for a wide variety of careers in science and technology.  This project will also involve the participation of high school and community college students in this research, which will help to excite and engage the next generation of scientists."
