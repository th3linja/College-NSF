This program helps create a more diverse, better-prepared STEM professional community by enabling not only eligible underrepresented, underserved students to succeed in science and technology, but also by enabling other high achieving students to further their education.<br/><br/>Previous NSF awards at MCTC have a strong history of student success; 89% of students participating in the S-STEM program graduate, transfer to a baccalaureate program, or are on track for graduation or transfer.  This new support is enabling the institution to strengthen and improve its efforts by stepping up recruiting, serving more students, creating alumni support group and incorporating new campus resources.  Improved recruiting strategies include leveraging digital resources, student clubs, and campus events concurrently to increase the pool of qualified applicants.  New campus resources to be incorporated include integrated advising, tutors linked to courses, new student interest groups in STEM, and the MCTC Undergraduate Research Initiative.<br/><br/>The MCTC S-STEM project is creating a more diverse, better-prepared STEM professional community by enabling academically talented, financially needy students to succeed in science and technology.  The creative and successful design of this project is based on combining scholarship monies with peer cohort and faculty mentoring support. The commitment of accomplished faculty from STEM disciplines, relevant administrators, financial aid staff, and student support staff, as well as top-notch facilities, support services, long-standing connections with baccalaureate institutions, and outstanding contacts in the local STEM industry make the program sustainable. Furthermore, the MCTC S-STEM Scholars program is also serving first-generation students, low-income students, students of color, and other high achieving students. In so doing, it is helping to prepare a diverse, well-qualified workforce that can strengthen both the regional and global economy. The results of MCTC S-STEM are reported via the MCTC website and faculty presentations at local and national conferences.  The program is also leaving a lasting legacy by creating a network of program alumni to support STEM students, by increasing the diversity of students earning degrees in STEM fields, and by enhancing support services that benefit future generations of STEM students."

The scholarship program is enabling students, who otherwise could not, to attend college full-time. With a college enrollment of the traditionally underrepresented minority groups reaching 46%, a significant number of whom are Native Americans, the program is successfully bringing members of these groups into STEM careers.  A goal of the project is that 85% of the CSEMS scholars earn an Associate's degree within two years.  A variety of student support services are being provided including academic and career planning, experiential learning opportunities, counseling, financial aid advice and student life programs.  Local business and industry are providing summer internships for the students."

The project aspires to have at least eighty-five percent of the scholars complete a two-year degree and either transfer to a baccalaureate program, or enter the workforce in two years. The intellectual merit of the project builds on a variety of elements such as the creation of a supportive cohort environment, assignment of a faculty mentor from each student's academic discipline, and receipt of ongoing support including academic and career advice, counseling, and work experience opportunities, along with peer interaction. The program is exercising broader impact by enabling more members of at-risk communities to become professionals in science, technology and mathematics fields, diversifying the workforce and providing role models for other under-represented individuals to pursue similar goals."

These regulations dictate curriculum and testing procedures for schools that prepare Airframe (aircraft structure) and Powerplant (engines) Technicians. Advancements in aircraft systems, structures and engines without regulatory updates and the current shortage of technicians, demand aggressive measures to improve and expand the current system of preparing aircraft technicians.<br/><br/>This project is serving as a catalyst for systemic change in the preparation of aircraft technicians by bringing together many organizations that have the capacity to influence change on a national basis. As a major step to involve partners, the project is organizing a national conference whose focus is to develop a plan for aircraft technician reform, addressing the basic mathematics and science requirements as well as the specific skills and curriculum for avionics, airframe, and other related aviation specialties. In particular, the topics to be considered include certification standards and procedures, curricula including both core and technical courses, internship programs, access to instructional technology, student recruitment, and faculty development.<br/><br/>A second goal of this project is the development and testing of three courses -- electrical connectors, communication, and navigation. The initial testing of these courses is with incumbent technicians. After the initial trouble shooting, the courses are being introduced as credit courses setting the foundation for new aircraft electronics certification programs.<br/><br/><br/>"

However, as aircraft have become increasingly electronics driven, a career path has evolved for technicians specializing in troubleshooting, maintenance and repair of aircraft electrical and integrated flight systems. National standards, curricula and regulatory oversight presently do not exist for Avionics Technicians.  While the FAA recognizes this gap, it has not filled it.  Industry, labor and education have come together, with participation and support from the FAA, to fill this void in an effort to meet the workforce development needs of aircraft manufacturers, component manufacturers, airlines, and repair stations throughout the United States. <br/> <br/><br/>"
