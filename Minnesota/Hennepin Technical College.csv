During                      its first two years, PriMath II will work with school                           systems to develop individual, long-range improvement plans.                    Ten participating teams will each include up to four (K-4)                      classroom teachers or specialists selected from Pri-Math I                      participants + a district-level administrative person.                          Those teams will in-turn select supporting teams to enroll                      in the second two years.  Thus 56 lead teachers and 33                          administratives will be involved directly to reach 1668                         teachers indirectly by peer teaching.  Project activities                       will occur in 4 settings during each of the 4 years: 4-week                     summer institutes, 8 school-year seminars, 4 school-year                        visits by the PD to participant classrooms, and among                           participants within their schools coaching peers plus                           conducting inservice to articulate/implement system-wide                        plans.  Mathematics content and pedagogy is integrated                          throughout, with summer mathematics content courses being                       Geometry/Spatial Sense, Functions & Proportionality, Number                     Systems & Number Sense, and Data Analysis."

Teachers from a collaborative of 13 school districts will serve                 as the target audience. The project structure includes a summer                 institute for teacher teams, a series of seminars during the                    academic year, staff visits to participant classrooms, visits                   among participants to each other's classrooms, and in-service                   offerings by participants. Principals, mathematics curriculum                   specialists, and gifted education curriculum specialists will                   be involved. The mathematical content focus is in the area of                   geometry, with emphasis on patterns and visualization. Teachers                 will select and adapt existing materials for use with gifted                    primary students.                                                                                                                                               Cost sharing is provided in the amount of 1.14% of the NSF                      award."
