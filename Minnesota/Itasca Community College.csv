This project at Itasca Community College in Minnesota is timely as the current workforce in the region is aging, and it has become recognized by regional industries that a workforce pipeline is needed to maintain current operations and facilitate future growth.  It is designed to develop an Associate in Applied Science (AAS) program in Process Operations that will capitalize on the need these industries have for highly-qualified and motivated employees. The program is a shift from the current industry specific technical programs of the region to a program that is focused on developing graduates who are prepared to be 21st century workers for these industries. This will increase the regional economic vitality and help the college remain a model of progressive instruction. Partners include industries such as Minnesota Power, Lonza, Blandin Paper Company, Marvin Windows and Doors, and American Sugar as well as the high schools in the vicinity of the college. The overall curriculum will be industry driven through its development and will remain responsive to the industrial fluctuations in the region by maintaining and utilizing strong industry ties. The college will become a member of the North American Process Technology Alliance (NAPTA) that can provide curriculum and access to model programs as well as an avenue for project dissemination.<br/><br/>This Associate in Applied Science (AAS) program in process operations will encompass a broad scope of industrial plant operations to educate and motivate future industrial technicians by utilizing a structured learning community to deliver a condensed one-and-a-half year curriculum. To maximize the chance for success, students will be required to have prerequisite courses in industrial safety, welding, machining, fabrication, computing, and mathematics. To provide students multiple pathways, students may enter the program from one of four pathways (a summer boot camp, high school credits developed for this project, industrial work experience, or relevant college courses and experiences.)  It will develop ties to local school districts through ""College-In-The-Schools"" curriculum development and take advantage of industry partners through site visits, capstone projects, and adjunct industry-based instructors. The areas of student development and assessment will be technical knowledge (what students know), professionalism (who students are), and process awareness (what students can do). The nationally recognized pre-engineering program at the college will serve as a model for this new AAS Process Operations program. Model tenents will be utilization of Project Based Learning (PBL), industry tours, industry professionals serving as instructors or guest speakers, student learning communities, and student ownership of and pride in the program. The two established and growing Industrial Technologies programs in Power Generation and Pulp and Paper at the college have laid the groundwork for this more broadly applicable AAS Process Operations program in terms of infrastructure, curriculum, and industry ties. A comprehensive evaluation process will be used to assess and improve this AAS in Process Operations program during its formation and execution."

This service area is also under-educated in terms of the number of households holding one or more college degrees when compared to the rest of Minnesota. Over 70% of entering Freshmen at the college qualify for PELL grant financial aid, and over 80% of entering Freshmen hold jobs of 20-30 hours per week in order to pay for college and living expenses. Also in the service area is a Native American population virtually unserved by any educational agency that stresses technology or engineering careers. Although recruiting and summer initiatives already make sustained contact with these groups of students, to a student from a first generation college home, to a female student with little peer support for engineering, or to an Anishanabe student with little or no family contact with engineering, these efforts have not proven sufficient to enable degree completion. Through this project NSF funding is providing an escalating system of financial support for both entering and second year students in order to bring the career of engineering to the student groups mentioned above.  We expect to demonstrate that scholarships aimed at capable students among these groups can serve to overcome low peer and family expectations for engineering career access. Based on this experience and a strong educational research and assessment program, we seek to redirect college foundation funds and tribal funds towards continued scholarship support of these groups in engineering.<br/>"

Students spend two years completing calculus, physics, chemistry, statics, dynamics, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, circuits, and other courses. After graduation, students transfer to a university to complete their degree. Since 1992, 75% of the students who started physics graduated from a university with a STEM degree. There has been consistent enrollment growth from 10 students to 196 students over the past 15 years. Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Computer Science, and Engineering Technology majors are included in this community of learners and are eligible for scholarships.  This project is informed by research and demonstrates the impact of Learning Communities and effective recruiting strategies. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The impact of the recruiting and retention projects on a program's ability to attract new STEM students and enable them to persist to degree completion has the potential to be widely adapted. The experience with first generation college students (82% of college population) show they excel with the strategies shown by research to benefit students in underrepresented groups. This project expands recruiting into a metro area with large populations of Hispanic, Somali, and Hmong people. It enhances infrastructure of education at the college by enabling talented students without financial resources to attend. Significant numbers of young people (who would not have otherwise) are becoming STEM educated professionals, empowered to impact society. <br/>"

In IRE, students work with industrial professionals on design projects.  The goal is to produce graduates who possess integrated technical and professional knowledge and competencies. IRE students are upper-division mechanical engineering students most of whom are graduates of Minnesota's community colleges. IRE students do not take classes. All of their learning is done in the context of the industry projects. <br/><br/>The publication of Engineer 2020 in 2004 reiterated the need for a new-look engineering graduate. The IRE model has been developed with guidance from respected leaders in engineering education.  In addition to industry-based PBL, the model includes outcome-based assessment, just-in-time interventions, self-directed learning, and emphasis on reflection.  The emphasis of this project is on the evaluation of how engineering learners develop in the IRE model. The project is assessing the extent to which IRE students are acquiring knowledge and developing competencies recommended in national reports and by ABET (the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology).  This evaluation is using various assessment tools (such as the Self-Directed-Learning-Readiness Scale, the National Survey of Student Engagement, the TIDEE design assessment system, selected concept inventories, and best-practice portfolios) to measure realized outcomes with respect to the goals. The results of this project are bring shared with the widest possible audience <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The primary emphasis of this project is on the development of learning outcomes that have been spelled out in national reports, including The Engineer of 2020 and ABET. This emphasis is in contrast with a heavy emphasis on topical material that characterizes many of the engineering programs throughout the world. Faculty members in the new IRE program invest heavily in developing the abilities of students to assess their development with respect to these outcomes. To support self assessment, faculty members are teaching the IRE students criteria that are assisting their metacognitive thinking. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Successful completion of this project is providing engineering educators with a researched-based understanding of how effectively students learn engineering in project-based learning. The results of this study will make visible the extent to which students in engineering PBL develop cognitively, acquire technical competency, acquire professional competency, and the extent to which their motivation to learn is affected."
