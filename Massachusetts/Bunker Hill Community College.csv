Among the factors contributing to this lack of success are 1) student belief that mathematics is memorization of formulas and replication of procedures and 2) student unfamiliarity with effective study techniques and helpful learning resources. This project is developing materials to address both of these problems. To facilitate conceptual understanding, a collection of mathematics software is being developed for classroom use or individual student use. Each interactive computer illustration focuses on a single topic from developmental arithmetic, measurement, or metric geometry. To address the second problem, the developmental mathematics course will be linked to a one-credit course ""Strategies for Student Success"" whose curriculum includes study strategies specifically related to mathematics learning. In addition to the software tools mentioned above, this project is producing a companion instructors' resource guide and a series of ""Success in Mathematics"" modules.<br/><br/>The materials are being developed, tested, and refined over four semesters. The target audience is developmental mathematics students at two-year institutions. <br/><br/>This project is a collaboration between Bunker Hill Community College and the Massachusetts College of Art with Hu Hohn of the Massachusetts College of Art and Joanne Manville of the Bunker Hill Community College Mathematics Department designing and developing the software."

The successful efforts of the college in developing articulation agreements in the targeted disciplines with regional four-year programs will ensure that scholarship recipients have significant opportunities to pursue a four-year degree. A priority of this project is recruiting students who reflect the diversity of the student body at the college, with a focus on women and students of color, in order to prepare them for baccalaureate degrees and high-demand technical careers in STEM. This program will build on a successful prior S-STEM scholarship grant, making it possible for the college to further study and document the model in order to disseminate data-driven analyses of effective practices to other community colleges and universities. <br/><br/>Rewarding Excellence For Leaders in Engineering, Computer Science, Technology, and Science (REFLECTS) will serve academically talented students with demonstrated financial need through scholarships and other support to assist students in completing associate and baccalaureate degrees in STEM majors. Scholarships will support students for two years of study, one year at the community college and one year at a four-year program of the students' choice. The project will employ best practices by implementing intrusive advising by faculty mentors as well as additional supports to assure that students complete their plan of study. The project will also measure the impacts of intrusive faculty mentoring and other activities/supports with the goal of refining the project design, documenting effective practices, and creating a replicable and scalable model that could be adopted by others. Of particular interest are rates of persistence by scholars and completion of associate and baccalaureate degrees. Additionally, the project will provide a faculty mentor, academic support, leadership opportunities, and support related to securing internships and the transfer process to participating students. The objectives of the project are to (a) award 40 REFLECTS scholarships (10 new students per year) for two semesters to academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who are pursuing an associate degree in one of the targeted STEM programs of study; (b) continue scholarship support for REFLECTS Scholars for two additional semesters after transfer as they pursue their baccalaureate degree; (c) create a cohort of REFLECT scholars which reflects the current demographics of the institution; (d) retain at least 90% of REFLECTS scholars to graduation or transfer from the community college and subsequent graduation from their selected-four year institution; (e) provide faculty mentoring for academic planning assistance to REFLECTS Scholars; (f) provide faculty mentoring for assistance with the transfer process to 100% of program graduates as they prepare to transfer to a four-year institution; (g) continue faculty mentoring for program graduates after transfer to four-year institutions; and (h) study the impact of the faculty mentorship activities as they relate to the success of scholars in securing of internships and transferring to four-year institutions."

The programs uniquely combine the disciplines of Information Technology (IT) and Criminal Justice (CJ) and are tailored to the needs of each institution.<br/><br/>CFATE focuses on achieving three goals. The first is to create computer forensics programs that align with law enforcement, public safety, private industry and homeland security needs to ensure consistent, current and flexible training. CFATE works with local/regional law enforcement agencies and industries to determine the needed skill set. Faculty workshops are being conducted to facilitate integration of CJ and IT into courses and expedite curriculum development on a consortium wide basis. CF experts work with the colleges to ensure that materials are rich in real world content. UMass Boston is developing baccalaureate programs that accept community college graduates and provide them with career pathways. In addition, CFATE is developing stand-alone courses and programs for IT professionals and CJ practitioners. The second goal is to offer regional professional development opportunities for educators to develop expertise needed for teaching these programs. In addition to workshops on CJ and IT integration, extensive workshops on CF and the use of state-of-the-art software are being offered. Curriculum development workshops emphasize learner-centered pedagogy that give students needed skills. CF experts work individually with faculty and mentor them as they deliver CF courses. The third goal is to expand the capacity in the region to attract students from diverse backgrounds to CF programs at each institution and support them in gaining employment in related positions. CFATE is creating recruitment materials such as CDs, brochures, and interactive websites to reach local schools and local and regional community organizations. This is combined with targeted personal outreach to schools and organizations.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project is developing programs in which students learn CF technology, security practices, operating systems and information processing in conjunction with investigative procedures, applicable criminal law, and the nature of the CJ system. These programs integrate IT and CJ throughout and are prototypes of IT education in the context of another discipline. The programs are being developed by ""backward design"" in which the required skill sets (outcomes) are identified first and then the curriculum and assessments are developed. An evaluator assists CFATE in developing assessments of student learning. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: By developing programs at four different institutions, CFATE is creating a model that can be widely exported to other institutions. Presentations, workshops and posted curriculum disseminate the program. The five CFATE institutions serve communities with large diverse populations. CFATE targets community organizations and high schools to recruit students and increase the diversity of the technical workforce."
