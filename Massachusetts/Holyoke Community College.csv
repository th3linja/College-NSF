In order to address regional and national STEM workforce needs, as many as 20 scholars will be exposed to an academic climate meant to inspire them to become engineers, chemists, mathematicians, and physicists.  The scholars will participate in a STEM 101 course, which includes a curriculum is based on Complete College America's model for developing ""meta majors"" to help students choose reasonable academic majors and reduce time to degree completion.  Students will also have the option to attend seminar activities, which will include speakers and field trips to transfer universities and industry partners, college success workshops, and diversity training.  Moreover, continuing scholars will be encouraged to act as ambassadors in college access activities, as well as champions for new scholars.<br/><br/>Research shows that STEM majors must be exposed to a robust learning environment.  Thus, the PI team has created a comprehensive plan for academic support services, mentoring, career counseling, and assistance for community college student transfer to four year schools.  The STEM 101 course will offer students a positive first year STEM learning experience that introduces content, experiential learning, and STEM career exploration.   Additionally, the seminar series will help integrate students into the life of the college.  Formative evaluation will be used to address aspects of the project that need improvement, assess student engagement and support, and review academic challenges through a modified version of the Community College Survey of Student Engagement.  Summative evaluation will consist of an analysis of student attitudes and perceptions (surveys and interviews) regarding the active learning community, activities to improve STEM discipline awareness, and academic progress.  Dissemination of the results of evaluation will be submitted to journals such as the Community College Journal, and the Community College Times, and, in so doing, help to expand the knowledge base regarding the circumstances under which scholarship awards of this type are successful."

The increased availability of data, combined with increased computing power at lower costs, has brought to the desktop tremendous analytical and problem solving capabilities. Yet many organizations are not able to take advantage of these developments because they often lack appropriate staffing to wrestle with complex data science problems. Meanwhile, as students increasingly gravitate toward data science programs, much of their course-based problem solving experience focuses on clean problems with simple data sets. This leaves them unprepared for the reality of the data science applications they will face in professional settings. This project addresses both issues by deploying teams of data science students to assist local organizations, thereby increasing the long-term capacity of the data science workforce.<br/><br/>This is a multifaceted project that will provide immediate impact to local organizations and long-term benefit for students through valuable hands-on data science experience. There are two major components of the proposed project. First, Data Science WAV teams of four specially-trained undergraduate students will be deployed to community-based organizations to Wrangle, Analyze, and Visualize their data. Second, this project will offer summer faculty development workshops designed to help new instructors, especially those at community colleges, teach data science at their institutions. Curricular innovations that bring experiential data science learning into the curriculum will lead to sustained impact at the partnering academic institutions and in the larger Pioneer Valley region. This proposal is diverse across both institutions and student populations. It comprises one major research university (The University of Massachusetts, Amherst), four liberal arts colleges (Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, and Smith), and three local community colleges (Greenfield, Holyoke, and Springfield Technical). The inclusion of two women's colleges (Smith and Mount Holyoke) and two Hispanic-serving institutions (Holyoke and Springfield Technical) will help ensure that a diverse student population is engaged in the project. <br/><br/>NSF's Harnessing the Data Revolution Data Science Corps program focuses on building capacity for harnessing the data revolution at the local, state, national, and international levels to help unleash the power of data in the service of science and society. Projects in this program are being jointly funded by the NSF's Harnessing the Data Revolution Big Idea; the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, Division of Information and Intelligent Systems; the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education; the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Division of Mathematical Sciences; and the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences, Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is designed to provide new college and career pathways through the implementation of a clean energy associate degree and clean energy certificates in solar, wind, and geothermal energy. The project builds on the current Sustainability Studies associate degree options in the Liberal Arts and Sciences Program at the college. The new certificate programs are being developed in response to industry requests for trained technicians in wind and solar energy. Students who complete these certificate programs are being prepared to enter the clean energy job market as installers of wind or solar thermal systems as well as energy efficiency auditors. Those students who select the Sustainability Studies Clean Energy option graduate with an A.S. degree prepared to enter the industry as trained energy technicians. Regional industry partners for the proposed project include the FloDesign Wind Turbine Corporation, Beyond Green Construction, Energía LLC, Alteris Renewables, NorthEast Solar, TerraClime Geothermal, Pioneer Valley PhotoVoltaics, and member businesses of the Western  Massachusetts Green Consortium. Articulation with area technical high schools is being facilitated through the Career Vocational Technical Education Linkages (formerly Tech Prep) program coordinated by the college. Academic collaboration between the college and its higher education partners in western Massachusetts is designed to meet growing student interest in sustainability and clean energy courses and is responsive to a statewide need for technical personnel in occupations related to the installation and monitoring of clean energy systems.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The Multidisciplinary Sustainability Studies options at the college have evolved from NSF/NEH/FIPSE supported curricular restructuring investments in Massachusetts community colleges. This project is allowing the college and its academic and industry partners to create new college and career pathways for the growing clean energy economy of the state. Within the framework of the Sustainability Studies curriculum, students enrolled in the new technical certificate programs (wind, solar, and geothermal) and the A.S. degree in Sustainable Energy are integrating technical skills with liberal arts instruction by selecting a concentration of general education coursework in environmental science, business, communications, or social equity.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Careful 2+2+2 articulation with secondary schools and four-year institutions is ensuring that increased numbers of better prepared students are in the technical education pipeline. In addition, the project is emphasizing the recruitment, retention, and graduation of underrepresented, low-income, and first generation college students who reflect the changing K-12, college, and workforce demographics of the region. Curricula, courses, and certificates developed through the project are being shared across the state through the MassGREEN initiative of the 15 Massachusetts community colleges that was established in 2009 to develop and deliver clean energy workforce training programs and through the educational programming of the Western Massachusetts Green Consortium."

New GIS/GPS technology and software products are ideally suited for the study of environmental science and related disciplines, yet most two- and four-year colleges are ill-prepared to adapt their current curriculum to use this valuable tool. Holyoke Community College (HCC) believes that a strategic investment in this keystone technology will have a long-term payoff in a broad range applications in many disciplines and will result in better prepared transfer and career graduates. This project has two major foci: 1) enhancement of the Environmental Science curriculum through the use of GIS/GPS, including the creation of a new major devoted solely to GIS/GPS; and 2) enrichment of teaching and learning of science in area secondary schools through the use of HCC as a GIS/GPS technology transfer station via collaborative relationships with Salem State College. This project will create a 10 station Pentium GIS/GPS lab. Classroom and laboratory learning at the college and area high schools will be enhanced by hands-on, discovery-based learning, especially important for nontraditional learners, particularly students for whom English is a second language. A formative and summative evaluation process will be used over the two-year life of the project. Modifications will be made based upon feedback from pilot testing of new GIS/GPS classroom and lab modules and ongoing input and evaluation from a project advisory committee comprised of local and national experts from two- and four-year institutions and private industry. Final products developed and experience gained will be shared with other educational institutions through HCC's home page on Internet and published in appropriate GIS journals."
