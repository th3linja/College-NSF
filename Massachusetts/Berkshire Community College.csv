The consortium is developing, field testing, and implementing learning modules with units designed to enhance understanding of specific technologies utilized by selected regional industries and to improve mathematics, science, computer, and problem solving skills. The development model focuses upon environmental/agriculture technology, plastics and paper manufacturing, and computer animation as the targeted industry clusters. <br/><br/>Modules, units, and groups of units can be integrated into the curriculum as part of an educational course of study or used by practitioners in the field for exposure to a range of procedures and technologies providing practical applications of mathematics, science, computer, and engineering concepts.  The modules will be designed to accommodate the needs of diverse audiences by providing learning tracks suited to the specific learning styles, developmental levels, competencies, and skill proficiencies of various target groups.  Through multiple delivery options, each target group will be able to select a particular set of units suitable to its own educational needs and access modules at a track compatible with its learning style and background.  In disseminating the modules to other settings, the Consortium will collaborate with the NSF-funded  Telecommunications project at Springfield Technical Community College."
