This lab is an integral part of the         computer maintenance technology program which grants an Associate in            Science degree.  Students now have the opportunity to become                    knowledgeable about the installation, service, and maintenance of the           hardware and software used in computer networks in this ""hands-on""              laboratory experience.  The Computer Maintenance Technology program of          Quinsigamond Community College continues to provide the expanding               computer industry with students trained on the cutting edge of                  technology.  This award is being matched by an equal amount from the            principal investigator's institution."

To help meet this need, this project will develop a one-year robotics technician certificate program to teach skills sought by regional robotics technician employers. The project will also develop a pathway from existing K-12 robotics outreach programs into robotics technological education. The robotics technician curriculum will be designed in partnership with industry to help students develop technical, communication, and problem-solving skills. Industry involvement will ensure that the robotics technician program meets industry needs. Outreach activities will emphasize recruiting students from underrepresented populations including Latinx students, English language learners, economically under-resourced students, and persons with disabilities. The program design will be shared with other institutions of higher education that are interested in developing robotics technician education. <br/><br/>This project will develop and implement a one-year robotics technician certificate program. It will first convene a Business and Industry Leadership Team to help prioritize the skills desired by local employers. It will then use the Developing a Curriculum process to build the curriculum and identify best practices for delivery. Laboratory upgrades will include a programmable, humanoid robot that will support hands-on pedagogy. Professional development for faculty will include a Project-Based Learning workshop and FANUC certification training. Students will be recruited from existing K-12 robotics community outreach programs that already engage a large population of underrepresented students. Thus, the project is expected to strengthen opportunities for students with demonstrated interest in robotics, including students from underrepresented groups, to enter an in-demand career. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is being achieved by increasing the frequency and effectiveness of advocacy for the technical employment and education conveyed by parents, teachers, and career counselors.  Specific project activities include 1) identifying impediments that limit or prevent career influencers from guiding adult job seekers and students toward the pursuit of technician education programs and advanced manufacturing careers; 2) increasing the frequency and effectiveness of career influencers' efforts to guide adult job seekers and students toward pursuit of technician education programs and advanced manufacturing careers; 3) determining a strategy for institutionalizing effective public communications campaign and outreach strategies; and 4) building a replicable model for conducting grassroots public communications and outreach campaigns.  Mass-TEC is leveraging the experience of existing NSF ATE projects and centers, utilizing a strong conceptual and results foundation for its work.<br/>"
