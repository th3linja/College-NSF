The Advisory Board of the Forest and Wood Products Institute at Mount Wachusett Community College (MWCC) and the Wood Products Manufacturers Association (WPMA), a 650-member organization, concur. This project is developing Technician Certificate, Continuing Education, and Contract Training programs that efficiently provide wood products industry employers with productive and well trained employees. This pilot is resulting in the design and development of a unique Certificate Program for Woodworking Technicians at Mount Wachusett Community College, with the ultimate goal the creation of an Associate Degree program. Both the Certificate and the Associate Degree Programs are being linked to regional high school and vocational school programs, and regional universities and colleges, particularly the Building Materials and Wood Technology Program at the University of Massachusetts. One of the unique components of this program is the creation of a Corps of Craftsmen, which consists primarily of retired persons who, through their vast experience, are bringing hands-on instruction and mentoring capability to this educational effort. The program consists of a combination of in-plant, classroom, and multimedia/distance learning. The program initially targets companies and students primarily located in rural areas of the Northeast, in cooperation with the Wood Products Manufacturers Association, with national dissemination to follow the evaluation of the results of this pilot program. The project also serves as a model for application in other industrial sectors, such as the plastics and metal working industries."
"1304474","Stackable Training for Laboratory Science and Quality Technicians in Biopharmaceutical and Biomedical Manufacturing","DUE","ADVANCED TECH EDUCATION PROG","09/01/2013","06/04/2015","John Henshaw","MA","Mount Wachusett Community College","Continuing grant","Rupa Iyer","08/31/2017","$779,716.00","","j_henshaw@mwcc.mass.edu","444 Green Street","Gardner","MA","014401378","9786326600","EHR","7412","1032, 9178, SMET","$0.00","Working with a team of industry partners, this project is developing four competency-based stackable credentials that lead to a new Associate Degree in Analytical and Quality Technology (AQT) at Mount Wachusett Community College.   The project is preparing diverse, rural community college students for employment in quality-related jobs in biopharmaceutical and biomedical device manufacturing.  Products being developed include curriculum modules, stackable certificates, and a capstone course.   Through short duration programs with contextualized and successively increasing levels of content that ultimately stack into certificate and Associate degree programs, the stackable approach provides flexible technical education entry points to students with varying levels of preparation.<br/> <br/>The AQT curriculum is being established in a modular format and incorporated into credit-bearing courses and is also being prepared for integration into non-credit workforce training courses to meet specific needs of students and incumbent workers. Students who complete non-credit training receive credit when all modules associated with a credit-bearing course are satisfactorily completed. A capstone course is being developed that integrates time spent in class and industry-based experiences. This course reinforces student competencies and enhances job opportunities for graduates through industry internships and exposure to the workplace via industry guest speakers, industry tours, trade shows and professional meetings, and targeted industry research. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This project is establishing an integrated technical education and workforce training program that responds to critical employment demands in a region of the country with an exceptionally high concentration of biopharmaceutical and biomedical device manufacturing. This effort builds on the Ohio Stackable Certificates Initiative and utilizes the modular curriculum delivery process developed therein. The evaluation effort employs the Kirkpatrick four levels model of evaluation to monitor the processes and outcomes of project objectives. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The industry-informed curriculum development is designed to meet the technical workforce demands of regional employers, including the need to advance incumbent worker skills. It will promote diversity in the technical workforce by creating opportunities for diverse, rural students and unemployed workers in need of educational opportunities to reenter the workforce. The curriculum developed for the AQT associate degree program serves as a model for other institutions to adopt and implement. Dissemination activities include writing a technical paper, giving presentations at conferences, providing access of the curriculum to all Massachusett's community colleges, and making all curricular content available online."

The Institute has recently converted the College's all-electric campus to a biomass heating system. This biomass system at the College serves as the focal point for the project. The goal of this project is to establish a biomass technology demonstration site in the Northeastern United States where industry and government decision-makers, students, and educators can learn about renewable biomass energy technologies. A long-term goal of the Institute is to produce replicable undergraduate curriculum for development of skilled workers in emerging renewable biomass energy technologies and policies. Specific activities for this one-year period include: expanding relationships to include new partners in the development of biomass energy; developing support among State and Federal agencies involved in renewable energy technology and policy; and creating an Advisory Board of regional and national stakeholders in the field."

Under this project faculty developed an educational program for woodworking technicians, employing a unique combination of educational videos, classroom and in-plant instruction utilizing a ""Corps of Craftsman."" The latest efforts build on this work to further develop and implement a national model offering distance-learning courses to industry professionals or students in existing woodworking training programs. Through this program, students earn a wood technician certificate which is applied towards an associate degree in wood products technology. MWCC is completing the development of and is offering the full associate degree program for woodworking technicians on a distance-learning basis in conjunction with an ongoing Winrock International apprenticeship program in Arkansas. Once their full program is underway in Arkansas, it will be expanded to at least one other state during the project period. The intent is to eventually use the Arkansas program as a national model. Courses are being offered through a unique combination of distance-learning and classroom instruction. <br/><br/>The ""Corps of Craftsmen,"" consisting of both retired and non-retired personnel, was established as part of the initial NSF project. These craftpersons also assist in some of the hands-on educational instruction of the program. The course materials developed for the education of apprentices in Arkansas are also being used for a project currently underway in Washington, D.C. MWCC faculty are working in Washington, D.C. to train a diverse group of inner-city youths in woodworking, with partial support from their previous NSF grant. Ongoing participation of these youths in the project enhances their opportunities for learning. Another unique component of their program involves the inclusion of an industry trade magazine. Non-credit and for-credit course modules (portions of full courses) are being administered in cooperation with Wood Digest magazine on a national level. A major strength of their project is the involvement of several public and private organizations."
