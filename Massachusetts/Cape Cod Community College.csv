The students are adapting the GSIII to monitor the sensitivities associated with the Cape's sole source aquifer now threatened by the pollution discovered at the Massachusetts Military Reservation, (MMR), a SuperFund site located on Cape Cod.  Cape Cod Community College and two neighboring Massachusetts institutions have developed an education program which includes degree options, certificate programs and internships to prepare students for jobs at the MMR and other Cape locations. The GSIII gives small teams of students a rigorous, hands-on experience in science related to the impact of the Superfund site on the Cape's aquifer.<br/>Science, math and technology concepts have been introduced by examining current issues for which students have some personal context as recommended in the NSF publication, Shaping the Future, New Expectations for Undergraduate Education in Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology. The equipment implemented enhances the laboratory experience for students in three courses at CCCC and complements the instrumentation acquired through a 1997 NSF ILI grant.  The plan to have small teams of students using the GSIII enables them to have frequent experience with active learning and peer group collaboration in the laboratory.  This method has been strongly encouraged by the Massachusetts Department of Education to improve students' communication and cognitive skills. The addition of the Ion Chromatograph (IC) allows upper level students to train on three different pieces of state-of- the-art instrumentation, including the Spec 20 and UV/VIS and compare the results from these different instruments.  The implementation of EPA Method 300 for the IC exposes students to relevant and accepted workplace practices.  Most laboratories on Cape Cod use the IC for groundwater and other analysis.  These powerful hands-on instrumentation experiences stimulate interest among current and prospective students and generate increased enrollment. The program has gained a reputation for state-of-the-art instrumentation training and problem solving techniques.  Assessment of student response and success with these exercises is being carefully measured.  Questionnaires assess how well the students have been prepared.  Advisory committee members review the relevance of the laboratory exercises and teaching techniques from the industry point of view.  Evaluation  activities follow the implementation guidelines described in the publication Executive Guide: Effectively Implementing the Government Performance and Results Act.  Dissemination occurs within the network of Massachusetts community colleges and nationally through the Partners in Environmental Technology Education (PETE) conferences, publications and Internet database."

This fragile coastal area is threatened by intensive development which has resulted in groundwater, septic system and transportation problems, but the Cape is most seriously threatened by the extensive pollution at the Massachusetts Military Reservation Superfund site on Cape Cod. Since 1994, three higher education institutions, Cape Cod Community College (CCCC), Massachusetts Maritime Academy and University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth, have collaborated to offer students an environmental technology career path that includes a four-year degree, a two-year degree, and three year-long certificate programs. Now Cape Cod Community College and Upper Cape Cod Regional Technical School propose an ATE project that will complete this Environmental Technology education career ladder with an articulated environmental curriculum at the secondary level. The high school students will acquire college credit through Tech Prep courses that will be co-developed by high school and college faculty. These students will have the opportunity to continue their education at CCCC within an AS Degree Program or a transfer concentration that will articulate to a four-year program at Mass. Maritime Academy or U. Mass. Dartmouth. The project will also develop a mentor/mentee program which pairs the college and high school students to receive the field experience recommended by all employers. This mentoring program will be built upon CCCC's well-established internship program, which emerged through the strong support and commitment of local private and public industry representatives. The final project component will be the Sumrner Institute and follow-up workshops, which will provide other secondary teachers in southeastern Massachusetts with the opportunity to receive the me ntor/mentee training and curricula for duplication at their high schools."

For low-income, rural, diverse students, a community college can be the only accessible entry point for higher education, a gateway to STEM careers. Unfortunately, these students face complex barriers that decrease their ability to pursue and successfully complete STEM programs. Over five years, Cape Cod Community College's S-STEM program will fund over fifty scholarships to academically talented students with demonstrated financial need in its engineering, computer science, mathematics, and science programs. In addition to financial support, the STEM Scholars program will employ evidence-based strategies of effective mentoring, academic support, cohort-building, and other interventions to help Scholars persist, transfer to four-year degree programs, and prepare them for STEM careers. To achieve program goals, the college will work with regional high schools and transfer universities. The project will focus on increasing access and entry for low-income, rural, and diverse students initially into STEM programs and then into well-paid, in-demand STEM careers.<br/><br/>Project goals are to increase recruitment, retention, completion, and transfer rates in STEM programs among students who are academically talented and have demonstrated financial need. Evidence-based, comprehensive interventions will be used to promote student success. Students will start by attending a cohort-based orientation designed to develop a shared sense of purpose and community. Faculty mentors will have frequent meetings with students to provide career-focused advising, connect students with resources, and discuss any academic or personal issues that may put student success at-risk. In addition, students will participate in scheduled study groups, tutoring, and supplemental instruction. Transfer advising and visits to transfer universities will be initiated during each student's first term. To support STEM profession exploration, the project will offer industry partner mentoring, industry speaker panels, visits to industry job sites, internship and job shadowing opportunities, and attendance at professional conferences. To create a cohort and a sense of connection, the project will offer opportunities for students to socialize and participate in group identity-building activities. Finally, this project will fund scholarships to address student need. As part of their efforts, the project team will seek to determine which activities have the most impact on student retention, completion, and transfer in STEM programs, particularly among rural students, and why. Dissemination of results will take place in publications, online, and through conferences. This project furthers the goals of the NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program by increasing the number of low-income academically talented students who earn degrees in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program is being developed with partnerships with regional employers, community partners, industry and other entities to design and implement accelerated pathways for jobs requiring a Federal Aviation Administration Airframe & Powerplant (FAA A&P) certificate as well as other aviation and avionics occupations.  With implementation, CCCC will be one of only six community colleges in the United States to offer FAA A&P certification training in an accelerated format, and will be the only public institution of higher education offering the accelerated certificate in eastern New England.  The program responds to a documented regional and national need for a stronger workforce in aviation and avionics.  The proposed curriculum and training addresses industry needs and creates a model accelerated program.  The program is recruiting underrepresented groups including first generation, low income students and veterans.  CCCC is collaborating with K-12 partners within the region, generating a pipeline of students able to fulfill regional labor market needs, including a dual enrollment pathway which increases opportunities for students to enter a high demand, well-paid career field.  The accelerated structure of the program allows participants to reach their professional goals faster, and meet the employer demand.  <br/><br/>The program is structured around three goals:  1) Developing a set of stackable certificates and associate degree program informed by industry that prepares aviation maintenance technicians, 2) creating a viable, cost efficient and guided pathway for high school students who wish to obtain a certificate or associate degree in Aviation Maintenance utilizing a dual enrollment path, and 3) creating an online pathway for workers with experience in the field who wish to prepare for the FAA A&P certification exam.  The program builds upon best practices and utilizes open-source materials and evidence-based strategies, including NSF-funded curriculum materials developed by the South Texas Aviation Maintenance Partnership (STAMP). Five project activities are involved:  1) developing an innovative online curriculum in aviation maintenance for general portions of the program that can be disseminated to other institutions, 2) establishing articulation agreements with Bridgewater State University in Aviation Management, 3) training two initial cohorts of students during the project and grow program enrollment to over 100 students, 4) providing professional development opportunities for aviation program faculty, and 5) continuing to develop relationships with industry partners.  Program evaluation includes both formative evaluation for refinement of project activities and summative evaluation to establish outcomes that will influence the scaling up of efforts beyond the planning phase. Plans include dissemination of program outcomes at regional, state and national conferences, leveraging the impact of the program, and the dissemination of online modules/courses and teaching materials developed."

In an attempt to turn this potential disaster into a success story, a group of state and Federal legislators initiated a state appropriation to encourage three state institutions to develop an environmental education and training program that would prepare students to enter the job market or to continue their education in a baccalaureate program.  Students enrolled in the program have the opportunity to intern with companies working on the clean-up project at the MMR as well as other environmentally related positions.  The new equipment provides the collaborating institutions with the necessary laboratory instrumentation and computer software to meet this challenge.  The laboratory experiments are designed to incorporate the new instrumentation in specific courses in a way that stimulates students and exposes them to real-world field experience.  The targeted population of older students and women who often lack the confidence and academic background to enroll in science/technology programs is far more likely to succeed using a hands-on methodology.  Faculty at each of the institutions are committed to the creation and subsequent refinement of laboratory experiments that teach the essential scientific concepts and their application in the field.  Assessment of student response and success with these exercises can be carefully measured:  employers of interns can be surveyed regarding student performance, and  intern supervisors and other industry representatives acting in an advisory capacity have agreed to assist in an on-going review of the relevance of the laboratory exercises and teaching techniques from the industry point of view.  Dissemination is to occur within the network of Massachusetts community colleges and nationally through the Partners in Environmental Technology Education publications and on-line database.  *"
