Expanding the TEME model to include an oceanographic research simulation will enable Greenfield Community College to provide both college and middle school students with an opportunity to participate in an exciting hands-on science education program that integrates broad scientific content and effective group skills, providing a practical framework for understanding ecological and social problems. The original TEME curriculum model features a simulated shuttle orbiter experience as a metaphor for ""Spaceship Earth."" The TEME model will be adapted to the study of the oceans, using a deep sea submersible simulation as a vehicle for exploring this vast and still mysterious environment. We will add new content to the module program and upgrade the technology to run the simulation. In addition to Greenfield Community College faculty, curriculum specialists, and middle school teachers are involved in the curriculum development. We will develop written curricular materials for middle schools as well as software that can be used on ordinary PCs in the schools. The impact on students will include greater motivation, improved math/science skills development, greater clarity of career goals, and a broader ecological awareness. ***"

The increased availability of data, combined with increased computing power at lower costs, has brought to the desktop tremendous analytical and problem solving capabilities. Yet many organizations are not able to take advantage of these developments because they often lack appropriate staffing to wrestle with complex data science problems. Meanwhile, as students increasingly gravitate toward data science programs, much of their course-based problem solving experience focuses on clean problems with simple data sets. This leaves them unprepared for the reality of the data science applications they will face in professional settings. This project addresses both issues by deploying teams of data science students to assist local organizations, thereby increasing the long-term capacity of the data science workforce.<br/><br/>This is a multifaceted project that will provide immediate impact to local organizations and long-term benefit for students through valuable hands-on data science experience. There are two major components of the proposed project. First, Data Science WAV teams of four specially-trained undergraduate students will be deployed to community-based organizations to Wrangle, Analyze, and Visualize their data. Second, this project will offer summer faculty development workshops designed to help new instructors, especially those at community colleges, teach data science at their institutions. Curricular innovations that bring experiential data science learning into the curriculum will lead to sustained impact at the partnering academic institutions and in the larger Pioneer Valley region. This proposal is diverse across both institutions and student populations. It comprises one major research university (The University of Massachusetts, Amherst), four liberal arts colleges (Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, and Smith), and three local community colleges (Greenfield, Holyoke, and Springfield Technical). The inclusion of two women's colleges (Smith and Mount Holyoke) and two Hispanic-serving institutions (Holyoke and Springfield Technical) will help ensure that a diverse student population is engaged in the project. <br/><br/>NSF's Harnessing the Data Revolution Data Science Corps program focuses on building capacity for harnessing the data revolution at the local, state, national, and international levels to help unleash the power of data in the service of science and society. Projects in this program are being jointly funded by the NSF's Harnessing the Data Revolution Big Idea; the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, Division of Information and Intelligent Systems; the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education; the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Division of Mathematical Sciences; and the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences, Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program will also encourage student outreach and community service and will prepare recipients for careers or continued studies in STEM-related fields.  E2S5 is designed to support students in four STEM disciplines at the college and incorporate experiential learning and internships as student learning outcomes.  Four disciplines will be targeted in this project: Engineering, Environmental Science, Farm and Food Systems, and Renewable Energy/Energy Efficiency.  The program emphasizes recruitment of qualified students to these disciplines, and will build on other college initiatives designed to support STEM students and increase retention.  E2S5 is also designed to facilitate next steps for students to enter the workplace or to continue to baccalaureate granting institutions. Towards this end, the project will build on existing opportunities for experiential site-based learning and internships to deepen science discipline understanding and will provide pathways to jobs or transfer.  Internships will provide students with the best possible experiential learning.  They will provide local businesses and agencies with student energy and expertise, and will help prepare students to become responsive to the need for more American scientists and engineers in the workforce. <br/><br/>The college will use S-STEM grant funds to provide a total of 102 scholarships over a five-year period.  Scholarship criteria are well defined and inclusive to reach broadly into the diverse student body that populates these programs.  Funding plans will be structured to include as many qualified students as possible.   An extensive student support system, including advising and coaching, tutoring and academic support, experiential learning, internship opportunities, career and transfer counseling, and community building special events will be built and scholarship recipients will be expected to participate.  Goals of the project include well-defined and significant improvement in persistence rates.  By the end of the grant period, the PI expects that 95% of the students will either find discipline-related employment or transfer into a related discipline at a baccalaureate granting institution. In terms of the broader impacts, the program will emphasize the priorities of integrating teaching and experiential research and learning, promoting diversity, and encouraging scientific understanding that benefits society. Dissemination of results to the outside community will primarily be accomplished through presentations at discipline specific conferences and at conferences that focus on student learning.  Internally, dissemination will be through presentations to faculty as professional development workshops that focus on learning communities, engaging students in science, problem-based learning, and peer-led team leadership. Findings will help broaden the higher education enterprise's understanding of the attributes and practices of programs that are successful in promoting academic opportunity and quality for students with financial need."

This is accomplished by involving three tiers of public education, local and regional government, business and industry, and professional and trade organizations as partners in developing practices and processes uniquely suited to areas without large employers. The project goals are being met through a series of objectives designed to meet the growing demand from small business enterprises for information technology resources. <br/><br/>The project is increasing access for a diverse, rural population to two and four year post-secondary programs in IT training. It is building upon existing relationships to create a persistent academic stream from high-school to community college to baccalaureate institutions or IT employment. Curriculum is being coordinated and courses are being shared via Internet and distance video platforms. Formal articulation agreements are being drafted and implemented. <br/><br/>The project models how small colleges, many with a strong liberal arts tradition, can develop on-going processes to involve small business and education representatives throughout their service areas to strengthen the regional information technology infrastructure. Rural business and industry are full partners in this process, informing curriculum development and providing student co-op work experiences and externship opportunities for high school teachers and college faculty. Through activities and initiatives developed during annual meetings among guidance, admissions, and transfer personnel, greater numbers of students with diverse backgrounds are becoming involved in IT related fields. Increased computing capacity and infrastructure are being developed and maintained to facilitate inter-institutional cooperation and program development."
