The primary goal of the project is to demonstrate and disseminate a professional development model to engage SMET faculty in the Universal Design of Curricula to support the learning of students with disabilities.  The institution and its project staff will rely on their experience acquired in the Advanced Technical Education (ATE) Center in the design of specialized technical simulation, courseware, and laboratory-based components of SMET curricula.  A cohort of 30 disabled students, half of whom experience sensory disabilities, will be the principal target population upon which the materials are piloted and tested.  Evaluation will include an examination of outcomes of a ""train-the-trainer"" model of professional development, wherein a cohort of SMET faculty are trained and serve as mentors to other faculty within their academic divisions to expand and accelerate the diffusion of Universal Curriculum Design of SMET courses.  The Springfield Technical Community College actively participates in extensive Northeast and national networks of ATE institutions (including both high schools and community colleges) that will permit broad dissemination of the project's results and products.<br/>"

The increased availability of data, combined with increased computing power at lower costs, has brought to the desktop tremendous analytical and problem solving capabilities. Yet many organizations are not able to take advantage of these developments because they often lack appropriate staffing to wrestle with complex data science problems. Meanwhile, as students increasingly gravitate toward data science programs, much of their course-based problem solving experience focuses on clean problems with simple data sets. This leaves them unprepared for the reality of the data science applications they will face in professional settings. This project addresses both issues by deploying teams of data science students to assist local organizations, thereby increasing the long-term capacity of the data science workforce.<br/><br/>This is a multifaceted project that will provide immediate impact to local organizations and long-term benefit for students through valuable hands-on data science experience. There are two major components of the proposed project. First, Data Science WAV teams of four specially-trained undergraduate students will be deployed to community-based organizations to Wrangle, Analyze, and Visualize their data. Second, this project will offer summer faculty development workshops designed to help new instructors, especially those at community colleges, teach data science at their institutions. Curricular innovations that bring experiential data science learning into the curriculum will lead to sustained impact at the partnering academic institutions and in the larger Pioneer Valley region. This proposal is diverse across both institutions and student populations. It comprises one major research university (The University of Massachusetts, Amherst), four liberal arts colleges (Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, and Smith), and three local community colleges (Greenfield, Holyoke, and Springfield Technical). The inclusion of two women's colleges (Smith and Mount Holyoke) and two Hispanic-serving institutions (Holyoke and Springfield Technical) will help ensure that a diverse student population is engaged in the project. <br/><br/>NSF's Harnessing the Data Revolution Data Science Corps program focuses on building capacity for harnessing the data revolution at the local, state, national, and international levels to help unleash the power of data in the service of science and society. Projects in this program are being jointly funded by the NSF's Harnessing the Data Revolution Big Idea; the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, Division of Information and Intelligent Systems; the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education; the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Division of Mathematical Sciences; and the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences, Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A recent study of companies in the region revealed a critical need for more optics and photonics technicians. The demand for these technicians is growing rapidly and surpasses the total number of graduates each year in this technical field. It is essential to motivate, engage, and prepare more students for careers as technicians in advanced photonics manufacturing. A proven method for recruitment is to provide students with meaningful learning experiences that captivate their interest with the kinds of technical problems and challenges technicians encounter on the job. Problem-based learning (PBL) is a powerful method for motivating students, and simultaneously developing the problem solving and critical thinking skills required for the workplace. Springfield Technical Community College is currently the only two-year institution in New England that offers programs in optics and photonics technology. These programs combine project-based and problem-based activities with extensive hands-on experience on state-of-the-art equipment. In this project, the college will work with regional industries and organizations in advanced photonics manufacturing to expand the available library of PBL activities in its programs. Workshops on using PBL in advanced photonics manufacturing education will also be provided to high school and community college instructors across the Northeast. The project will contribute to meeting the demand for well-skilled photonics technicians in the nation's workforce.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to increase the number of photonics technicians prepared with the knowledge and skills needed to sustain and grow the advanced photonics manufacturing industry in the Northeast region of the United States. The proposed effort will build on previous work by the investigators to promote use of the PBL approach in developing problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork skills among students. The project will: 1) create eight new multimedia PBL modules featuring real-world problems developed with input from industry partners across New England and New York; 2) provide professional development for high school and college-level educators on photonics technologies and strategies for using the PBL pedagogy; 3) develop a comprehensive recruitment strategy for increasing the number of high school and community college students who pursue career pathways in photonics; and 4) research the efficacy of the PBL approach on improving technician education in advanced photonics manufacturing.

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. <br/><br/>Engineering is an important component of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).  However, resources for supporting teachers in implementing these standards are scarce.  This project will address the need for resources by applying an innovative pedagogy called Imaginative Education (IE) to create middle school engineering curricula.  In IE, developmentally appropriate narratives are used to design learning environments that help learners engage with content and organize their knowledge productively.  To fully exploit the potential of this pedagogy, this project will combine IE with transmedia storytelling.  In transmedia storytelling, different elements of a narrative are spread across a variety of formats (such as books, websites, new articles, videos and other media) in a way that creates a coordinated experience for the user.  Once created, the curricula will be implemented in classrooms to research its impact on (1) increasing learners' capacities to engage in both innovative and direct application of engineering concepts, and (2) improving learners'  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) identity.  <br/><br/>This research will be led by Smith College and Springfield Technical Community College in collaboration with Springfield (MA) Public Schools (SPS).  Additional expertise in evaluating the findings will be provided by the Collaborative for Educational Services and an external advisory board of leaders in STEM education and transmedia storytelling.  The project will result in the development of a transmedia learning environment that includes two NGSS-aligned, interdisciplinary engineering units and seven lessons that integrate science and engineering.  The research study will be implemented in four phases in eight SPS middle schools.  Approximately 900 students will participate each year.  In Phase 1, the project team will collaborate with SPS teachers to create engineering units, lessons, and standards-based achievement measures.  In Phase 2, teachers in the treatment group will participate in professional development (PD) workshops covering IE, transmedia learning environments, structure of the curriculum, and connections to NGSS.  In Phase 3 the curricula will be implemented in treatment classrooms and both treatment and control group students will be assessed.  In Phase 4, testing and assessment will continue in SPS schools and will be expanded to rural and suburban classrooms.  Teachers in these classrooms will use online multimedia PD that will ensure scalability and mirrors the structure and content of in-person PD.  Data analysis will provide evidence of whether this imaginative and transmedia educational approach improves students' capacities for using engineering concepts and enhances their STEM identity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This request is made because the technical considerations involved in designing and configuring the visual information for the Internet is an area into which our students should be venturing but cannot, because our current facilities have no capability for the lab experiments.  As information providers increasingly make use of the Internet, the benefits of being able to provide detailed moving images and user interactivity with the content are becoming clear. But the costs of such enabling solutions as fiber optic delivery have so far proven overwhelming, even to such large enterprises as telephone companies.  We see increased experimentation looking for ways to improve data throughput on the Intimate as being desirable, but there are also possibilities for reducing the data demands of the material being fed into the Intimate. In the creation of moving images/sounds in windows controlled with selection buttons, there are a number of technical approaches which result in better quality and interactivity without increased bandwidth.  The experiments outlined in this proposal seek to explore the tactics and techniques by which aspects of the information may be data-reduced while maintaining acceptable qualities as perceived by the user. The experiments pertain to two avenues of concern:    1) Finding the best techniques for reducing bandwidth demands for Internet-destined materials and CD-ROM-destined materials in motion    2) Finding the best techniques for providing enhanced user interactivity with these two media, up to and including digital simulation of using real-world instrumentation.  With the Digital Media Interactive Micro-Network lab facility requested, our students could enter the realm of these technical challenges by performing the listed experi ments themselves and evaluating the results in both qualitative and quantitative terms. This lab is being envisioned as a micro-miniature working model of a world of CD-ROM and Internet       . . _ _ . , ."

The research questions are: What is the quality of the knowledge building discourse? Does it get better over time? Will students, given the opportunity, extend the discourse to new areas? What scaffolding does the learning environment need to support novice participants in this discourse? Does the use of narrative influence participation in knowledge building? Are certain types of narratives more effective in influencing participation in knowledge building?<br/><br/>The website Talk to Me (TTM) will provide engineering education curriculum that facilitates interactive knowledge building through the use of narratives and interactive multimedia. The TTM website will include evaluative feedback for usability, value effectiveness and ease of implementation from informal educators and leaders from the Connecticut After School Network. Outcomes include demonstrated understanding of the nature of engineering and engineering concepts, increased interest, integrative thinking and ability to apply engineering concepts, and incorporate TTM resources. The evaluation will include: documentation on the impact of narrative and multimedia tools in the area of engineering education.<br/><br/>Currently, there is very little research regarding children and young teen engagement in engineering education activities using narrative as a structure to facilitate learning engineering concepts and principles. This online education program will deliver narratives that are developmentally structured by Imaginative Education through the engagement of children and young teens via interactive forums and blogs, young adult novels (audio and text with English and Spanish versions), eight extensive tie-in activities, social network connections and electronic portfolios for middle school age students and afterschool program site directors.

The Center differs from other ATE centers in that it focuses on institutional processes of ATE centers and projects that result in sustainability of programs and long-term impacts on technician education.  Past work has emphasized three major types of activities: 1) building community by working with other centers and projects; 2) empowering others by using social media and emerging technologies to generate discussion and share resources; and 3) connecting centers and industry to leverage knowledge within the community and beyond.   In this extension, the Center continues these activities, but also focuses on collecting evidence that developing CoPs and working with other centers and projects positively impacts the quality of technician education.  <br/><br/>The evaluation plan details questions that directly track how process-oriented resource-sharing ""the essence of CoPs"" improves organizational efficiencies and leads to lasting changes in: 1) the management of the centers and projects; 2) the way that centers and projects interact with each other, with other community colleges and industry to sustain the objectives of the ATE program; and 3) the way that they interact with their students.  The evaluation of this transitional year also focuses on: 1) identifying the changes that occurred in the behavior and operations of ATE centers and projects after seeking guidance from the ICT Center and the CoP; 2) tracking how these changes lead to improvements in technician education; and 3) identifying how the improvements impacted students.  <br/><br/>The strength of the ATE program is that it is a community and not just a series of projects.  The community is established and nurtured by having a few projects and centers that mainly work with other projects and centers.  This proposal studies the extent to which communities of practice can lead to outcomes that improve scientific and technical education at associate degree-granting institutions."

Second, it will broadly disseminate the materials through established networks such as the Advanced Technological Education Centers. Third, the project will develop teacher and faculty expertise in IoT and active-learner technologies. Fourth, it will interest under-represented groups in STEM fields by recruiting K-12 students into summer workshops. It is vitally important that the United States be at the forefront of the development of this technology and has a workforce that can install, maintain, and update this emerging technology. This project has the potential to provide the necessary curricula and training to teachers, who can educate the IoT technicians needed to work in this critical and evolving area. <br/><br/>This multi-interdisciplinary project aims to improve STEM-related undergraduate education in electronics, computing, and networking technology areas.

The learning tools are a set of models of cells and cell components that were initially created in clay using a Universal Design for Learning (UDL) approach during funding from a previous NSF grant. These new models are now made in plastic for more wide scale testing, and four hypotheses regarding student usage and instructor classroom practices are being tested.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of developing UDL cell models is recognizable at many levels.  Students use the UDL models in interactive and dynamic ways to model any cell type they view in lab; the models are also tactile, providing an additional path to learning, and facilitating learning about cells for the visually impaired.  As students manipulate the UDL models to create accurate examples of cell types, they progress through steps that mimic the four stages of Kolb's learning theory; this should enable better and deeper learning when using the UDL models than without. Improved learning is suggested by preliminary quantitative data on the use of the UDL models in an introductory biology class.  This data is not entirely impartial, because there was no ability to control for individual teachers in the study, but it does indicate that use of the UDL models may prove beneficial in mastering concepts in cell biology. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the use of UDL models are extensive. Learning about cells can be very challenging for students, and using a UDL approach to learning could make this concept more accessible for them. Use of the UDL cell models provides an interactive method for learning, lessening the likelihood that the topic will prove boring to introductory biology students and thus decreasing their chances of attrition from biology courses and careers. Although no cell model can perfectly mimic a real cell, the additional information provided by the UDL cell models could make a deeper understanding of cell concepts available to more learners. As future teachers progress through biology courses where UDL cell models are used, they may also be more likely to incorporate UDL approaches in their future teaching.  The models are planned to be made in large quantities to be available for widespread classroom use."
