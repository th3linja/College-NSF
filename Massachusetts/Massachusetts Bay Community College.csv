The plan starts by targeting high school students during the junior year and provides a program leading to certification and/or associates degrees.  This project aims to address state of Massachusetts and national workforce needs for trained technicians.  The program therefore engages high school-aged youth and community college students in learning electronics, coding, and engineering design and manufacturing through an interdisciplinary project-based approach that serves as a launching point along technical career pathways such as information technology technical hardware support, computer numerical control (CNC) operation, computer aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM), and others.  The project is designed to broaden participation by recruiting, retaining, and preparing students from underrepresented populations in STEM.  To attract and engage students, the project is creating a year-long course sequence co-taught by MBCC STEM faculty from multiple departments.  The courses are designed to mirror learning and work in the workplace by engaging students in applying critical thinking skills and leveraging technical knowledge and skills from many content areas.  The courses, available for college credit for high school students in the junior to senior years, allow the students to get a head start on post-secondary education and retain admitted MBCC students in STEM fields.  Partnerships with local organizations and industry will help provide career guidance and find internship opportunities for students.  A web-based mentoring program will aid retention by connecting participants with STEM professionals.<br/><br/>The project has a research goal to provide the community with an evidence-based model around how program components support or do not support students to pursue a STEM career pathway.  The study focuses on the role of intentionality and adaptability as optimal outcomes of engaging in STEM education.  Using an expanded version of Navarro's (et alia, 2007) Math/Science Intentions and Goals Scale and Savickas' & Porfeli's (2012) Career Adapt-Abilities Scale, the project is studying 1) intention, referring to ""orientation toward action,"" by examining intentions to pursue a STEM career pathway and to actively consider STEM careers and 2) career adaptability which is a psychosocial construct denoting an individual's resources of self-regulation or capacity for coping with tasks, transitions, and traumas in occupational roles.   A key hypothesis is that the interventions will enhance individuals' skills for self-regulation and will develop their capacity to internalize these skills."

For ten years the program has successfully guided nontraditional scholars into STEM careers particularly in the field sciences. The RIMES Program provides nontraditional undergraduate scholars from the University of Massachusetts (UMASS), minority serving institutions, and community colleges nationwide with rare, stimulating and extensive research experiences on the volcanic Caribbean island of Montserrat (British Lesser Antilles). The unique geological records of Montserrat provide opportunities for interdisciplinary research on environmental stress, restoration and species adaptation, and form the backdrop for captivating research experiences for underrepresented students that foster enthusiastic participation and elevate the chances that their career choices will fall within these disciplines. Undergraduate scholars in the RIMES Program conduct two consecutive years of highly interdisciplinary research with an international consortium of scientists, headed by Dr. Jackson, studying the environmental impact of Montserrat?s active Souiffre Hills volcano on the terrestrial, aquatic and marine ecosystems of that island. Of great importance, the RIMES Program also positively impacts the scientific careers of faculty from historically black colleges and universities and community colleges as well as the research prowess of their respective institutions. The RIMES Program also provides extensive research experiences seldom afforded to scholars from two-year colleges. RIMES scholars are also supported by an enveloping mentoring program that constantly monitors and sustains their academic endeavors and integrates their research and scholastic activities. The RIMES Program has a retention rate of ninety percent. The RIMES model has demonstrated its ability to increase participation by underrepresented groups in the field sciences. RIMES Scholars and their faculty mentors work together to investigate the impact of volcanic activity on the ecosystem of Montserrat and make a significant intellectual contribution to multiple scientific disciplines and the island. The RIMES Program has demonstrated high success and is a proven, highly replicable model that stimulates the interest of nontraditional scholars for the field sciences. The RIMES Program disseminates its findings to the global scientific and lay communities via publications; conferences, seminars, ReefCheck®, and the program web site (http://www.uml.edu/rimes/). In 2008 under a Fulbright Scholarship, Dr. Jackson worked to replicate his successful mentoring Model at the Catholic University of Portugal, Porto and bring that institution into the RIMES consortium."

The program  provides participants up to 2 years of intensive research  training in molecular biology through the Biotechnology (BT)  Programs at Massachusetts Bay Community College (MBCC).  Concomitant or prior admission to the BT program at MBCC is  a prerequisite for entry into the ROMP. The majority of  research training occurs in the BT laboratories at MBCC, the  most advanced undergraduate research facility in the nation.  However, each ROMP student undertakes at least one summer  research externship at one of over 50 eminent research  institutions in the United States and abroad.  Representative of these are the Marine Biological  Laboratory, Woods Hole; the Texas Medical Center, Galveston;  The University of Edinburgh, Scotland, and the Molecular  Biology Institute of the University of Quebec, Canada.  For  every student admitted, the ROMP begins with an intensive 10-  week molecular-biology research project conducted at MBCC in  the summer preceding their Fall entry into the BT program.  The projects are designed to be expandable and extend into  the subsequent academic year.  During the academic year, all  ROMP students are assigned 4 or 5 entering Freshman BT  students who must conduct tangential sub-projects under the  direction of ROMP students.  This mentoring role is designed  to foster leadership skills and research-management skills  in ROMP students.  In the second summer of the ROMP,  participants can undertake a challenging research externship  at one the many foreign and domestic research institutions  that collaborate with the ROMP.  Summer research projects  are then extended into the second and final year of the  Program as described above.  ROMP students are assisted in  advancing to baccalaureate or graduate-degree programs by  MBCC, which h olds numerous transfer and application-  articulation agreements with colleges and universities  throughout the United States and abroad."

The ROMP Program at Massachusetts Bay Community College (MBCC) is a very rigorous 12-month (minimal) to 24 month (maximum) research training program. The purpose of the ROMP is to confer on its participants an overwhelming competitive advantage that will ensure their completion of the terminal degree in the basic sciences with distinction. The ROMP is tightly linked to the associate degree programs in Biotechnology at MBCC: Biotechnology, Marine Biotechnology and Forensic DNA Science. ROMP participants must therefore be enrolled as full-time students in one of the Biotechnology Programs.<br/><br/>ROMP students undertake summer research projects at collaborative institutions worldwide, which are advanced in the ensuing academic year in the BT Program at MBCC. The Biotechnology Program's research laboratories at MBCC are a multi-million dollar facility and are considered the most sophisticated undergraduate research facilities in the United States. During the academic year students develop their independent research prowess through their collaborative projects, are required to give multiple research presentations and must generate at least one publishable abstract per year. Research opportunities in the ROMP are extensive and include molecular biology, marine biology, environmental science, and forensic DNA analysis of human, animal and plant genomes and DNA-based anthropological studies. Examples of ROMP research projects include: studies in the changes in gene expression in human cells; volcano-induced fish speciation on the Caribbean island of Montserrat; and tracing African-American roots using DNA analysis. The African-American ""Roots Project"" was begun in 2000 and has bought ROMP students international attention. Faculty- and peer mentoring are key components of the ROMP. Second year ROMP students must mentor first year participants to a high degree of scientific proficiency. In addition ROMP students are required to mentor primary school children of Boston during the course of the academic year. We expect that ROMP participants will instill a passion for science in young minority students during the critical formative years of primary school. <br/><br/>A number of ROMP students are now enrolled in basic science doctoral programs nationwide. We anticipate that the ROMP will discernibly increase the number of active, nontraditional people in the American scientific community. <br/>"

Unemployment or underemployment of a high percentage of these recent college graduates is problematic for the economic vitality of our nation. These students do not contribute to the nation's economic growth through either their intellectual skills or their spending power.<br/><br/>In this project, Northeastern University and MassBay Community College are collaboratively implementing an innovative TRANSFORM model to retool the skill set of liberal arts college graduates to prepare them for careers in manufacturing. The project is enabling the targeted population to step into the advanced manufacturing jobs that otherwise go unfilled due to shortage of qualified job seekers nationwide. The TRANSFORM program is also increasing the awareness of manufacturing careers among members of underrepresented groups.<br/>The TRANSFORM model is using the share-the-burden approach among the concerned constituents (government, industry and technical education providers). The modular, 12-month fast-track curriculum of the TRANSFORM program includes courses and internships. The industry-based internships are providing students with project-based learning experience to facilitate students' career transition. TRANSFORM is offering a scalable pedagogically proven manufacturing curriculum for liberal arts graduates that can be replicated at the local, regional, and national levels, and in other sectors such as energy. Social media is being used to reach out to liberal arts graduates on a broad scale.<br/>The three guiding evaluation questions for this project are:<br/>1) What is an appropriate model of self-efficacy associated with preparing the target population to confidently and capably enter the manufacturing workforce?<br/>2) Do the various components of the program successfully prepare the target population to enter the manufacturing workforce?<br/>3) What institutional capacities are needed to sustain the program over time?"
