For example, it ranks fourth in the nation for concentration of pharmaceutical industries.  The existing Biotechnology Program at Madison Area Technical College has a 90% job placement rate, but does not produce sufficient graduates to meet regional industry demands.  This project will establish a nine-credit Biotechnology Program for liberal arts and undeclared students at Madison Area Technical College.  By integrating biotechnology laboratory skills and career development experiences into the general biology curriculum, more students may be attracted to bioscience technician careers. The project will develop undergraduate research experiences, internships, and digital badges to assess and document student mastery of key biotechnology skills. The nine-credit certificate program, which includes coursework in basic laboratory techniques and concepts, will provide students with the knowledge and skills needed to gain employment in the biotechnology industry.  Offering this certificate program to liberal arts/undeclared students who are not in the biotechnology career pipeline has the potential to increase the pool of qualified biotech employees.  <br/> <br/>This project involves a collaboration between the Biology department and Biotechnology associate degree program at the Madison Area Technical College, and the Wisconsin Crop Innovation Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  These partners will develop and implement a bioscience curriculum with the unifying theme of food security. This curriculum will be designed to incorporate the core competencies of undergraduate biology education and core skill standards for bioscience technicians.  The project activities will provide liberal arts/undeclared students an opportunity at Madison Area Technical College to complete a biotechnology certificate and participate in digital badging system designed to communicate these skills to industry.  Partnership with the Wisconsin Crop Innovation Center will provide students with internship experiences to hone skills and make industry connections. These activities have the potential to increase the number of students who have skills in demand for biotechnology jobs, improve and grow academic and industry opportunities, and increase access to STEM careers for all students. Students and key academic advisors (high school teachers, guidance counselors and administration) will be able to learn more about the academic programming available for bioscience students and associated bioscience careers through newly developed ""Bioscience Career Roadmaps.""<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Madison Area Technical College, in collaboration with the Institute for Chemical Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the American Chemical Society (ACS) and area science centers and museums will create a national program to disseminate the FST model which directly engages children in playful, participatory, and inquiry-based science learning of chemistry and physics topics. The primary target audience is children aged 4-11, while undergraduate chemistry students, faculty, and formal and informal educators comprise the secondary professional audience. The project will result in the development of a robust, creative, and highly visible national dissemination program.<br/><br/>The National Training and Dissemination Program includes three deliverables. First, a Distance Performance Training Program will be developed to teach groups of undergraduate students, faculty, and educators how to perform FST Science Investigation (SI) Shows. The Training Program includes a Performance Training Package and a 3-day Performance Training Workshop. The Performance Training Package will be comprised of training videos, performances videos, scripts, rehearsal schedules, and training exercises. These materials will be pilot tested while training representatives of five groups from around the country to perform SI Shows during the Performance Training Workshop at Madison Area Technical College in summer 2012. Participants will be selected from ACS undergraduate groups, outreach specialists, and museum professionals. Workshop participants then return to their home institutions and lead their groups through the improved Performance Training Package delivered via Moodle, with support from FST team members and social networking tools. The second deliverable is the FST Methods Workshop. The Methods Workshop is designed to teach formal and informal educators to use selected methods (Investigation Question, Embedded Assessment, and Act-It-Out) in their outreach efforts and classroom teaching. Four workshops will be presented at national meetings and at the invitation of colleges, universities, and science centers. Follow-up with workshop participants will be mediated through an online forum to encourage experimentation, modification, and dissemination of a second generation of FST activities. The final project deliverable is the development and implementation of a Promotion and Recruitment Plan to connect professional audiences with FST. The Distance Performance Training Program and workshops will be evaluated using mixed methods, while embedded assessment will be utilized to measure the impact on youth participants attending SI shows to determine the overall effectiveness the Distance Performance Training.<br/><br/>This project is designed to have important impacts on STEM education and society. The proposed dissemination program brings innovative models and methods into the hands of informal science education practitioners who can use them to engage local audiences and enhance their own teaching and communication practices. Finally the project offers likely benefits for society through the creation and dissemination of innovative practices to combat science illiteracy, diminishing pools of scientists and engineers, lack of understanding about the nature of science, and the achievement gap that exacerbates these problems. This project could be transformative in informal science education as SI Shows use theater to engage audiences in multiple aspects of science learning. It is anticipated that this project will reach up to 2,500 individuals in public and professional audiences."

This series, which can be easily integrated into existing 2-year college programs, includes introductory renewable energy, energy management, alternative transportation, photovoltaic, solar home design, wind power, and biomass courses.  Until the North American Board of Energy Practitioners and other industry-sanctioned accrediting agencies can certify these courses, the College is issuing certificates for them.  The project includes industry and renewable energy association experts to develop a review process and a stamp of approval that will be noted on the certificate.<br/><br/>To complement the online courses, the project is developing a series of web-based learning objects that give learners virtual access to renewable energy technologies and inquiry-based pedagogy.  The project plans to conduct one large summer institute to introduce and promote the online courses and the learning objects to other faculty.

The project uses a simple, but practical model that makes a prestigious group of experts from around the country and virtual laboratory experiences available to everyone. It provides the infrastructure and the vision to bring emerging and disparate renewable energy technologies together into a cohesive structure that two-year colleges can readily embrace.  The model also includes a provision to bring seasoned renewable energy teachers into the 2-year college classroom immediately.  Finally, it includes cutting-edge pedagogy through learner-centered, interactive learning objects. <br/> <br/>Broad Impact <br/>This project empowers faculty and institutions to take advantage of the rapidly developing interdisciplinary technologies that can revitalize educational programs and create new ones.  As such, it is a powerful model of the two-year college as an agent of change to meet emerging economic and workforce development needs.  A key feature of this model is the evolution of existing 2-year college programs to provide new pathways for renewable energy technicians. The courses and the learning objects provide access to experts in the field using innovative, learner-centered strategies.  These strategies provide a flexible way to stay abreast of new developments as they are easily scaled up or down for new technologies. <br/>"

The mechanism of integration will involve: (1) the initiation and expanded use of elective research credits creating joint projects between electron microscopy students and students from other areas, (2) faculty and students from other disciplines using our microscopy laboratory facility, and (3) the microscopy facility being used for demonstrations and instructional presentation by faculty from other instructional areas. In addition, we hope to implement a course for electron microscopy students involving projects supervised by industry and/or other educational institutions. This goal, if realized, will allow non-microscopy students the rare opportunity to discover and understand how electron microscopy impacts their areas of major study. The exchange will afford microscopy students a valuable opportunity to experience the broad range of microscope utilization by the many disciplines and academic areas routinely using electron microscopy. The electron microscopy laboratory facility is adequate to meet this increased student and faculty use except for x-ray microanalysis and image processing capability. Currently only one scanning electron microscope is equipped with both capabilities. Our plan is to obtain an x-ray analyzer capable of image processing and interfacing it with two x-ray detectors (one is already on hand) installed to two scanning electrons microscopes (also on hand). Thus, two microscopes can have this capability for little more cost than a sin gle microscope installation. ***"

By developing and delivering an intensive and practical one-semester certificate program for unemployed/underemployed individuals with baccalaureate degrees (or equivalent), this program offers these students a bridge to the regulated biotechnology workplace. It is not unusual for individuals with baccalaureate degrees to attend two-year colleges in order to develop practical work place skills to supplement the theoretical understanding gained from a four-year program. However, two-year biotechnology programs have not had the resources to create instructional materials and to provide separate programming for these post-baccalaureate individuals and so have placed them in pre-existing associate degree courses. While this approach has successfully helped some baccalaureate graduates transition into the work place, the length of time required to complete various associate degree courses, and the pace of instruction in these classes, is not suitable for graduates of four-year institutions. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project develops, delivers, and disseminates up-to-date and accurate instructional materials for post-baccalaureate students, relating underlying science concepts to the modern biotechnology workplace.

Since each of these devices has its own individual Supervisory Controls and Data Acquisition (SCADA) communications output, this has also resulted in an explosion of data for renewable energy system operators. The data from a SCADA system can have enormous value for renewable energy system owners, operators, and the greater community. Therefore, the Center for Renewable Energy Advanced Technological Education (CREATE), in collaboration with industry and academic partners, aims to advance the use of SCADA technology for the energy sector.  SCADA technology is of crucial importance to the electric industry to manage the extraordinary growth in renewable energy installations, while also ensuring the security and resilience of our nation's electric grid.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to advance renewable energy education by enabling faculty leaders to integrate SCADA into existing energy technician educational programs. SCADA systems are core technology for the operation of many key industrial processes, including oil and gas refining, food and beverage production, water treatment, and electric power production. SCADA systems allow engineering technicians to control systems in real time, and log data for monitoring of system performance. SCADA data analytics allow for system optimization, preventive maintenance scheduling, and for rapid detection and correction of faults and alarms to prevent or minimize system downtime.  This project will result in the creation of an educational open source SCADA system that will be deployed and shared among participating colleges and universities nationwide. Technician education in SCADA technology will be advanced through a series of professional development workshops for college and university faculty, and SCADA instructional activities will be integrated into existing courses and curricula for undergraduate energy technician education programs. The project will have enormous impact on the renewable energy sector, ultimately benefitting society by providing more reliable and lower cost energy to consumers, while creating a more resilient energy grid and reducing the environmental impact of America's energy sector.
