The College will undertake a comprehensive assessment of community needs as well as institutional strengths and weaknesses in STEM fields. <br/><br/>Assessment outcomes will drive systemic reform strategies, lead to more effective use of limited resources and further the development of the nation's technologically based workforce.  Primary goals of the project are threefold: (1) assessment of community and employer needs and opportunities for STEM-related education and professionals; (2) identification of strategies for increasing student enrollment, retention and graduation in STEM foundation courses and program areas; and, (3) evaluation of STEM student performance to eliminate bottlenecks and strengthen STEM competencies.<br/>"

By diversifying the pool of documenters and broadening participation of underrepresented groups, a more comprehensive record of linguistic behavior can result. This project will diversify and build corpora for two endangered Algonquian languages, by cultivating indigenous language specialists to record new documentation of these Native American languages, and to transcribe and translate archival recordings.  In the United States, the Native American Languages Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990, enacted into policy the recognition of the unique status and importance of these languages. The number of Native Americans documenting their own language is small, but growing. This project also has the potential to increase scholarly understanding of how a record's comprehensiveness can be addressed when heritage learners of the language lead the projects. It will record previously undocumented women's language, historical narratives from boarding school, and traditional knowledge of the natural world, plus make archival recordings usable through transcription. This will increase scholarly understanding of linguistic change in Algonquian languages and of scientific knowledge in ethnobotany and other areas. It will create publicly available corpora for testing linguistic hypotheses. Broader impacts include collaborative professional development opportunities in the language sciences for indigenous scholars and research opportunities for Native American undergraduates. It will also build capacity in linguistics and language documentation at two tribal colleges and result in materials usable in language revitalization in schools and regional communities.  The project is co-funded by the NSF Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP).<br/><br/>This project is a collaborative partnership between the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee and Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwa Community College and Saginaw Chippewa Tribal College. It will increase the use, documentation, instruction and research of two endangered Algonquian languages indigenous to the Great Lakes area: Chippewa, also known as Anishinaabemowin; and Menominee, also known as Mamaceqtaw. Menominee is the heritage language of only one community in Wisconsin while Chippewa is the heritage language of over 200 communities in the United States and Canada. Both languages are extremely endangered today with very few first-language speakers and no households using Chippewa or Menominee as the primary language. Each institution has tailored its project to local community needs, aimed at filling the gaps in the existing record and making archival materials usable through transcription.  The merit and impact of this project lie in the kinds of information encoded in the recordings, as well as the creation of a corpora of transcriptions to conduct novel linguistic investigations. Results include the documentation of fluent women speakers of Chippewa on topics such as astronomy, ethnobotany and the geosciences, among others. Another component will record elders' historical recollections, including Chippewa narratives of boarding schools.  Menominee archival recordings will be transcribed in collaboration with the Great Lakes Inter Tribal Council and new recordings will be made in partnership with Menominee teachers and students in the region."

By collaborating in this partnership, and working with businesses and industrial partners, the unique needs of underserved populations are being addressed. The Information Technology program is a shared offering that provides online specializations ranging from certificates in basic computer and Intenet skills to a complete four-year degree. The courses in this program are being mirrored, credit for credit, by each institution so that whatever a student earns at one college transfers to the other college. Faculty and staff of both institutions are developing program content in a collaborative effort where new online courses are being developed and existing synchronous courses are being adapted and made available. A virtual private network is being implemented between the partners in order to allow the development of systems integration of support services. Business and industry are partnering with the higher education institutions to help create the skilled information technology workforce needed to meet their needs and strengthen the economies of the Native American and rural communities served by the colleges. Full accreditation for the program is being sought from the North Central Association of Schools and Colleges. Evaluation and assessment of the development of online content is an ongoing, dynamic process from conceptualization to implementation of curricula that is being documented and published as a model for the development of learning in an asynchronous environment."

The College population is 95% Native American, of which 70% are women. Due to the isolation of the Northern Wisconsin woodlands and the limited resources of the students, the College has become the focal point of educational services within the area. Prefiously science courses were taught with a minimum of laboratory work. Instuctors prepared demonstrations for students to view in the local high school laboratory which is not equipped for scientific investigation beyond the secondary curriculum. The new laboratory equipment is providing the means to begin to explore Biology and Chemistry beyond the post-secondary level. Furthermore, Native American students are being given the opportunity to research scientific concepts at the experimental level which is consistent with Native American learning styles. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources."

Firstly, a Web of Learning curriculum will be <br/>developed and integrated into the current curriculum structure.  Secondly, a Sustainable Living Institute will be the <br/>vehicle in which the Web of Learning model is guided, implemented and integrated.  Thirdly, the primary focus of <br/>the Sustainable Living Institute will be concentrated towards ensuring student success.  These three elements will <br/>promote a sustainable and long-lasting academic structure that will influence the way STEM is approached at <br/>LCOOCC.  Three primary goals are outlined for this grant: <br/> <br/>Goal I: To institutionalize the concepts, issues, and technologies of sustainable living, by incorporating traditional <br/>Ojibwa Environmental Knowledge (OEK), STEM knowledge and skills through a learning communities approach <br/>which will improve the STEM literacy of all degree-seeking students entitled the Web of Learning Model (WOL). <br/>Goal II: To ensure effective implementation of the Web of Learning Model (WOL), a Sustainability Living Institute <br/>(SLI) will be developed to ensure that the its curricula promoting STEM knowledge and skills will be implemented <br/>and applicable to student and community need based partnerships. <br/>Goal III: The Sustainable Living Institute using the Web of Learning curricula which promotes STEM knowledge <br/>and skills and incorporates experiential learning opportunities will facilitate, encourage and ensure student success."
