Business, industry and its workers are demanding that these competencies be made available in easily accessible learning formats in order to accommodate the pace of technological change.  Schools, however, are faced with rising costs and the service needs of changing student groups.    The mission of the TECH SPAN Program is to develop applied manufacturing curriculum which provides for the flexible delivery of technical education to first time and returning students, and workers in an internationally competitive environment.    TECH SPAN will develop manufacturing curriculum in technology-supported instructional packages.  TECH SPAN will create a framework on which to base a sustainable system of curriculum development and delivery at the undergraduate and secondary school levels, especially for technicians being educated for the high performance workplace.  This project will result in major improvements in advanced technological education in manufacturing, serve as a model for other institutions and states, assure that secondary and postsecondary students acquire strong foundations in mathematics and science, and produce nationally-usable educational products.    The TECH SPAN Program will a) develop 11 manufacturing technical core competencies into modules and instructional materials using the Wisconsin Instructional Design System (a computerized, performance-based instructional design system); b) research the most effective delivery method/materials for providing manufacturing technician training in multiple delivery formats (i.e., traditional, audio, visual, digitized, CD-ROM, Internet, etc.); c) produce computerbased, self-paced, multi-media manufacturing curriculum, d) develop educational professionals in traditional and non-traditional educational delivery systems; and e) disseminate information on the process and the educational products developed."

This project addresses a shortage of skilled technicians in those areas by developing a technology rich, two-year curriculum. The curriculum meets Manufacturing Skills Standards Certification (MSSC) and National Institute for Metalworking Skills (NIMS) standards. This project builds upon a one-year technical diploma curriculum in Metal Fabrication/Welding, by expanding it into a two-year associate degree and offering MSSC and NIMS certification modules. A multi-state steering committee is assembled comprised of industry experts in curriculum development and manufacturing technology, including representatives from several ATE centers. Steering committee members identified cutting edge technical, academic, and life skill competencies needed to prepare advanced manufacturing technicians for a labor market that requires postsecondary education with MSSC and NIMS certification. To gather this information, the steering committee surveyed regional manufacturers whose work centers on manufacturing robotic systems. The curriculum produced will be disseminated to technical/community colleges nationwide to help effectively educate, train, and certify students in robotically-based advanced manufacturing and welding programs. The curriculum will be in a digital format allowing dissemination through the Worldwide Curriculum Databank, FLATE, and NCME."
