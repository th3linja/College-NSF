As a unique program in Wisconsin's two-year technical college system, FVTC educates over 200 students annually from throughout the State to work as technicians in areas such as soil conservation, environmental protection, wildlife management, and forestry preservation. Without GIS/GPS laboratory equipment, the Natural Resources program is at a continuous improvement stalemate - all meaningful curriculum development responding to occupational skill demand involves GIS/GPS technology. The most serious indicator of need is the fact that job placement of graduates has been negatively impacted due to lack of contemporary technology skills. Project objectives focus upon staff development for the six program instructors to learn GIS/GPS technology for the development of laboratory learning activities in program courses including: Soil Conservation, Outdoor Recreation, Common Topics, and Surveying. Laboratory activities will include authentic data collection and analysis projects that provide environmental information for use by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and other land use and conservation agencies. Professional authenticity and relevancy of the curriculum will be evaluated by practitioners in a variety of natural resource occupations. The integrated curriculum will be shared with interested associate degree educators in collaboration with GIS/GPS vendors and related conferences. A Science Teacher Institute for K-12 teachers will enable GIS/GPS projects to be developed for elementary and secondary students."

The NSF-ATE TECH SPAN project has developed a common manufacturing curriculum isolating twelve core competency clusters that cut across over forty manufacturing/engineering related technical degree programs. The Wisconsin Online Resource Center, a FIPSE-LAAP project focused on a general education digital learning library, builds web-based learning objects that are designed and linked to a competency driven curriculum. This NSF-ATE project is adapting this Center framework to create a manufacturing digital library, and multimedia-based chunks of learning are being designed that stimulate and accelerate student understanding of core concepts. In addition, a post-associate degree advanced technological certificate in emerging industrial practices of integrated cellular manufacturing is under development using an associated learning object collection in the digital library. Secondary teachers, prospective teachers in industrial technology, and community-based trainers of disadvantaged women and minorities are being trained in Center resources to inspire the next generation of manufacturing technicians."

The MDFP seeks to integrate Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)-based Digital Fabrication capabilities and resources into student learning experiences at the undergraduate levels of higher education. The major goals of the project are to: 1) integrate Digital Fabrication Laboratories into selected Product Realization courses to provide enhanced, hands-on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) learning experiences; 2) assess the ability of Digital Fabrication Laboratory experiences to enhance student STEM competencies and attitudes; and 3) evaluate Digital Fabrication Laboratories as a STEM recruitment vehicle. This initiative also integrates program disciplines with Digital Fabrication orientation through development of articulation agreements between the three colleges.<br/><br/>A cross-disciplinary Fab Lab project team is being established utilizing staff and experts from the three colleges in the Mechanical Design, Applied Engineering Technology, Manufacturing Technologies, Information Technology, and Electrical-Electronics based programs. The team is identifying selected courses in their respective programs that have Digital Fabrication relevance for hands-on learning activities. <br/>To support this initiative, partner institutions are transforming existing laboratory space into new Digital Fabrication Laboratories with incremental capital equipment investments."

The requested equipment enables the development of process control training to prepare technicians better for the maintenance and operation of sophisticated processing systems that are prevalent in modern facilities. The process control curriculum is integrated with the current motion control training by replacing outmoded segments of the curriculum, redesigning the course structure, and developing two new courses. The final segment of the curriculum modification requires new process control equipment to offer real-world experimentation opportunities to student technicians. A unique feature of the Electromechanical Technology associate degree program design is that all of the course material is formatted for individualized instruction providing greater accessibility to the technical education needed by the nontraditional students and special populations who are primarily enrolled in this degree. This model of instruction for electromechanical training has created widespread national interest in replication for other colleges as a method to address enrollment problems in traditionally designed programs and minimize equipment investments within limited budgets. *"

The learning objects reside in the digital library and support advanced electromechanical courses. Progressive indications and observations of enhanced student performance facilitated by the introduction of learning objects in the basic courses holds promise as a strategy to improve the retention of students in the advanced program courses. The digital library for electromechanical technology validates the impact of learning objects on student retention, performance and ultimately graduation."

This project responds to the local paper industry needs for trained graduates to work in integrated and automated manufacturing and research operations performing product analysis and process control using computerized data systems. The requested equipment is geared toward the rising industry standards for using increasing amounts of recycled fiber in the paper making process. Current manual equipment in the laboratories limits the curriculum to experimenting with fragments of the systems process. This project elevates the competency level of the curriculum by creating the potential for a new range of Laboratory experimentation. This curriculum will be shared with other college and university pulp and paper science programs challenged with educating students for employment in this dynamic industry."

Fab Labs are off-the-shelf, industrial-grade fabrication and electronics tools combined with open source software. Fab Labs allow students to create or invent, then build their creations. <br/><br/>The act of creation and building motivates students to study STEM. To measure this effect, the project is assessing how well the Fab Labs develop deep and long term connections between students and STEM study. The project is then using these assessments to formulate a model for attracting and sustaining students in the study of STEM fields.<br/><br/>Using Fab Labs, the project is developing a Learning Community to help drive technician education nation-wide. The project builds the Learning Community by collaborating with four ATE Centers spanning 20 schools and organizations. The collaboration is implementing Fab Labs as they share problems, solutions and expertise and further integrates existing resources into new course offerings. <br/><br/>Using webinars, workshops, mentoring, web portals and a national symposium, the program's materials and resources are being widely disseminated to encourage others to use the resources being developed."
