For the past 50 years the UWWFS has been serving the UWW and larger communities without a comprehensive plan for research, education, data storage, funding, and maintenance. In 2014 the first new director in 50 years was hired, and as of July 1, 2018 the UWW campus (previously a 2-yr undergraduate institution) will merge with UW-Milwaukee (UWM), a major research institution (4-yr undergraduate and graduate). These transitions will come with major administrative changes, but also present exciting opportunities to direct the vision of the UWWFS to increase educational, research, and outreach opportunities to the community. The potential impacts of a comprehensive strategic plan for the UWWFS include expanding formal educational opportunities in science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM) disciplines for a diverse and often under-represented population of K-12 and college students in SE Wisconsin, as well as providing field research and professional development opportunities for their faculty and staff in STEAM and related disciplines.  <br/><br/>Research at the UWWFS will help in understanding about natural resources as they can be applied to a variety of fields such as climatology, evolutionary biology, restoration ecology, and effective control methods for invasive species. Also, the unique wood-fired Anagama kiln, art classroom, and natural beauty of the station offer myriad opportunities for artists and other users from the humanities disciplines to use the station. The UWWFS resources can provide an ideal outdoor classroom for more informal community STEAM education programming so valuable for citizens in the 21st century. This facility should also serve as a model of sound environmental stewardship in the Kettle Moraine area of SE Wisconsin. Merging with UWM also presents new opportunities such as increased use by researchers from UWM and collaborative projects with the UWM Field Station. This is an opportune time to engage in a strategic planning effort to ensure a sustainable and impactful future for the UWWFS whereby activities at the station will contribute to scientific knowledge and provide environmental education to members of the community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Assembly tools are also being made available to faculty so that they may reuse and repackage these SCOs into larger grained learning modules without having to author new component objects from scratch. A prototype repository of these SCOs is under development, and the experiences of faculty in this creation and assembly process is being captured in the form of case studies."

Students move through a pipeline of STEM education from high school to a two year, associate degree-granting institution and then to degree completion at the baccalaureate institution. The goals of the project are to recruit new populations of STEM students, retain STEM students during the crucial early stages of their education, and see those students through to the completion of their baccalaureate degrees. The project includes 1) summer research workshops and research-based curriculum development at the high school level, 2) financial support, peer tutoring, faculty and peer mentoring circles, curriculum development, and participation in undergraduate research at the two year campus, and 3) a 10-week research immersion program for transferring students, continued faculty mentoring, participation in undergraduate research, and student opportunities to serve as peer mentors at the 4-year campus.<br/><br/>The complete integration of research, coursework, and mentorship across institutions ensures that STEM students have a persistent support network throughout their undergraduate career. Research activities develop critical thinking, technical skills, and confidence. Outreach and mentor support networks reach students of diverse demographic backgrounds who otherwise would be unlikely to pursue or persist in STEM education. The model is being developed for expansion across all twenty six UW-System two and four year campuses, resulting in a comprehensive effort to alleviate Wisconsin's need to increase the technology workforce.<br/>"

Nationally, 2YCs enroll over 45% of all U.S. undergraduates and serve a large number of women, minority, and first-generation college students. The 2YC teaching environment is one of the most challenging as community colleges are primarily open-access institutions that serve an extremely diverse student body; teaching loads are heavy; there is an increasing use of adjunct faculty; and support is limited for participation in faculty professional development activities. The latter issue is particularly crucial since such activities are widely recognized as the source for many innovative teaching methods shown to be critically important for improving student learning. This faculty professional development project will build a national network of self-sustaining local communities of 2YC geoscience faculty and administrators who use evidence-based strategies to improve all students' academic success and facilitate professional pathways into the STEM workforce. A program of interconnected and mutually supportive research and evaluation that is fully integrated in the project will advance knowledge and understanding of the effectiveness of a professional development model for full-time and adjunct geoscience and STEM faculty in 2YCs. <br/><br/>The project goals are to 1) implement high-impact evidence-based instructional and co-curricular practices that support the academic success of all students and promote professional pathways into geoscience; 2) build a sustainable national network of 2YC leaders who catalyze change at multiple levels from their courses to institutions in their local regions and within the community of practice; and 3) investigate models of professional development for full-time and adjunct 2YC geoscience faculty that promote the cycle of innovation, where faculty learn from the research of others, make changes in their own practice, and share what they have learned with the education community. The project's professional development program will prepare two cohorts of 2YC geoscience faculty teams to implement evidence-based instructional and co-curricular practices at their institutions. The first cohort includes twenty-four (24) full-time and adjunct faculty from seventeen (17) institutions in ten regions in the United States. National workshops, virtual professional development opportunities (e.g., journal clubs, webinars, implementation and discussion groups), and on-line resources will support faculty in implementing changes on their campus. Inclusion of administrators in the project will provide support for systemic change at each institution. The faculty teams will expand the reach of the project by engaging additional two-year and four-year institutions in their regions using a combination of workshops and follow-on activities. Virtual professional development opportunities will serve as a mechanism for increasing the reach of the project and on-line resources will provide persistent resources for the full geoscience and broader STEM communities. The project team anticipates that six-hundred (600) full-time and adjunct 2YC faculty and fifty (50) four-year college and university faculty will be engaged in professional development activities over the course of the project and that the project will impact an estimated 250,000 2YC students enrolled in geoscience courses."

The PI has been awarded a professional development fellowship to enable him to develop expertise in the philosophical foundations of quantum mechanics (the physical theory of molecular, atomic, and sub-atomic systems). He will work closely with Dr. Malcolm Forster, professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The PI has published a series of papers on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics in which he has put forth a new geometrical approach to quantum mechanics so as to address fundamental conceptual puzzles that have been debated since the inception of the theory in the 1920s.<br/><br/>The new approach begins by treating space as a part of a larger quantum mechanically defined space of states in a mathematically rigorous way. One of the core ideas of the approach is that a physical system is in the classical space (meaning the space of everyday experience) if and only if and only if quantum mechanics predicts with certainty that it has a precise position, which is usually expressed by saying that the state of the system is characterized by a Dirac delta function associated with the physical quantity position. In all other states, the particle is not in physical space. This approach provides a new interpretation of the ontological meaning of superpositions (additive combinations) of classical states; namely, that particles in superpositions are not in space. This involves the rejection of a dogma that gripped our way of thinking about reality throughout the ages: Everything that exists is located in space. Rejection of this dogma has far-reaching implications for many widely discussed issues in the foundations of quantum mechanics, such as particle-wave duality, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument and the meaning of non-locality, the nature of quantum measurement and the collapse of the wave packet.<br/><br/>With the fellowship support, the PI will develop, document, and debate the implications indicated above from a philosophical standpoint in careful, accessible, and clear manner that is well informed by the vast philosophical literature on the subject. The project promises to improve our understanding of what, if anything, quantum mechanics is telling us about the world behind the observable phenomena. It address the most fundamental and challenging problems in the philosophy of physics. The results of this research will be of interest to philosophers and theoretical physicists alike, and to any members of the general public who are interested in what contemporary physics may be telling us about the world. The even broader impact of this could be in the teaching of quantum mechanics to beginning students; especially those who want to understand the theories in terms of a ""picture"" rather than merely to learn how to use them to make calculations."
